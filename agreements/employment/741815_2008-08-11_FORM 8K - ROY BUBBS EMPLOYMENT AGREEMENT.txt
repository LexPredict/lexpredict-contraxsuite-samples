Item
1.01                      Entry
into a Material Definitive Agreement




On August 5, 2008, the Company entered
into an Employment Agreement, effective as of April 4, 2008, with its President
and Chief Executive Officer, Roy H. Bubbs.  The initial term of the
agreement is for two years and renews automatically for periods of one year,
unless terminated by the Company or Mr. Bubbs.  The material terms of
the agreement are described in Item 5.02 below.






Item
5.02


Departure
of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of
Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain
Officers









(c)           Compensatory
Arrangements of Certain Officers.




As disclosed in a Form 8K, which the
Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2008, the
Board appointed Mr. Bubbs President and Chief Executive Officer on April 4,
2008.  Mr. Bubbs had been serving as interim President and Chief
Executive officer since February 5, 2008.




The
Employment Agreement memorializes the compensatory arrangements between the
Company and Mr. Bubbs.  As previously disclosed in the aforementioned
Form 8K:






·


Mr.
Bubbs receives base salary of $500,000 per annum and participates in the
Company’s 2008 Pay for Performance Plan applicable to the Company’s
executives, under which he will have the opportunity to receive a payout
of 12.5% of his base salary ($62,500) upon achievement of a stated level
of corporate earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) at the threshold
level, 50% ($250,000) at the target level, and 100% ($500,000) at the
maximum level.











·


He
also was awarded an option exercisable for 100,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock, with an exercise price of $0.73, the closing price on April
4, 2008, the date of grant.











·


Mr.
Bubbs also receives a monthly car allowance of $700 (or 8,400 per year),
consistent with the Company’s current policy with respect to executive car
allowances.











·


On
April 9, 2008, the Company entered into an Executive Change-in-Control
Agreement with Mr. Bubbs.  Under the terms of that agreement, if
a change in control (as defined in the agreement) of the Company should
occur and, with the 12-month period following such change in control, Mr.
Bubbs’ employment is terminated (either by the Company or a successor
entity without cause, or by Mr. Bubbs with good reason), Mr. Bubbs would
be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to the sum of (i) two
times his base salary at the time of the change in control, (ii) two times
his most recent annual bonus, (iii) the amount of any annual bonus for the
calendar year in which the termination occurs, and other amounts payable
as of the date of termination.









In addition, the
Employment Agreement provides that in the event of termination of Mr. Bubbs’
employment (other than for cause or by reason of death or disability) Mr. Bubbs
will receive a lump-sum payment equal to the amount of his base salary
(at the rate in effect immediately prior to his termination) that would have
been payable to him if he had continued in employment through the longer of (A)
the balance of the initial term of his employment under this agreement, or (B)
the one-year period following the date of termination.  The Employment
Agreement also requires the Company to provide Mr. Bubbs with a monthly health
care allowance equal to the monthly cost the Company would bear if Mr. Bubbs
were insured under the Company’s group health insurance plan, it being
understood that such allowance is in lieu of Mr. Bubbs’ participation in such
plan.

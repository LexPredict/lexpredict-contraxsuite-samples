Item 1.01.
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.




On
November 17,
2006,
we
entered into employment agreements with Michael S. Yecies, our Senior Vice
President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, and Thomas C. Elliott, our Senior
Vice President-Finance and Operations. A brief description of the material
terms
and conditions of each agreement is as follows:





·
The
term of each agreement is one year; however, until we provide the
employee
written notice of termination, the term automatically renews daily
so that
on any day that the agreement is in effect prior to such notice,
the
agreement has a remaining term of one
year.









·
Mr. Yecies
will receive an annual base salary of not less than $210,000.
Mr. Elliott will receive an annual base salary of not less than
$200,000. In addition, each employee may receive incentive compensation
in
the form of cash bonus payments, stock option grants, restricted
stock
grants and other forms of incentive compensation, based upon his
performance.








Key
termination benefits under both agreements are as follows:





·
If
employment is terminated due to death, we shall pay to the employee’s
designated beneficiaries, one cash payment consisting of the following
amounts:









o
any
earned but unpaid portion of the employee’s base
salary;









o
any
accrued but unpaid vacation pay;









o
an
amount equal to one year’s base compensation as of the date of the
employee’s death; and









o
an
amount equal to the value of all incentive compensation (excluding
stock
option grants) received by the employee during the prior year ending
on
the date of the employee’s death.









·
If
we terminate the employee’s employment due to a disability of such
employee, we shall pay the employee his base compensation and any
incentive compensation (excluding stock option grants) until the
expiration of the term, payable on the dates the employee would have
been
paid if he was still working for
us.









·
If
we terminate the employee’s employment for cause, or the employee
terminates his employment for any reason other than good reason,
we shall
pay to the employee his annual base salary and vacation pay accrued
through the date of such
termination.









·
If
we terminate the employee’s employment for reasons other than his death,
disability or cause, or the employee terminates his employment for
good
reason, we shall pay to the employee his annual base salary, for
a period
of one year, payable at the time when the same would have become
due and
payable if such termination had not
occurred.





































·
If
the employee’s employment is terminated following a change in control, the
employee shall be paid amounts equal to all compensation and benefits
he
would have received if he had remained employed by us pursuant to
the
agreement through the end of the term, payable at the time when the
same
would have become due and payable if such termination had not occurred.
The incentive compensation paid to the employee shall be an amount
which
is not less than the amount of incentive compensation (excluding
stock
option grants) the employee received in the year immediately prior
to the
termination date. In addition to the foregoing, any restricted stock
of us
or our affiliates owned by the employee which is outstanding on the
termination date shall be fully vested as of the termination date
and all
options outstanding on the termination date shall be fully vested
and
exercisable in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan and
grant.









The
agreements include standard restrictive covenants not to solicit our employees
to leave our employ or our customers to cease doing business with us for a
period of one year following the date of termination.




A
copy of
Mr. Yecies’s agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is hereby
incorporated by reference. A copy of Mr. Elliott’s agreement is attached hereto
as Exhibit 10.2 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

AMENDMENT

January 25, 2000


THIS  AMENDMENT  modifies  and amends  the  Employment  Agreement  (the
"Agreement") by and between DENDRITE INTERNATIONAL,  INC. ("Dendrite") and Kathy
Donovan  ("Employee").  Unless otherwise defined herein,  capitalized terms used
herein shall have their respective meanings set forth in the Agreement.

The parties hereby agree as follows:

1.       The Agreement is hereby modified to include the following:

26.      VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS UPON "CHANGE IN CONTROL"

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary, in the event of a "Change in
Control" (as defined below),  all of Employee's options owned by him at the time
of such event  shall  immediately  vest.  For the  purposes  of this  Agreement,
"Change  in  Control"  shall  mean the  occurrence  of any one of the  following
events:

(i) any  "person"  (as such term is defined  in Section  3(a)(9) of the
Securities  and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange  Act"),  and as
used in Sections  13(d)(3)  and  14(d)(2) of the  Exchange  Act) is or becomes a
"beneficial  owner" (as defined in Rule l3d-3 under the Exchange Act),  directly
or  indirectly,  of securities of Dendrite  representing  33-1/3% or more of the
combined voting power of Dendrite's then outstanding securities eligible to vote
for the  election of the Board (the  "Dendrite  Voting  Securities");  provided,
however,  that the event  described in this paragraph (i) shall not be deemed to
be a Change in Control by virtue of any of the  following  acquisitions:  (A) by
Dendrite or any  subsidiary,  (B) by any  employee  benefit  plan  sponsored  or
maintained by Dendrite or any  subsidiary,  (C) by any  underwriter  temporarily
holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, (D) pursuant to a
Non-Control  Transaction (as defined in paragraph  (iii)),  or (E) a transaction
(other than one described in (iii) below) in which  Dendrite  Voting  Securities
are acquired from  Dendrite,  if a majority of the  Incumbent  Board (as defined
below) approves a resolution  providing expressly that the acquisition  pursuant
to this clause (E) does not  constitute a Change in Control under this paragraph
(i);

(ii)  individuals  who,  on  the  effective  date  of  this  Agreement,
constitute the Board (the "Incumbent  Board") cease for any reason to constitute
at least a  majority  thereof,  provided  that any  person  becoming  a director
subsequent to the Effective Date,  whose election or nomination for election was
approved  by a vote of at  least  two-thirds  of the  directors  comprising  the
Incumbent Board (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement
of Dendrite in which such  person is named as a nominee  for  director,  without
objection to such  nomination)  shall be  considered  a member of the  Incumbent
Board; provided, however, that no individual initially elected or nominated as a
director  of Dendrite as a result of an actual or  threatened  election  contest
with  respect to directors or any other  actual or  threatened  solicitation  of
proxies or consents by or on behalf of any person  other than the Board shall be
deemed to be a member of the Incumbent Board;

(iii) the  shareholders  of Dendrite  approve a merger,  consolidation,
share  exchange or similar form of corporate  reorganization  of Dendrite or any
such type of transaction  involving Dendrite or any of its subsidiaries (whether
for such  transaction  or the  issuance  of  securities  in the  transaction  or
otherwise)  (a  "Business  Combination"),   unless  immediately  following  such
Business  Combination:  (A)  more  than  50% of the  total  voting  power of the
publicly traded corporation resulting from such Business Combination (including,
without limitation,  any corporation which directly or indirectly has beneficial
ownership of 100% of Dendrite Voting  Securities or all or substantially  all of
the assets of Dendrite and its subsidiaries) eligible to elect directors of such
corporation  would be represented by shares that were Dendrite Voting Securities
immediately prior to such Business Combination (either by remaining  outstanding
or being  converted),  and such voting power would be in substantially  the same
proportion as the voting power of such Dendrite  Voting  Securities  immediately
prior to the Business Combination, (B) no person (other than any publicly traded
holding company resulting from such Business  Combination,  any employee benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by Dendrite (or the corporation resulting from such
Business Combination), or any person which beneficially owned, immediately prior
to  such  Business  Combination,  directly  or  indirectly,  33-1/3%  or more of
Dendrite Voting Securities (a "Dendrite 33-1/3%  Stockholder")) would become the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 33-1/3% or more of the total voting
power of the outstanding  voting  securities  eligible to elect directors of the
corporation  resulting from such Business  Combination  and no Dendrite  33-1/3%
Stockholder would increase its percentage of such total voting power, and (C) at
least a majority of the  members of the board of  directors  of the  corporation
resulting from such Business Combination would be members of the Incumbent Board
at the time of the Board's  approval of the  execution of the initial  agreement
providing for such Business Combination (a "Non-Control Transaction"); or

(iv)  the   shareholders  of  Dendrite   approve  a  plan  of  complete
liquidation  or  dissolution  of Dendrite or the sale or  disposition  of all or
substantially all of Dendrite's assets.

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  a Change in Control of Dendrite shall
not be deemed to occur solely because any person acquires  beneficial  ownership
of  more  than  33-1/3%  of  Dendrite  Voting  Securities  as a  result  of  the
acquisition of Dendrite  Voting  Securities by Dendrite  which,  by reducing the
number of Dendrite Voting  Securities  outstanding,  increases the percentage of
shares beneficially owned by such person;  provided, that if a Change in Control
of Dendrite  would occur as a result of such an  acquisition by Dendrite (if not
for the  operation of this  sentence),  and after  Dendrite's  acquisition  such
person becomes the beneficial  owner of additional  Dendrite  Voting  Securities
that  increases  the  percentage  of  outstanding   Dendrite  Voting  Securities
beneficially  owned by such person,  then a Change in Control of Dendrite  shall
occur.

27.  SEVERANCE  FOLLOWING  TERMINATION  OF  EMPLOYMENT  FOLLOWING  A "CHANGE  IN
CONTROL" "WITHOUT CAUSE" OR FOR "GOOD REASON"


(a) The  following  severance  payment  only  applies in the event of a
Change in Control. If Employee's  employment  hereunder is terminated within one
(1) year following a Change in Control (i) by Dendrite for any reason other than
death, Cause, or Disability (each as defined below) or (ii) by Employee for Good
Reason (as defined below),  the Employee -shall be entitled to receive severance
payments  in an  aggregate  amount  equal to the sum of twelve  (12) months base
salary  (calculated at the rate of base salary then being paid to Employee as of
the date of  termination).  The severance  payments to be paid to Employee under
this  Section  shall be referred  to herein as the "Change in Control  Severance
Payment".  Employee's  Change  In  Control  Severance  Payment  shall be paid by
Dendrite in cash in twelve (12) consecutive  equal monthly  payments  commencing
not later than thirty (30) days after the effective  date of the  termination of
Employee's employment. No interest shall accrue or be payable on or with respect
to any Change in Control  Severance  Payment.  In the event of a termination  of
Employee's  employment  described in this  Section,  Employee  shall be provided
continued  "COBRA"  coverage  pursuant  to  Sections  601 et seq. of ERISA under
Dendrite's  group  medical and dental  plans.  During the period which  Employee
receives  the  Change in Control  Severance  Payment,  Employee's  cost of COBRA
coverage  shall be the same as the amount paid by  employees of Dendrite for the
same coverage under  Dendrite's  group health and dental plans.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  in the event Employee becomes  re-employed with another employer
and becomes eligible to receive health coverage from such employer,  the payment
of COBRA  coverage by Dendrite as described  herein  shall  cease.  In the event
Employee is entitled to the Change in Control  Severance Payment as set forth in
this Section,  Employee  shall not be entitled to any other  severance  payments
from Dendrite.

(b) The making of any Change in Control  Severance  Payment  under this
Section  is  conditioned  upon the  signing  of a  general  release  in form and
substance  satisfactory to Dendrite under which Employee  releases  Dendrite and
its affiliates together with their respective officers, directors, shareholders,
employees,  agents and  successors  and assigns from any and all claims,  he may
have  against  them.  In the event  Employee  breaches  any of the  covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedies at law
or in equity,  Dendrite may cease making any Change in Control Severance Payment
otherwise due under this Section.  Nothing herein shall affect any of Employee's
obligations or Dendrite's rights under this Agreement.

(c) For purposes of this  Agreement,  "Cause" as used herein shall mean
(i) any gross  misconduct  on the part of  Employee  with  respect to his duties
under this  Agreement,  (ii) the engaging by Employee in an  indictable  offense
which  relates to Employee's  duties under this  Agreement or which is likely to
have a material adverse effect on the business of Dendrite, (iii) the commission
by Employee  of any willful or  intentional  act which  injures in any  material
respect or could  reasonably  be expected to injure in any material  respect the
reputation,  business or business  relationships of Dendrite,  including without
limitation, a breach of any of his covenants or agreements of this Agreement, or
(iv) the engaging by Employee  through gross negligence in conduct which injures
materially or could reasonably be expected to injure  materially the business or
reputation of Dendrite.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement,  "Good Reason" as used herein shall
mean, without  Employee's  express written consent,  concurrently with or within
one (1) year following a "Change in Control" (as defined above),  the occurrence
of any of the  following  events  which is not  corrected  within  ten (10) days
following notice of such event given by Employee to Dendrite:

(i)   the   assignment   to   Employee   of  any   duties   or
responsibilities  materially and adversely inconsistent with Employee's position
(including  any material  diminution  of such duties or  responsibilities)  or a
material and adverse change in Employee's reporting responsibilities,  titles or
offices with Dendrite;

(ii) any material  breach by Dendrite of this  Agreement  with
respect to the making of any compensation payments;

(iii) any  requirement  of  Dendrite  that  Employee  be based
anywhere  other than in a  thirty-five  (35) mile radius of the Dendrite  office
Employee is based in on the date of consummation of the Change in Control;

(iv) the  failure  of  Dendrite  to  continue  in  effect  any
employee benefit plan, compensation plan, welfare benefit plan or fringe benefit
plan (such plans being referred to herein as "Welfare  Plans") in which Employee
is participating as of the effective date of this Agreement (or as such benefits
and  compensation  may be  increased  from time to time),  or the  taking of any
action by Dendrite  which  would  materially  and  adversely  affect  Employee's
participation  in or materially  reduce  Employee's  benefits under such Welfare
Plans  (other than an  across-the-board  reduction  of such  benefits  affecting
senior  executives of Dendrite)  unless (i) Employee is permitted to participate
in other plans providing  Employee with  substantially  comparable  benefits (at
substantially  comparable cost with respect to the Welfare Plans), (ii) any such
Welfare  Plan does not provide  material  benefits to  Employee  (determined  in
relation to Employee's compensation and benefits package), (iii) such failure or
action is taken at the  direction of Employee or with his consent,  or (iv) such
failure or action is required by law; or

(v) the  failure of  Dendrite  to obtain an  agreement  from a
successor employer to assume Dendrite's  obligations under this Agreement in the
event of a "Change in Control."

Employee  must notify  Dendrite  of any event  constituting  Good Reason  within
ninety (90) days  following  Employee's  knowledge  of its  existence,  it being
understood  that  Employee's  failure  to do so shall  deem  such  event  not to
constitute Good Reason under this Agreement.

(e) For  purposes of this  Agreement,  "Disabled"  as used herein shall
have the same meaning as that term, or such  substantially  equivalent term, has
in any group disability  policy carried by Dendrite.  If no such policy exists.,
the term  "Disabled"  shall  mean  the  occurrence  of any  physical  or  mental
condition  which  materially  interferes  with  the  performance  of  Employee's
customary  duties in his capacity as an employee where such  disability has been
in effect for a consecutive six (6) month period (excluding  permitted  vacation
time), the existence of which is supported by credible medical evidence.

2. Except as expressly modified by this Amendment, all of the terms and
conditions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

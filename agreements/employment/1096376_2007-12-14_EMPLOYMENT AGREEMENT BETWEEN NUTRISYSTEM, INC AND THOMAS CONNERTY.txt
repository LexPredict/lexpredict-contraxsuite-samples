(e)        On November 30, 2007 (the "Effective Date"), NutriSystem, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Thomas F. Connerty, the Company's Executive Vice President, Program Development and Chief Marketing Officer.  Under the amended and restated agreement, Mr. Connerty's salary was increased to $350,000 per year and he is eligible to receive, at the time bonuses are awarded each year, a target bonus of up to 70% of his aggregate compensation earned as salary each year during the term of the agreement and a stretch bonus of up to 130% of such amount.
On the Effective Date, Mr. Connerty was granted 79,523 under a stock award agreement (the "Stock Grant").  The Stock Grant will vest in four equal installments of 20% over four years from the Effective Date, and in one installment of 20% on April 1, 2009.  In the event of a Chang
e of Control (as defined in the employment agreement), Mr. Connerty shall become fully vested in the Stock Grant on the date of the Change of Control.
On the Effective Date, Mr. Connerty also entered into a nondisclosure and noncompete agreement with the Company.  Under this agreement, Mr. Connerty, for two years after termination of his employment, agreed not to compete with the Company and, for at least one year, he will not participate in the health and wellness business regardless of whether the Company is engaged in such business.
The term of the employment agreement begins on the Effective Date and extends for five years.  If Mr. Connerty is terminated without cause, then, in exchange for a mutual release, (1) the Company will pay a lump sum severance payment in an amount equal to (a) 12 months of the salary then in effect and (b) the value of the premium costs to the Company to continue Mr. Connerty on
the Company's group life and accident, death, and disability policy for the 12 month period following Mr. Connerty's termination date, (2) the Company will provide group healthcare coverage for 12 months at Mr. Connerty's normal contribution rates, (3) Mr. Connerty's covenants against non-competition will be reduced by one half, and (4) certain unvested shares of the Stock Grant, pursuant to the Stock Award Agreement, shall become vested on the termination date.
The foregoing is only a summary of the employment agreement, stock award agreement and nondisclosure and noncompete agreement. You are urged to read each agreement in its entirety for a more complete description of its terms and conditions.  A copy of each agreement is attached to this report as.

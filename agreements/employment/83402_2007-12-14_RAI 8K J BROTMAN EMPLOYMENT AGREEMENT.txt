Item 8.01                      Other

Resource
America, Inc. (the “Company”)
appointed Jeffrey F. Brotman as Executive Vice President on June 18,
2007.  The Company has determined that Mr. Brotman, based upon the
duties he has performed since his appointment, will be deemed an executive
officer of the Company effective as of December 11, 2007.




In
connection with Mr. Brotman’s appointment, the Company entered into an
employment agreement with Mr. Brotman on June 18, 2007 (the “Employment
Agreement”). Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Brotman will receive a
base salary of $350,000 per year which may be increased by the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors based upon its evaluation of Mr. Brotman’s
performance.  Mr. Brotman is eligible to receive cash bonus payments,
stock option grants, restricted stock grants and other forms of incentive
compensation, based upon his performance. Mr. Brotman is entitled to participate
in all employee benefit plans in effect during his period of
employment.




The
Employment Agreement has a term of one year and, until notice to the contrary,
the term is automatically extended so that, on any day on which the agreement
is
in effect, it has a then-current one year term.  The Company may
terminate the automatic extensions by providing Mr. Brotman with written
notice
of its election to terminate the Employment Agreement at the end of the
one year
period then in effect. The Company may terminate Mr. Brotman sooner in
the event
of Mr. Brotman’s death, if he is disabled for more than 180 days in the
aggregate or more than 90 consecutive days in any calendar year, for cause
(as
defined in the Employment Agreement) or without cause upon 30 days’ prior
notice.  Mr. Brotman also has the right to terminate the Employment
Agreement upon a change in control (as defined in the Employment Agreement)
or
and for good reason (as defined in the Employment
Agreement).  Otherwise, Mr. Brotman can terminate the Employment
Agreement upon 180 days’ notice.




The
Employment Agreement provides the
following termination benefits:






·


upon
termination due to death, Mr. Brotman’s beneficiaries will receive a lump
sum payment equal to (i) any portion of his base compensation
that has
been earned but not paid, (ii) any accrued but unpaid vacation
pay, (iii)
one year’s base compensation and (iv) the value of all incentive
compensation, excluding stock option grants, received Mr. Brotman
in the
year preceding his death;










·


upon
termination due to disability, Mr. Brotman will receive his base
compensation and any incentive compensation, excluding stock
option
grants, until the expiration of his term, payable on the dates
he
otherwise would have been paid;










·


upon
termination by the Company other than for cause, death or disability,
or
by Mr. Brotman for good reason, Mr. Brotman will receive his
base
compensation, incentive compensation, excluding equity based
compensation
grants, in an amount which is not less than the amount of incentive
compensation he received in the year preceding his death, and
continuation
of life, health, accident and disability insurance benefits for
one year,
payable on the dates he otherwise would have been paid;
and











·


upon
termination by Mr. Brotman within six months following a change
in
control, or upon termination by the Company in anticipation or
within six
months following a change in control, Mr. Brotman will receive
(i) his
base compensation and incentive compensation, excluding stock
option
grants, for one year, for a period of 30 months, payable on the
dates he
otherwise would have been paid or in a lump sum if the change
of control
is due to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, division or
other
reorganization or transaction of the Company, (b) continuation
of life,
health, accident and disability insurance benefits for one year
and (c)
automatic vesting of all stock and option awards.  The incentive
compensation paid will not be less than that received by Mr.
Brotman in
the year preceding the termination.









The
Employment Agreement also contains a non-solicitation covenant that extends
for
one year following termination of employment with the Company as well as
a
confidentiality covenant that survives the termination of the Employment
Agreement.

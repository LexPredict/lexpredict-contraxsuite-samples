3. Incentive Plan and Bonus (Section 4(b) of the Agreement). The Agreement is hereby
amended by the addition of Section 4(b)(iii) as follows:
4(b)(iii) 2004 Equity Plan. The Executive shall be eligible to participate in a
Restricted Stock Pool (the “Pool”) each year during the Term of Employment unless notified prior to the beginning of the year by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”)
that the Executive will not participate in the Pool during the following year.
The Pool shall be determined by reference to Anworth’s Return on
Average Equity as more fully described in Exhibit A to this Agreement, and shall be allocated among the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Investment Officer based on the assessment by the Compensation Committee of each participant’s
performance.
The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, can adjust the aggregate Pool downward in any year by as much as ten percent
(10%) depending upon the Compensation Committee’s assessment of Anworth’s leverage, book value stability and share price relative to peer group, among other considerations.
Fifty percent (50%) of any amount in excess of $100,000 allocated to the Executive from the Pool with respect to calendar year 2008 and each subsequent year will be
paid in restricted stock in accordance with the 2004 Equity Plan.
Such restricted stock cannot be transferred or sold during the Executive’s
employment by Anworth until the value of the Executive’s stock holdings in Anworth exceeds seven and one-half times the Salary; and then the restricted stock may be sold or transferred only to the extent that the value of the Executive’s
stock holdings exceeds this multiple of Salary.
If the Compensation Committee should notify the Executive prior to the following year that the Executive
will not participate in the Pool during the following year, the sale or transfer restrictions on previously issued Pool shares will be eliminated at that time.
4. Restricted Stock Pool (Exhibit A). The Agreement is hereby amended by the addition of Exhibit A to the Agreement, which is attached to this Fourth Addendum as Exhibit A.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Fourth Addendum to Employment Agreement is executed as of the day and year first above written.

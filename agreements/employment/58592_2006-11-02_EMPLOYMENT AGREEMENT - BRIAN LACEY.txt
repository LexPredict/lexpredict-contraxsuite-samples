Re: Employment
Agreement



Dear Brian:



I
refer you to your Employment Agreement dated July 1, 2003 (the “Employment
Agreement”) with 4Kids Entertainment Licensing, Inc. (“Employer”).



This
letter hereby amends the Employment Agreement as follows:



1.
Paragraph 2 (a) of your Employment Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety
and replaced by the following:













“(a)

The term of Employee’s employment hereunder (“Term”) shall
commence on July 1, 2003 and shall continue until December 31, 2009 unless
terminated earlier as provided in Paragraph 10 of this Agreement.”











2.
Paragraph 3 (a) of your Employment Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety
and replaced by the following:













“(a)

Salary. As compensation for Employee’s services during the January
1, 2002 through December 31, 2005 period of the Term, Employer shall pay
Employee a salary at the rate of Three Hundred Fifty Thousand ($350,000) per
year. As compensation for Employee’s services during the January 1, 2006
through December 31, 2006 period of the Term, Employer shall pay Employee a
salary at the rate of Five Hundred Thousand ($500,000) per year. As compensation
for Employee’s services during the January 1, 2007 through December 31,
2007 period of the Term, Employer shall pay Employee a salary at the rate of
Five Hundred Fifty Thousand ($550,000) per year. As compensation for
Employee’s services during the January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009
period of the Term, Employer shall pay Employee a salary at the rate of Six
Hundred Thousand ($600,000) per year. The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of 4Kids (“Compensation Committee”) shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to provide Employee with salary increases, from time to
time, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee.”

















3.
Paragraph 4 (a) of your Employment Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety
and replaced by the following:














“(a)

For the 2002-2005 period, Employee shall be eligible to participate in the
bonus pool established by the Compensation Committee (the “Bonus
Pool”), which Bonus Pool shall be based upon a percentage designated by the
Compensation Committee of the profit before tax of 4Kids and subsidiaries. The
Compensation Committee and the CEO of 4Kids, in their sole and absolute
discretion, shall determine the amount of the Bonus Pool, if any, to be awarded
to Employee based upon Employee’s performance during the calendar year in
question. Commencing with Employer’s 2006 fiscal year, in addition to the
salary specified in Paragraph 3 (a), Employee shall be entitled to receive an
annual cash bonus for each full fiscal year or portion of a fiscal year during
the Term based upon such quantitative and qualitative criteria as shall be
established by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, in connection
with Employer’s business plan, if any, for such fiscal year, and as such
business plan may be amended from time to time.”











4.
Paragraph 4 (b) (i) of your Employment Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
the first sentence in its entirety and substituting the following new first
sentence:













“(b)(i)

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for each of calendar years
2002 through and including 2005, Employer shall pay Employee a minimum bonus
(“MB”) of not less than One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000)
subject to the following reduction: the MB with respect to any calendar year
during the 2002-2005 period shall be reduced by an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the Annual Stock Option Value (as defined below), if any, with respect
to the applicable calendar year for which the MB is to be paid (“Applicable
Calendar Year”).”












5.
Paragraph 10 of your Employment Agreement is hereby amended by adding new
subparagraph 10 (i):



“(i)
Notwithstanding anything in Paragraphs 10 (c), 10 (d) or 10 (f) to the contrary,
Employee shall not receive or be credited with any MB with respect to services
rendered and to be rendered by Employee in calendar years 2006-2009.”












6.
The parties agree that the following new Paragraph 19 shall be added to the
Agreement:













“19.

Necessary Amendments to Comply with Section 409A. The parties hereto
acknowledge that it is possible that payments to be made hereunder may be
subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
any regulations or other guidance issued thereunder (“Section 409A”),
and that the requirements of Section 409A are still being developed and
interpreted at this time. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event that either party reasonably determines that amendments
to this Agreement are necessary or appropriate in order to comply with
Section 409A, including amendments necessary to ensure that such payments
will not be subject to Section 409A, Employer and Employee shall negotiate
in good faith to amend the Agreement on a prospective or retroactive basis, in a
manner that is mutually satisfactory to the parties.”












Except
as specifically amended herein, the Employment Agreement remains in full force and effect.



Within ten
(10) business days of the execution and delivery of this letter amendment, Employer shall
pay Employee the difference between the payments that Employee has received to date in
2006 calculated at the rate of $350,000 per annum and the payments that Employee would
have received to date in 2006 if his salary were calculated at the rate of $500,000 per
annum. For the balance of 2006, Employee shall be paid at the rate of $500,000 per annum.



Please
confirm your agreement to the foregoing Amendment to your Employment Agreement by signing
and dating the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to me.













Sincerely
yours,
4Kids Entertainment Licensing, Inc.

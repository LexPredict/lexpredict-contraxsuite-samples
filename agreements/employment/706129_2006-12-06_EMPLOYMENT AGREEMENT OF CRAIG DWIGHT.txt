On
December 1, 2006, Horizon Bancorp (the “Company”)
and
its wholly owned subsidiary, Horizon Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”),
entered into a new employment agreement with Craig M. Dwight. The agreement
provides that Mr. Dwight will continue to serve as the Company’s President
and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
for a term of three years. The term of the agreement will be extended for
an
additional one-year period beyond the then-effective expiration date on each
annual anniversary of the date of the agreement until the year in which
Mr. Dwight reaches the age of sixty-three, unless the Company delivers
notice to Mr. Dwight within sixty days prior to the expiration of any
one-year period that the term will not be extended. Mr. Dwight currently is
forty-nine years old.



The
agreement also provides that Mr. Dwight will continue to receive an annual
base salary equal to the amount being paid to him on the date of the agreement,
subject to adjustment based on the annual review of the Company’s Board of
Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, but the
adjusted base salary amount may not be less than Mr. Dwight’s base salary
on the date of the agreement. Mr. Dwight’s base salary for fiscal 2006 is $
280,000.



The
Company may terminate Mr. Dwight’s employment immediately for “cause” as
defined in the agreement. The Company also may terminate Mr. Dwight’s
employment without cause upon not less than thirty days’ prior notice.
Mr. Dwight may terminate his employment for “good reason” as defined in the
agreement or upon not less than thirty days’ prior notice without good
reason.



If
the
Company terminates Mr. Dwight’s employment without cause, if
Mr. Dwight terminates his employment with good reason, or if
Mr. Dwight’s employment is terminated upon a change in control of the
Company, the agreement provides for the Company to pay Mr. Dwight an amount
equal to two times his then-current annual base salary plus his bonus for
the
previous two calendar years and for Mr. Dwight to receive health and
certain other benefits for a two-year period.



The
agreement also includes provisions protecting the Company’s and the Bank’s
confidential business information and from competition by
Mr. Dwight.



Also
on
December 1, 2006, the Bank entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Dwight
that provides that the new employment agreement supersedes, cancels and replaces
the change-of-control agreement, dated October 7, 1999, between the Bank
and
Mr. Dwight.



Copies
of
the employment agreement and letter agreement are attached as exhibits to
this
Current Report on Form 8-K.

(b)


During, and for a period of 1 year after the termination of employment with the Company, you will not: (i) knowingly interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt, any then existing relationship, contractual or otherwise between the Company, its subsidiaries, or affiliated entities, and any customer, client, supplier, or agent; (ii) solicit, or assist

You recognize that, by reason of your employment hereunder, you may acquire confidential information and trade secrets concerning the operation of the Group and of the clients of the Group, the use or disclosure of which could cause the Group substantial loss and damages that could not be readily calculated and for which no remedy under applicable law
would be adequate. Accordingly, you covenant and agree with the Company that you will not, either during the term of your employment hereunder or at any time thereafter, disclose, furnish or make accessible to any person, firm or corporation (except in the ordinary course of business in performance of your obligations to the Group hereunder or with the prior written consent of the Company pursuant to authority granted by a resolution of the Company) any confidential
information that you have learned or may learn by reason of your association with the Group. As used in this Paragraph 6, the term “confidential information” shall include, without limitation, information not previously disclosed to the public or any governmental agency by the Group with respect to the business or affairs of the Group including, without limitation, information relating to business opportunities, trade secrets, systems, techniques, procedures,
methods, inventions, facilities, financial information, business plans or prospects. Upon termination of this Employment Agreement, you shall immediately return to the Company all documents, records and information in your possession (whether in paper or electronic format) and shall affirmatively confirm and represent that you have not retained any copies thereof.






7.





Without intending to limit the remedies available to the Company, you acknowledge that a breach of the covenants and agreements contained in Paragraph 6 of this Agreement may result in material irreparable injury to the Group for which there is no adequate remedy at law and that it will not be possible to precisely measure damages for such injuries.
Therefore, in the event of such a breach or threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to obtain a

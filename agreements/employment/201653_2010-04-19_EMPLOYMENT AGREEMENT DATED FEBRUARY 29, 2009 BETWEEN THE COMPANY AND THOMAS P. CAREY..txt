AGREEMENT



1.     Effective as
of the Effective Time:



(a)Section
1.23 of the Employment Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced
with the
following:



""Restricted

Termination for whatever reason or occurrence, provided in the event of any
violation of Section 8, the Restricted Period shall be extended by a period of
time equal to that period beginning when the violation commenced and ending when
the violation terminated."































(b)The
reference in Section 8.1 of the Employment Agreement to the phrase "the Company
within a
twenty-five (25) mile radius of the Company's current or future dialysis

Employment Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced with "the Company within a
fifty (50) mile radius of the Company's and its affiliates' current or future
dialysis facilities".



2.   Within 48
hours of the Board Appointment Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and as
partial consideration for Executive's obligations set forth in Section 1(a) and

3.   Except as
set forth herein, the Parties' rights under the Employment Agreement shall
remain unaffected and shall continue in full force and effect. This Amendment is

other term or condition of the Employment Agreement or waiver of any of the
Parties' rights under the Employment Agreement.



4.   This
Amendment shall form a part of the Employment Agreement for all purposes, and
the Parties shall be bound hereby. From and after the execution of this
Amendment by the Parties, any reference to the Employment Agreement shall be
deemed a reference to the Employment Agreement as amended hereby (unless the
context specifically requires otherwise).



5.   This
Amendment may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon
the same instrument. This Amendment shall become effective when each Party shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed the other Party. Signatures to this
Amendment transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in pdf form,
or by any other electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and

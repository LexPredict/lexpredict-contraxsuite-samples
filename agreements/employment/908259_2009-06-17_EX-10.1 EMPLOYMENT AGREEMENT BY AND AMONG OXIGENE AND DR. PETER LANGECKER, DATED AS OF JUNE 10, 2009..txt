Exhibit 10.1




EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT




This Employment
Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into as of June 10th, 2009 by and
between OXiGENE, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“OXiGENE”), and Peter Langecker (the “Executive”).



W I T N E S S E T H   :




WHEREAS, OXiGENE and Executive desire to enter into an employment agreement relating to
the position of OXiGENE’s Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer.



NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby mutually acknowledged, OXiGENE and Executive hereby agree as follows:



1. Employment



Executive shall serve in the capacity of Executive Vice President and Chief Development
Officer, and shall have the duties, responsibilities and authority assigned to Executive by
OXiGENE’s Chief Executive Officer to whom he shall report.



Executive, so long as he is employed hereunder, (i) shall devote substantially all of his full
professional time and attention to the services required of him as an employee of OXiGENE, except
as otherwise agreed and except as permitted in accordance with paid vacation time subject to
OXiGENE’s existing vacation policy, and subject to OXiGENE’s existing policies pertaining to
reasonable periods of absence due to sickness, personal injury or other disability, (ii) shall use
his best efforts to promote the interests of OXiGENE, and (iii) shall discharge his
responsibilities in a diligent and faithful manner, consistent with sound business practices.
Notwithstanding the above, Executive may continue to serve as a consultant/advisor for the entities
listed on Exhibit A provided that such service does not create any conflicts, ethical or otherwise,
with Executive’s responsibilities to OXiGENE and further provided that Executive’s time commitments
do not unreasonably interfere with his fulfillment of his responsibilities hereunder, as determined
by OXiGENE.



2. Term



The term of Executive’s employment under this Agreement shall commence at a date mutually
agreed upon by the parties, in any case not later than June 30, 2009, and shall continue until
terminated by either party in accordance with Section 6 hereof (the “Employment Term”).



3. Base Salary; Stock Options, Sign-on Bonus



3.1 During the Employment Term, Executive initially shall be paid an annual base salary in
the amount of $350,000 (such amount as adjusted, from time to time, the


















“Base Salary”), payable in biweekly (26) installments in accordance with OXiGENE’s payroll schedule
from time to time in effect. The Base Salary will be subject to review annually or on such periodic
basis (not to exceed annually) as OXiGENE reviews the compensation of OXiGENE’s other senior
executives and may be adjusted upwards in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of OXiGENE
(the “Board”) or its designee. Executive will be eligible during each year of the Employment Term
for consideration for an annual bonus (the “Annual Bonus”) equal to up to forty percent (40%) of
his then-current Base Salary, based upon OXiGENE’s assessment of the performance of Executive and
OXiGENE at the sole discretion of OXiGENE, to be paid prior to March 15th of the year following the
year in which the Annual Bonus is earned. The Annual Bonus is based on the achievement of
individual and Company written goals established on an annual basis and on overall Company
performance. Executive shall be eligible for a pro-rated Annual Bonus for 2009. The Board may in
its discretion award Executive a more generous bonus.




3.2 OXiGENE shall grant to Executive, subject to approval by the
Compensation Committee of the Board, options to purchase two hundred fifty thousand (250,000)
shares of OXiGENE’s common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of such stock
on the date of grant pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of OXiGENE’s 2005 Stock Plan (the
“Stock Plan”) and OXiGENE’s standard form of option agreement within 60 days of Executive’s first
day of employment. To the extent allowed by law, the options shall be treated as incentive options.
The options shall vest in four equal annual increments over the four (4) year period measured from
the date of grant of such options, with vesting to begin on the one (1) year anniversary of the
grant date. In addition, Executive shall be eligible to receive stock option grants, stock bonuses,
restricted stock grants or other equity compensation awards granted to Executive from time to time
by the Board in its sole discretion and to participate in any equity compensation plan that may be
established by OXiGENE for Executive or its executive team generally.



3.3 Executive shall earn a signing bonus (the “Commencement Bonus”) in the amount of seventy
thousand dollars ($70,000), payable on the first payroll date following Executive’s first day of
employment. If Executive’s employment hereunder is terminated either by OXiGENE for Cause or
voluntarily by Executive in the absence of a Good Reason (as defined in Section 6.6) within one (1)
year of the Commencement Date, Executive will promptly repay a portion of the Commencement Bonus
equal to the amount of the Commencement Bonus, net of applicable taxes and deductions, multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of days from the effective date of such
termination to the first anniversary of the Commencement Date and the denominator of which will be
365.




4.	 	Benefits

Executive shall be entitled to participate in employee benefit plans and arrangements
made available by OXiGENE generally to OXiGENE employees of comparable title or
responsibilities during the Employment Term.


























5. Business Expenses



5.1 Executive shall be entitled to receive an American Express Corporate Card (or other card
should OXiGENE change to another card issuer), for business related expenses and prompt
reimbursement will be made for all reasonable and customary expenses incurred by him in performing
services hereunder during the Employment Term; provided that such expenses are incurred and
accounted for in accordance with the policies and procedures established by OXiGENE.



6. Termination



6.1 Executive may resign from employment with OXiGENE upon written notice to OXiGENE.



6.2 If Executive’s employment is terminated by OXiGENE other than for Cause (as defined
below) or Executive’s disability, then OXiGENE shall provide to Executive the following
termination compensation:




(a)	 	payments equal to Executive’s then-current Base Salary for a period of
twelve (12) months, payable on OXiGENE’s normal paydays.

(b)	 	a payment equal to the portion of the Executive’s Base Salary that has
accrued prior to any termination of the Executive’s employment with OXiGENE that
has not yet been paid;

(c)	 	to the extent required by law and OXiGENE’s policy, an amount equal to the
value of the Executive’s accrued but unused vacation days;

(d)	 	the amount of any expenses properly incurred by the Executive on behalf of
OXiGENE prior to any termination and not yet reimbursed;

(e)	 	the Annual Bonus related to the most recently completed calendar year, if not
already paid, and

(f)	 	should Executive timely elect and be eligible for COBRA coverage, payment of
Executive’s COBRA premiums for the Executive and the Executive’s immediate
family’s medical and dental insurance coverage for a period of twelve (12)
months; provided, that OXiGENE shall have no obligation to provide such coverage
if Executive becomes eligible for medical and dental coverage with another
employer. Executive shall give prompt written notice to the Company on attaining
such eligibility.


























Such payments described in Sections 6.2 (b), (c) and (e), shall be payable upon Executive’s
last day of employment, or as otherwise allowable by law; such payments described in Section (d)
shall be payable upon Executive’s last day of employment, or on the earliest practicable date
after Executive provides proof of the expenses and the business purpose thereof. Such payments
described in Sections 6.2(a) and (f), unless otherwise required by law, shall be paid or commence
to be paid within ninety (90) days of Executive’s termination of employment provided Executive has
delivered to OXiGENE and has not thereafter revoked a general release within forty-five (45) days
of Executive’s termination of employment.



6.3 If, following any Change in Control (as such term is defined below) and prior to the
expiration of one (1) year from the date of such Change in Control, (1) Executive’s employment
is terminated (other than for Cause or the Executive’s disability) or (2) in the event of a
termination with Good Reason, then




(a)	 	Executive shall receive, within sixty (60) days after Executive’s
termination of employment:






(i)	 	A lump sum payment of an amount equal to twelve (12) months of
Executive’s then current Base Salary; and

(ii)	 	the termination compensation described in Sections 6.2(b), (c),
(d), (e) and (f) above, payable as described, and subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2, above.






(b)	 	All stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other
incentive compensation granted to the Executive by OXiGENE shall vest and be
immediately exercisable. Executive may exercise all such vested options and
rights, and shall receive payments and distributions accordingly




“Change in Control” shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:





(i)	 	Ownership. Any “Person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becomes the “Beneficial Owner” (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of
OXiGENE representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power
represented by OXiGENE’s then outstanding voting securities (excluding for this
purpose any such voting securities held by OXiGENE or its affiliates or by any
employee benefit plan of
OXiGENE) pursuant to a transaction or a series of related transaction which the
Board of Directors does not approve; or

(ii)	 	Merger/Sale of Assets. (A) A merger or consolidation of
OXiGENE whether or not approved by the Board of Directors, other than
a merger or consolidation which would result in the





















voting securities of OXiGENE outstanding immediately prior thereto
continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being
converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or the parent of
such corporation) at least 50% of the total voting power represented by
the voting securities of OXiGENE or such surviving entity or parent of
such corporation, as the case may be, outstanding immediately after such
merger or consolidation; or (B) the stockholders of OXiGENE approve an
agreement for the sale or disposition by OXiGENE of all or substantially
all of OXiGENE’s assets; or

(iii)	 	Change in Board Composition. A change in the composition of the
Board of Directors, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the
directors are Incumbent Directors. “Incumbent Directors” shall mean
directors who either (A) are directors of OXiGENE as of the date of this
Agreement, or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board of
Directors with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the
Incumbent Directors at the time of such election or nomination (but shall
not include an individual whose election or nomination is in connection
with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of
directors to OXiGENE).




For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in Control must also meet the requirements of a “Change
in Control Event” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5).




6.4 Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 6 or as required by applicable law, all
obligations of OXiGENE under this Agreement shall cease if, during the Employment Term, OXiGENE
terminates Executive for Cause or Executive resigns for other than Good Reason. Upon such
termination, Executive shall be entitled to receive only the termination compensation described
under Sections 6.2(b), (c), (d) and (e).



6.5 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Cause” shall mean any of the following:




(a)	 	Executive’s substantial failure to perform any of his duties hereunder or to
follow reasonable, lawful directions of the Board or any officer to whom
Executive reports;

(b)	 	Executive’s willful misconduct or willful malfeasance in connection
with his employment;

(c)	 	Executive’s conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, any crime
constituting a felony under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, or
any other crime involving moral turpitude;





















(d)	 	Executive’s material breach of any provision of this Agreement, OXiGENE’s
bylaws or any other agreement with OXiGENE; or

(e)	 	Executive’s engaging in misconduct that causes significant injury to OXiGENE,
financial or otherwise, or to its reputation; or

(f)	 	any act, omission or circumstance constituting cause under the law governing
this Agreement.




If Cause arises under Section 6.5(a), (b), (d), (e), or (f), Executive shall be given a minimum
period of thirty (30) days to reasonably cure such Cause (if reasonably subject to cure).




6.6 For the purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason” shall mean:
(i) without the Executive’s express written consent, any material reduction in Executive’s title,
or responsibilities compared to those prior to a Change in Control (as such term is defined in
Section 6.3); (ii) relocation of more than 60 miles; (iii) without the Executive’s express written
consent, a material reduction by OXiGENE in the Executive’s total compensation as in effect on the
date hereof or as the same may be increased from time to time, provided that it shall not be deemed
a material reduction if (a) the amount of Executive’s Annual Bonus is less than the amount of any
previously awarded Annual Bonuses or (b) a benefit is amended and such amendment affects all
eligible executive participants; or (iv) OXiGENE breaches a material term of this Agreement and
such breach has remained uncured for a minimum of thirty (30) days after Executive has notified
OXiGENE of breach. To be effective, such notice must be in writing and set forth the specific
alleged Good Reason for termination and the factual basis supporting the alleged Good Reason. For
purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason must also meet the requirements for a good reason
termination in accordance with Treasury Regulation §1.409A-1(n)(2), and any successor statute,
regulation and guidance thereto.



6.7 The foregoing payments upon Executive’s termination shall constitute the exclusive
payments due Executive upon termination of his employment with OXiGENE under this Agreement or
otherwise, provided, however that except as stated above, such payments shall have no effect on
any benefits which may be payable to Executive under any plan of OXiGENE which provides benefits
after termination of employment.



7 Taxes.



Any amounts or benefits payable or provided to Executive hereunder shall be paid or provided
to Executive subject to all applicable taxes required to be withheld by OXiGENE pursuant to
relevant federal, state and/or local law.
Executive shall be solely responsible for all taxes imposed on Executive by reason of his receipt
of any amounts of compensation or benefits payable hereunder and OXiGENE makes no representation,
warranty or promise regarding the tax treatment of any payment or benefit provided to Executive.



8 Non-Competition/Non-Solicitation



















8.1 While Executive is employed by OXiGENE, Executive shall not, for himself or on behalf of
any other person or entity, directly or indirectly, whether as principal, partner, agent,
independent contractor, stockholder, employee, consultant, representative or in any other capacity,
own, manage, operate or control, be concerned or connected with, or employed by, engage in or have
a financial interest in any Restricted Business (as defined in Section 8.3) anywhere in the world
(the “Restricted Territory”) except that nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Executive from
purchasing or owning securities of any such business if such securities are publicly traded, and
provided that Executive’s holdings do not exceed two percent (2%) of the issued and outstanding
securities of any class of securities of such Restricted Business.



8.2 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Restricted Business” shall mean any person,
partnership, corporation, business organization or other entity (or a division or business unit of
any entity) whose primary business is the research, development, manufacture, marketing or selling
of products or services that are the same as or similar to those that OXiGENE is researching,
developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling during Executive’s employment with OXiGENE,
provided that (i) after Executive’s employment with OXiGENE has terminated, this definition shall
apply only with respect to products and services that are the same as or similar to those that
OXiGENE was engaged in or developing during the immediately prior two (2) years of Executive’s
employment with OXiGENE; (ii) nothing in this definition shall operate to prevent Executive from
working for or with respect to any subsidiary, division or affiliate (each, a “Unit”) of an entity
if that Unit is not itself a Restricted Business, irrespective of whether another Unit of such
entity constitutes a Restricted Business (as long as Executive does not provide any services for
such other Unit); and (iii) Restricted Business will not include researching, developing,
manufacturing, marketing or selling products or services other than those specific products
(vascular disrupting agents) being researched, developed, manufactured, marketed, or sold by or on
behalf of OXiGENE when Executive’s employment with OXiGENE terminates.



8.3 While Executive is employed by OXiGENE, and for a period of twelve (12) months following
the termination of his employment (the “Non-Solicitation Period”), neither Executive nor any
Executive-Controlled Person (as defined below) will, without the prior written consent of OXiGENE,
directly or indirectly solicit for employment, or make an unsolicited recommendation to any other
person that it employ or solicit for employment any person who is or was, at any time during the
one (1) year period prior to the termination date, an officer, Executive or key employee of OXiGENE
or any affiliate of OXiGENE. As used in this Agreement, the term “Executive-Controlled Person”
shall mean any company, partnership, firm or other entity as to which Executive possesses, directly
or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such
entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.



8.4 The provisions contained in this Section 8 as to the time periods, scope of activities,
persons or entities affected, and territories restricted shall be deemed divisible so that, if any
provision contained in this Section 8 is determined to be invalid or


















unenforceable, such provisions shall be deemed modified so as to be valid and
enforceable to the full extent lawfully permitted.




8.5 Executive agrees that the provisions of this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary for
the protection of OXiGENE and that they may not be adequately enforced by an action for damages and
that, in the event of a material breach thereof by Executive or any Executive-Controlled Person,
OXiGENE shall be entitled to apply for and obtain injunctive relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction to restrain the breach or threatened breach of such violation or otherwise to enforce
specifically such provisions against such violation, without the necessity of the posting of any
bond by OXiGENE. Executive further covenants under this Section 8, that OXiGENE shall be entitled
to an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, commissions, remuneration or other
benefits that Executive directly or indirectly has realized and/or may realize as a result of,
growing out of or in connection with any such violation. Such a remedy shall, however, be
cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any injunctive relief or other legal
equitable remedy to which OXiGENE is or may be entitled



9 Indemnification



OXiGENE, to the extent permitted by its Articles and By Laws, shall indemnify the Executive
for all claims, losses, expenses, costs, obligations, and liabilities of every nature whatsoever
incurred by the Executive to any third party as a result of the Executive’s acts or omissions as
an employee of OXiGENE, but excluding from such indemnification any claims, losses, expenses,
costs, obligations, or liabilities incurred by the Executive as a result of the Executive’s bad
faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence.



10 Attorney’s Fees and Expenses



OXiGENE and Executive agree that in the event of litigation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the other party to
the prevailing party’s reasonable attorney fees and expenses. Reimbursements under this Section 10 will be paid within sixty (60) days from the date it is
determined that Executive is entitled to payment under this Section 10.



11 Amendments



This Agreement may not be altered, modified or amended except by a written instrument
signed by each of the parties hereto.



12 Assignments



Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or
delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party; provided,
however, that any payments and benefits owed to Executive under this Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of his heirs and personal representatives.



















13 Waiver



Waiver by any party hereto of any breach or default by any other party of any of the terms
of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any other breach or default, whether similar
to or different from the breach or default waived.



14 Severability



In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be or become
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected thereby.



15  Notices



All notices and other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or when mailed by registered
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:


If to Executive:



If to OXiGENE:



OXiGENE, Inc.

701 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 210

South
San Francisco, CA 94080
Attn: John
Kollins or his successor



Or to such other address or such other person as Executive or OXiGENE shall designate in writing
in accordance with this Section 15, except that notices regarding changes in notices shall be
effective only upon receipt.




16 Headings



Headings to Sections in this Agreement are for the convenience of the parties only and are not
intended to be a part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement.



17 Governing Law; Venue; Jury Waiver



This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts without reference to the principles of conflict of laws. Each of the parties hereto
consents to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
in connection with any claim or controversy arising out of or connected with this Agreement, and
said courts shall be the exclusive fora for the resolution of any


















such claim or controversy. Service of process in any such proceeding may be made upon each of the
parties hereto at the address of such party as determined in accordance with Section 15 of this
Agreement, subject to the applicable rules of the court in which such action is brought. Both the
Executive and OXiGENE waive any right they may have to a trial by jury and agree that any dispute
between them arising from or relating to the Agreement or the Executive’s employment shall be tried
by a judge sitting without a jury.




18 All Other Agreements Superseded



Except for Executive’s Confidentiality and Inventions Agreement, which the Executive shall
sign as a condition of his employment and of the effectiveness of this Agreement, this Agreement
contains the entire agreement between Executive and OXiGENE with respect to all matters relating
to Executive’s employment with OXiGENE and, as of the date hereof, will supersede and replace
any other agreements, written or oral, between the parties relating to the terms or conditions
of Executive’s employment with OXiGENE.



19 Compliance with Code Section 409A



19.1 If any of the benefits set forth in this Agreement are deferred compensation under
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any successor statute, regulation
and guidance thereto (“Code Section 409A”), any termination of employment triggering payment of
such benefits must constitute a “separation from service” under Code Section 409A before
distribution of such benefits can commence. For purposes of clarification, this paragraph shall not
cause any forfeiture of benefits on the part of Executive, but shall only act as a delay until such
time as a “separation from service” occurs.



19.2 It is intended that each installment of the payments and benefits provided under this
Agreement shall be treated as a separate “payment” for purposes of Code Section 409A. Neither
OXiGENE nor Executive shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any such
payments or benefits except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Code Section
409A.



19.3 Any reimbursements or direct payment of Executive’s expenses subject to Code Section 409A
shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such
expense is incurred by the Executive. Any reimbursement or right to direct payment of Executive’s
expense in one calendar year shall not affect the amount that may be reimbursed or paid for in any
other calendar year and a reimbursement or payment of Executive’s expense (or right thereto) may
not be exchanged or liquidated for another benefit or payment.



19.4 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Agreement
shall be interpreted and at all times administered in a manner that avoids the inclusion of
compensation in income under Code Section 409A(a)(1). Any provision inconsistent with Code Section
409A will be read out of the Agreement. For purposes of clarification, this Section 19.4 shall be a
rule of construction and interpretation and




















nothing in this Section 19.4 shall cause a forfeiture of benefits on the part of the
Executive.




19.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
amount (including imputed income) to be paid to Executive pursuant to this Agreement as
a result of Executive’s termination of employment is “deferred compensation” subject to
Code Section 409A, and if Executive is a “Specified Employee” (as defined under Code
Section 409A) as of the date of Executive’s termination of employment hereunder, then,
to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of excise taxes or other penalties under
Code Section 409A, the payment of benefits, if any, scheduled to be paid by Company to
Executive hereunder during the first six (6) month period following the date of a
termination of employment hereunder shall not be paid until the date which is the first
business day after six (6) months have elapsed since Executive’s termination of
employment for any reason other than death. Any deferred compensation payments delayed
in accordance with the terms of this Section 19(e) shall be paid in a lump sum after six
(6) months have elapsed since Executive’s termination of employment. Any other payments
will be made according to the timing provided for herein.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, OXiGENE and Executive have caused this Agreement to be executed as
of the date first above written.

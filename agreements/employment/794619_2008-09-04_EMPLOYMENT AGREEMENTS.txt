ITEM 5.02 (e)   Compensatory
Arrangements






On August 21, 2008, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved new employment agreements to replace the previous employment agreements
for President and CEO Kent B. Guichard and Vice President and CFO Jonathan H.
Wolk.






The revisions to Mr. Guichard’s agreement were
made to clarify the definition of a “Change in Control period.” The revisions
to Mr. Wolk’s agreement were made to update his agreement for changes in Section 409A
of the IRS Code and to provide him with a tax gross-up in the event that he
is terminated in association with a Change in Control of the Company.






In addition, a new employment agreement was approved
by the Board for Mr. S. Cary Dunston, the Company’s Senior Vice President of
Manufacturing and Logistics, containing substantially the same terms and conditions as Mr.
Wolk’s new employment agreement.






These agreements were signed on September 2,
2008.  Copies of all three employment agreements are included as exhibits to this form
8-K.

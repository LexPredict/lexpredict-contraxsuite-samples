Item
5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;
Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain
Officers.



On June
18, 2009, Cyberonics, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into new employment
agreements with each of its executive officers, other than its Chief Executive
Officer (“CEO”).  The agreements are effective as of June 1, 2009,
concurrent with the expiration of the employment agreements of some of the
executive officers, and will expire on May 2, 2011, the date of expiration of
the CEO’s pre-existing employment agreement, a copy of which has been filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).




The form
of agreement used for each of the new employment agreements is included as
Exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated by reference into this Item
5.02.




In the
event that the Company terminates the executive officer without “Cause,” as
defined in the agreement, or the executive officer terminates employment for a
“Good Reason,” as defined in the agreement, then the executive officer is
entitled to the following benefits (the “Severance Benefits”):






·


a
payment equal to 1.5 times the sum of the executive officer’s annual base
salary and average bonus amount paid to the executive officer for the past
two fiscal years;











·


accelerated
vesting of time-based-vesting equity awards that would have vested in the
12 months succeeding the termination date had the executive officer
remained employed during that
period;











·


accelerated
vesting of performance-based-vesting restricted stock as determined by the
Compensation Committee in its sole discretion to represent the extent of
progress, if any, toward attainment of the performance criteria as of the
date of the executive officer’s
termination;











·


reimbursement
for the costs to obtain coverage under the Company’s group health plan
pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act for the executive
officer and his eligible dependents for a period of 12 months measured
from the termination date; and











·


waiver
of the requirement, if any, to repay relocation benefits as otherwise
required by the Company’s relocation
policy.








In the
event that, within one year following a “Change of Control,” as defined in the
agreement, either the Company terminates the executive officer’s employment
without Cause, or the executive officer terminates employment for a Good Reason,
then the executive officer is entitled to receive the Severance Benefits, except
that in lieu of the payment equal to 1.5 times the sum of the executive
officer’s annual base salary and average bonus amount for the past two fiscal
years, the payment equals two times the sum of the executive officer’s annual
base salary plus target bonus amount in effect on the date of
termination.




The
employment agreements replace the executive officers’ pre-existing Employment
Agreements, to the extent not already expired, and Severance Agreements, copies
of which are on file with the SEC.  The Severance Agreements provided
for a severance payment equal to three times the sum of the executive officer’s
annual base salary plus target bonus amount, as well as a gross-up payment for
any excise tax imposed thereon under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue
Code.




The
annual base salary as reflected in the employment agreement for each Named
Executive Officer is set forth in the table below.

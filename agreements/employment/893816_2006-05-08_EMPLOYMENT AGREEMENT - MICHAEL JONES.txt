ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

On May 4, 2006, the Company entered into an employment agreement (the
"Agreement") with Michael Jones, the Company's President - IT Outsourcing. Mr.
Jones has occupied this position since the Company acquired (i)Structure, LLC on
November 30, 2006. The initial term of the Agreement expires November 30, 2008
and it provides for renewals for successive one-year periods if no notice of
non-renewal is given by either party. The Agreement provides for compensation of
no less than $303,000 per year, subject to review annually, and the ability to
earn a bonus of up to 100% of the base salary then in effect each year based on
achieving certain performance criteria as determined by the Options and
Compensation Committee. If the Agreement is terminated by the Company without
"Cause", or by the executive without "Good Reason" (as those terms are defined
in the Agreement), the executive will receive severance in an amount of up to
twelve months of the executive's base salary at that time. The Agreement also
provides that Mr. Jones will receive a non-qualified option to purchase 75,000
shares of the Company's stock on November 30, 2006 and every twelve months
thereafter, for as long as Mr. Jones remains actively employed under the
Agreement. Mr. Jones had received an option to acquire 75,000 shares of the
Company's stock on December 1, 2005. All of Mr. Jones' options are subject to
the Company's 2005 Stock Plan.

A copy of the Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10 to this report and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Item.5.02


Entry
Into a Material Definitive
Agreement









On
December 27, 2007, DOR BioPharma, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into new
three-year employment agreements (“Employment Agreements”) with Christopher J.
Schaber, PhD, Evan Myrianthopoulos, and James Clavijo, CPA, the President and
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller,
respectively.  These agreements replace existing employment agreements
that were in force.




The
primary changes to the terms of the original agreements are as
follows:




As
previously disclosed, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the
issuance of the following number of shares to each of Dr. Schaber and Messrs.
Myrianthopoulos and Clavijo immediately prior to the completion of a
transaction, or series or a combination of related transactions, negotiated
by
the Company’s Board of Directors whereby, directly or indirectly, a majority of
the Company’s capital stock or a majority of its assets are transferred from the
Company and/or the Company’s stockholders to a third party:  1,000,000
common shares to Dr. Schaber, 750,000 common shares to Mr. Myrianthopoulos
and
300,000 common shares to Mr. Clavijo.  The amended agreements include
the Company’s obligation to issue such shares to the executives if such event
occurs.




Dr.
Schaber’s monetary compensation (base salary and bonus) remained unchanged from
2006.  He will be paid nine months severance upon termination of
employment. Upon a change in control of the Company due to merger or
acquisition, all of Dr. Schaber’s options shall become fully vested, and be
exercisable for a period of five years after such change in control (unless
they
would have expired sooner pursuant to their terms).  In the event of
his death during term of the agreement, all of his unvested options shall
immediately vest and remain exercisable for the rest of their term and become
the property of Dr. Schaber’s immediate family.




Mr.
Myrianthopoulos monetary compensation (base salary and bonus) remained unchanged
from 2006.  He will be paid six months severance upon termination of
employment. Upon a change in control of the Company due to merger or
acquisition, all of Mr. Myrianthopoulos’ options shall become fully vested, and
be exercisable for a period of three years after such change in control (unless
they would have expired sooner pursuant to their terms).  In the event
of his death during term of contract, all of his unvested options shall
immediately vest and remain exercisable for the rest of their term and become
property of Mr. Myrianthopoulos’ immediate family.




Mr.
Clavijo’s monetary compensation (base salary and bonus) remained unchanged from
2006.  He will be paid six months severance (subject to setoff) upon
termination of employment. Upon a change in control of the Company due to merger
or acquisition, all of Mr. Clavijo’s options shall become fully vested, and be
exercisable for a period of three years after such change in
control  (unless they would have expired sooner pursuant to their
terms).  In the event of his death during term of contract, all of his
unvested options shall immediately vest and remain exercisable for the rest
of
their term and become property of Mr. Clavijo’s immediate family.

Trade Secrets.  During Employee’s employment by the Company, Employee shall do what is reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized misappropriation or disclosure and threatened misappropriation or disclosure of the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries’ Trade Secrets and, after termination of employment, Employee shall not use or disclose the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries’ Trade Secrets as long as they remain, without misappropriation, Trade Secrets.




iv.

Copyright.  All copyrightable work by Employee relating to the Company’s or Parent’s business or the business of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company during the term of Employee’s employment by the Company is intended to be “work made for hire” as defined in Section 101 of the Copyright Act of 1976, and shall be the property of the Company.  If the copyright to any such copyrightable work is not the property of the Company by operation of law, Employee will, without further consideration, assign to the Company all right, title and interest in such copyrightable work and will assist the Company and its nominees in every way, at the Company’s expense, to secure, maintain and defend for the Company’s benefit, copyrights and any extensions and renewals thereof on any and all such work including translations thereof in any and all countries, such work to be and remain the property of the Company whether copyrighted or not.

b.

Non-Competition.




i.

During Employment.  During Employee’s employment hereunder, Employee shall not engage, directly or indirectly, as an employee, officer, director, partner, manager, consultant, agent, owner or in any other capacity, in any competition with the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries and agrees not to solicit any Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries business contact, including but not limited to, the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries’ customers, clients, vendors, employees, and independent contractors; provided, however, the Company and Employee agree that Employee is permitted to conduct business and compete in the civil aircraft industry, and that such conduct will not constitute a violation of the provisions of this Agreement.

d.

Return of Documents.  Immediately upon termination of employment, Employee will return to the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries, and so certify in writing to the Company, all the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries’ papers, documents and things, including information stored for use in or with computers and software applicable to the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries’ business (and all copies thereof), which are in Employee’s possession or under Employee’s control, regardless whether such papers, documents or things contain Confidential Information or Trade Secrets.




e.

No Conflicts.  To the extent that they exist, Employee will not disclose to the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries any of Employee’s previous employer’s confidential information or trade secrets.  Further, Employee represents and warrants that Employee has not previously assumed any obligations inconsistent with those of this Agreement and that employment by the Company does not conflict with any prior obligations to third parties.  In addition, Employee and the Company agree that it is important for any prospective employer to be aware of this Agreement, so that disputes concerning this Agreement can be avoided in the future.  Therefore, Employee agrees that, following termination of employment with the Company, the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries may forward a copy of this Agreement (and any related Exhibits hereto) to any future prospective or actual employer, and Employee releases the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries from any claimed liability or damage caused to Employee by virtue of the Company’s act in making that prospective or actual employer aware of of this Agreement (and any related Exhibits hereto).




f.

Agreement on Fairness.  Employee acknowledges that:  (i) this Agreement has been specifically bargained between the parties and reviewed by Employee; (ii) Employee has had an opportunity to obtain legal counsel to review this Agreement and has in fact obtained legal counsel to review this Agreement; and (iii) the covenants made by and duties imposed upon Employee hereby are fair, reasonable and minimally necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company, and such covenants and duties will not place an undue burden upon Employee’s livelihood in the event of termination of Employee’s employment by the Company and the strict enforcement of the covenants contained herein.




g.

Equitable Relief and Remedies.  Employee acknowledges that any breach of this Agreement will cause substantial and irreparable harm to the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries for which money damages would be an inadequate remedy.  Accordingly, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company or Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall in any such event be entitled to seek injunctive and other forms of equitable relief to prevent such breach and the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other, the prevailing party’s costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with enforcing this Agreement, in addition to any other rights or remedies available at law, in equity or by statute.



7.

INDEMNIFICATION FOR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Employee to the fullest extent permitted by law, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, penalties, judgments, awards, costs, expenses, and disbursements (and any and all actions, suits, proceedings and investigations in respect thereof and any and all legal and other costs, expenses and disbursements in giving testimony or furnishing documents in response to a subpoena or otherwise), including, without limitation, the costs, expenses, and disbursements, as and when incurred, of investigating, preparing, or defending any such action, suit, proceeding, or investigation (whether or not in connection with litigation in which Employee is a party), directly or indirectly, caused by, relating to, based upon, arising out of, or in connection with, Employee’s acting for the Company, including, without limitation, any act or omission by Employee in connection with his acceptance of or the performance or nonperformance of his duties and obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, such indemnification shall not apply to any portion of any such loss, claim, damage, obligation, penalty, judgment, award, liability, cost, expense, or disbursement to the extent it is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal) to have resulted primarily and directly from the negligence or willful misconduct of Employee.




If any action, suit, proceeding, or investigation is commenced, as to which Employee proposes to demand indemnification, he shall notify the Company with reasonable promptness.  The Company shall retain counsel of its own choice to represent him, and the Company shall pay the fees, expenses, and disbursements of such counsel, and such counsel shall, to the extent consistent with its professional responsibilities, cooperate with the Company and any counsel designated by the Company.  The Company shall be liable for any settlement of any claim against Employee.  The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Employee, settle or compromise any claim, or permit a default or consent to the entry of any judgment in respect thereof, unless such settlement, compromise, or consent includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the claimant to Employee of an unconditional and irrevocable release from all liability in respect of such claim.




Neither termination nor completion of the employment of Employee shall affect these Indemnification Provisions which shall then remain operative and in full force and effect.

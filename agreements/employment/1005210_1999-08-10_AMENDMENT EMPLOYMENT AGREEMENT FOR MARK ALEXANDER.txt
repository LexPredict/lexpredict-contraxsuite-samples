EXHIBIT 10.(c)

SECOND AMENDMENT

The Employment  Agreement dated March 5, 1996, and the First  Amendment  thereto
dated October 23, 1997, between Mark A. Alexander (the "Executive") and Suburban
Propane, L.P. (the "Partnership")  (collectively the "Employment Agreement") are
hereby modified and amended this 14th day of April, 1999, as follows:

RECITALS

WHEREAS,          Suburban Propane Partners,  L.P.,  the sole limited partner of
the Partnership ("Suburban"), has entered into an Amended  and
Restated Recapitalization Agreement dated as of March 15, 1999
(the "Recapitalization Agreement") with the  Partnership,  the
general  partner  of  the  Partnership  and  of  Suburban (the
"General Partner"),  the General Partner's parent and Suburban
Energy Services Group LLC, a new entity in which the Executive
will hold equity interests (the "LLC"); and

WHEREAS,          pursuant  to  the  Recapitalization   Agreement,  among  other
things,  the LLC will purchase from the General Partner all of
the general  partner  interests held by the General Partner in
the  Partnership  and Suburban and the LLC will become the new
general partner of Suburban (the "Substitution  Transaction");
and

WHEREAS,          the Substitution Transaction constitutes a "Change of Control"
for purposes of section 6.1 of the Employment Agreement; and

WHEREAS,          the Executive entered into a letter agreement  dated  December
18, 1998 (the "Letter  Agreement") under  which the  Executive
agreed  (i)  to  waive  certain  rights  under  the Employment
Agreement that would become exercisable  upon the consummation
of the Substitution Transaction insofar  as it  constitutes  a
"Change of Control"  and  (ii) to  modify  the  definition  of
"Change  of  Control" in the  Employment  Agreement to exclude
therefrom any sale or transfer of the General Partner interest
that might occur  after the  consummation  of the Substitution
Transaction; and

WHEREAS,          the  Partnership  and the  Executive  wish to enter  into this
Second Amendment to amend the Employment Agreement as provided
in the Letter  Agreement  and to  replace  and  supersede  the
Letter  Agreement in all respects,  upon the terms and subject
to the conditions herein.



NOW THEREFORE,  In consideration of foregoing recitals, the terms and conditions
of this Second Amendment,  the  Partnership's  payment of one dollar ($1) to the
Executive,  and  other  valuable  consideration,  receipt  of which  are  hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

1.       RECITALS.  The foregoing recitals are incorporated into this  Amendment
by  reference,  as if  fully  set forth  herein at length, and shall be
considered terms of the Amendment.

2.       WAIVER OF RIGHTS EXERCISED ON SUBSTITUTION  TRANSACTION.  The Executive
hereby waives his right  to receive  any payments  described in section
6.1(a) of the Employment Agreement that would otherwise become  payable
if he were to  terminate  his  employment under such section other than
with "Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreement)  during the
six-month period commencing on the six-month anniversary of the date of
the Substitution Transaction.  Nothing in this section 2 is intended or
shall be construed to limit in any manner the right of the Executive to
terminate his  employment  other  than  with  Good  Reason  during such
six-month period and any other right that the  Executive  may have with

<PAGE>

respect to a termination of his employment under such section 6.1(a) by
the  Partnership  without  Cause or  by the  Executive with Good Reason
following the consummation of the Substitution Transaction.

3.       AMENDMENT OF  DEFINITION  OF CHANGE OF CONTROL.  The parties agree that
upon the completion of the Recapitalization,  the definition of "Change
of Control"  set forth in section  6.5(c) of the  Employment  Agreement
shall be amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

"CHANGE OF CONTROL"  means  the  occurrence  during the Employment
Term of:

(i)  an acquisition  (other than directly from the MLP) of
Common Units or voting  equity  interests of the  MLP
("VOTING SECURITIES") by any "PERSON" (as the term is
used for  purposes  of Section  13(d) or 14(d) of the
Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as amended (the
"EXCHANGE ACT")), other than the MLP, Suburban Energy
Services  Group  LLC  or  any  of  their  affiliates,
immediately  after which such Person has  "BENEFICIAL
OWNERSHIP"   (within   the   meaning  of  Rule  13d-3
promulgated  under  the  Exchange  Act) of more  than
twenty  five  percent  (25%) of the  combined  voting
power of the MLP's then outstanding Units;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that in  determining  whether  a Change  of
Control has  occurred,  Units which are acquired in a
`Non-Control  Acquisition'  (as hereinafter  defined)
shall not constitute an acquisition which would cause
a Change  of  Control.  A  "NON-CONTROL  ACQUISITION"
shall mean an acquisition by (i) an employee  benefit
plan (or a trust forming a part  thereof)  maintained
by  (A)  the  MLP  or  the  Partnership  or  (B)  any
corporation,  partnership  or other Person of which a
majority  of its voting  power or its  voting  equity
securities or equity  interest is owned,  directly or
indirectly,  by the MLP  (for  the  purposes  of this
definition,  a  "SUBSIDIARY"),  (ii)  the  MLP or its
Subsidiaries,  or (iii) any Person in connection with
a "NON-CONTROL TRANSACTION" (as hereinafter defined);
or

(ii) approval by the partners  of the MLP of (A) a merger,
consolidation or  reorganization  involving  the MLP,
unless  (x) the  holders of Units immediately  before
such  merger, consolidation  or  reorganization  own,
directly  or  indirectly  immediately  following such
merger,  consolidation  or  reorganization,  at least
sixty percent (60%) of the combined  voting  power of
the  outstanding  Units of the entity  resulting from
such  merger,  consolidation or  reorganization  (the
"SURVIVING   ENTITY")   in  substantially   the  same
proportion   as   their   ownership   of   the  Units
immediately  before  such  merger,  consolidation  or
reorganization,  and  (y) no person or entity  (other
than the MLP, any Subsidiary,  any  employee  benefit
plan (or any trust forming a part thereof) maintained
by the MLP, the Partnership, the Surviving Entity, or
any Person who,  immediately  prior  to such  merger,
consolidation  or   reorganization   had   Beneficial
Ownership of  more than  twenty five percent (25%) of
the then outstanding Units), has Beneficial Ownership
of  more  than  twenty  five  percent  (25%)  of  the
combined  voting power of the Surviving Entity's then
outstanding   voting   securities;   (B)  a  complete
liquidation  or  dissolution  of  the MLP; or (C) the
sale or other  disposition of fifty percent (50%)  or

<PAGE>

more  of the  net assets  of the  MLP to  any  Person
(other   than   a   transfer  to  a  Subsidiary).   A
transaction   described  in  clause  (x)  or  (y)  of
subsection  (a)  hereof  shall  be  referred  to as a
"NON-CONTROL TRANSACTION".

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  a Change of Control
shall  not be  deemed  to occur  solely  because  any
Person (the  "SUBJECT  PERSON")  acquired  Beneficial
Ownership  of more than the  permitted  amount of the
outstanding  Voting  Securities  as a  result  of the
acquisition of Voting Securities by the MLP which, by
reducing the number of Voting Securities outstanding,
increases   the   proportional    number   of   units
Beneficially  Owned by the Subject  Person,  provided
that if a Change of Control  would occur (but for the
operation  of  this  sentence)  as a  result  of  the
acquisition of the Voting  Securities by the MLP, and
after such  acquisition  of Voting  Securities by the
MLP, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial  Owner
of any additional  Voting  Securities which increases
the  percentage  of  the  then   outstanding   Voting
Securities  Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person,
than a Change of Control shall occur.

4.       CONTINUED FORCE AND EFFECT OF EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT.  The Parties agree
that the terms and  conditions of the  Employment  Agreement  remain in
full force and effect except as amended herein.

5.       SECTION  HEADINGS.  The section headings utilized in this Amendment are
only to be used for reference and organization. The headings are not to
be considered  terms of this Amendment nor should they be utilized when
interpreting the terms and conditions of this Amendment.



IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the  Parties  hereto  have  caused  this  three  (3) page
Amendment,  inclusive  of this  signature  page,  to be duly  executed as of the
effective date noted above.


Mark A. Alexander                           Suburban Propane, L.P.

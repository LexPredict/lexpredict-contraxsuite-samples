Re: Modification of Employment Agreement



Dear Ms. Meyrowitz:




Reference is made to the Employment Agreement dated as of October 17, 2005 (the “Agreement”)
between you and The TJX Companies, Inc. (the “Company”). The Company proposes to amend Section 3(a)
of the Agreement (“Base Salary”) by adding at the end thereof the following text: “Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, however, effective for periods commencing on or after
March 13, 2006 the preceding provisions of this Section 3(a) shall be applied by substituting
$990,000.00 for $1,100,000.00.”



If you agree with the foregoing proposed amendment to the Agreement, please so indicate by
signing the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to Mr. Paul Kangas, whereupon the
Agreement will be deemed amended, effective immediately, to incorporate the change set forth above,
and, except as to amended, the Agreement will continue in effect in accordance with its terms.
This letter agreement shall constitute an agreement under seal.

1. DEFINED TERMS. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.

replace "2002" with "2005", thereby causing the Expiration Date to be defined as

3. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 3(e). Section 3(e) of the Agreement is deleted
in its entirety and replaced with the following:

"(e) ANNUAL PERFORMANCE BONUS UNDER EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE

the Executive shall be paid a bonus (the "EPIP Bonus") under the
Parent Company's Executive Performance Incentive Plan (the "EPIP")
having a "Performance Target" equal to $2,500,000 based upon his
performance against objectives determined in accordance with the EPIP.
The compensation committee of the Parent Company's board of directors

You recognize that, by reason of your employment hereunder, you may acquire confidential information and trade secrets concerning the operation of the Group and of the clients of the Group, the use or disclosure of which could cause the Group substantial loss and damages that could not be readily calculated and for which no remedy under applicable law would be adequate.

Therefore, in the event of such a breach or threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to obtain a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining you from engaging in activities prohibited by Paragraph 6 or such other relief as may be required specifically to enforce any of the covenants in such Paragraph. You agree to reimburse and indemnify the Company for all legal fees and costs.

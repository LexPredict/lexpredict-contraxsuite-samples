to be treated as being corrected on January 1, 2009.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

1. Section 4(d) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended to read as follows:

“(d) Termination without Cause. The Company may terminate Batiz’s employment hereunder at any time

to read as follows:
“Under such circumstances, Batiz shall be entitled to (x) the severance benefits set forth in
Section 4(d) and paid at the time provided therein, subject to the timing rules of Section 11 and (y) any benefits granted him in the Company’s Equity Plan.”

3. A new Section 11 is hereby added to the Employment Agreement to read as follows:

“11. Section 409A.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any provision hereof would result in the imposition of
an additional tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the ‘Code’) and related regulations and Treasury pronouncements (‘Section 409A’), that provision will be reformed to avoid imposition of
the applicable tax to the extent permissible under Section 409A and no action so taken shall be deemed to adversely affect Batiz’s rights under this Agreement. The benefits under this Agreement are intended to be exempt from or in
compliance with the requirements of Section 409A, and this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with such intent.

(b) Each payment under this Agreement, including each payment in a series of installment payments, is intended to be a
separate payment for purposes of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-2(b), and is intended to be: (i) exempt from Section 409A, including, but not limited to, by compliance with the short-term deferral exemption as specified in Treas. Reg. §
1.409A-1(b)(4), or (ii) in compliance with Section 409A, including, but not limited to, being paid pursuant to a fixed schedule or specified date pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-3(a) and the provisions of this Agreement will be
administered, interpreted and construed accordingly.
(c) All reimbursements or provision of in-kind benefits
pursuant to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) such that the reimbursement or provision will be deemed payable at a specified time or on a fixed schedule relative to a permissible payment event.
Specifically, the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before the last day of Batiz’s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Batiz and the Company agree that any benefit or
benefits under this Agreement or any other agreement or arrangement that provides for deferred compensation subject to Section 409A payable upon Batiz’s separation from service with the Company that are subject to the
six-

Batiz’s separation from service, (ii) the date of Batiz’s death, or (iii) such earlier date as complies with the requirements of Section 409A, provided that in no event shall any such delayed payment be made prior to

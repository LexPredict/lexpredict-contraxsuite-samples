to

Employment Agreement

This Amendment No. 1 to the Employment  Agreement (the "Agreement")  dated as of
December  13,  2002  ("Agreement  Date")  by and  between  Financial  Industries
Corporation,  a Texas  company  ("Company"),  and George Wise  ("Executive"),  a
resident of Texas.  The parties  desire to enter into this  Amendment,  which is
intended  to  modify  certain  terms  and   conditions  of  the  Agreement.   In
consideration  of the  mutual  agreements  contained  herein,  the  Company  and
Executive agree as follows:

1.   Section 3.1 of the  Agreement is hereby  amended in its entirety to read as
follows:

3.1  Employment Period. The term of Executive's  employment under this
Agreement (the "Employment  Period") shall begin on the Agreement
Date and end on March 31, 2004.  The Company  reserves the right,
at its sole option,  to establish an earlier date between January
1, 2004 and March 31, 2004 as the ending  date of the  Employment
Period.  Executive  shall be  entitled to receive the payment set
forth in paragraph 6 of this  Amendment  No. 1 to the  Employment
Agreement.

2.   The parties  acknowledge that Executive received a letter dated December 3,
2003,  whereby  Executive  was assigned to the position of Chief Actuary of
the  Company,  reporting  to the Chief  Executive  Officer of the  Company,
effective  January 15, 2004.  The parties  agree that said letter is hereby
rescinded.

3.   Effective  January 1, 2004,  Section 2.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended
in its entirety to read as follows:

2.1  Duties.  Company  shall employ  Executive  during the  Employment
Period as the Chief Financial  Officer,  and Executive shall have
the authority,  duties, and  responsibilities as are commensurate
and consistent with such position and title,  and as provided in,
Company's by-laws. During the Employment Period,  Executive shall
follow the lawful directives of the CEO which are consistent with
stated Board  policy.  During the  Employment  Period,  Executive
shall  perform the duties  assigned to him,  and shall devote his
full business time,  attention and effort,  excluding any periods
of  disability,  vacation,  or sick leave to which  Executive  is
entitled,  to the  affairs of the  Company and shall use his best
efforts  to  promote  the  interests  of the  Company;  provided,
however, that, on and after January 1, 2004, Executive may devote
up to  one  day  per  week  to the  business  of  Actuarial  Risk
Consultants,  Inc. ("ARC"),  which business  Executive  purchased
from an affiliate of the Company as of December 31, 2003.  Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, Executive shall not engage
in  any  other  business  or  commercial   activity  for  profit,
including  service on the board of directors  of any  corporation
other than the Company,  without the prior written consent of the



<PAGE>


CEO. The preceding  sentence is not intended to prevent Executive
from acting as a passive  investor in any business which does not
involve  the  personal   efforts  of  Executive.   The  Executive
acknowledges  that his  business  time is not  limited to a fixed
number of hours per  week.  Executive  agrees  that  neither  the
modification of his duties nor the close supervision of Executive
by the Audit  Committee  of the Board of Directors of the Company
constitutes "Good Reason",  within the meaning of Section 1.21 of
the Agreement;

4.   Effective  January 1, 2004,  Section 4.1 is amended in its entirety to read
as follows:

4.1  Salary. Executive shall be paid in accordance with normal payroll
practices  (but not less  frequently  than  monthly) at an annual
rate of $152,000.00 per year.

5.   Section 4.2 is hereby deleted in its entirety.

6.   Article  IV  -Compensation  is  amended by the  addition  of the  following
section:

4.2  Severance  Payment.  In connection with the early  termination of
the Employment Period,  Company will pay to Executive a severance
payment in the amount of $310,000, one-half of which will be paid
on January 1, 2004 and the  balance to be paid on the last day of
the  Employment  Period.  The Company  will deduct from each such
installment  any  applicable  deductions for federal income taxes
and other related payroll taxes.

7.   Section 7.1 is amended so as to substitute  the phrase "March 31, 2004" for
the phrase the second  anniversary of the Date of Termination  (whether or
not during the Term" in the second line of said Section  7.1.  Accordingly,
Section 7.1, as amended, reads as follows:

7.1  Non-Competition.  Executive  shall  not at any  time  during  the
period  beginning on the  Agreement  Date and ending on March 31,
2004, directly or indirectly, in any capacity:

(a)  engage or  participate  in,  become  employed by, serve as a
director  of,  or render  advisory  or  consulting  or other
services  in  connection  with,  any  Competitive  Business;
provided,  however,  that after the Date of Termination this
Section  7.1(a) shall not preclude  Executive  from being an
employee  of,  or  consultant  to,  any  business  unit of a
Competitive  Business  if (i) such  business  unit  does not
qualify as a Competitive  Business in its own right and (ii)
Executive  does not have any direct or indirect  involvement
in,  or   responsibility   for,  any   operations   of  such
Competitive   Business   that  cause  it  to  qualify  as  a
Competitive Business; or



<PAGE>


(b)  make or retain any financial investment, whether in the form
of equity or debt, or own any interest,  in any  Competitive
Business; provided, however, that nothing in this subsection
shall  restrict  Executive  from making an investment in any
Competitive  Business if such  investment  (i) represents no
more  than  1%  of  the   aggregate   market  value  of  the
outstanding  capital stock or debt (as  applicable)  of such
Competitive Business, (ii) does not give Executive any right
or ability,  directly or indirectly, to control or influence
the  policy  decisions  or  management  of such  Competitive
Business,  and (iii) does not create a conflict  of interest
between  Executive's  duties  under this  Agreement  and his
interest in such investment.

8.   (a)  In consideration  of  the  obligations  of   the  Company   hereunder,
Executive  hereby  releases  and  forever  discharges  the persons and
organizations  specified in Section 6(b),  below,  with respect to the
matters  described  in Section 6( c ), below.  Executive  acknowledges
that the consideration is in addition to anything of value to which he
is already  entitled.  Executive agrees that this release is on behalf
of   himself,   his   heirs,    executors,    administrators,    legal
representatives, successors and assigns.

(b)  Executive  releases the Company,  any parent,  subsidiary or otherwise
affiliated  companies,  successors and assigns, and all of their past,
present  and  future  officers,  directors,  agents,   administrators,
trustees, attorneys, insurers, successors and employees. Collectively,
these  persons  and  organizations  are  intended  to be  third  party
beneficiaries  of this agreement and are referred to in this Agreement
as "the Released Parties."

(c)  Executive  releases the  Released  Parties from all  existing,  known,  and
unknown claims, demands, and causes of action for all existing,  known, and
unknown damages and remedies of any nature, which have accrued or which may
ever  accrue,  to  me  or to my  heirs,  executors,  administrators,  legal
representatives,  successors,  or assigns. This release includes but is not
limited to (i) all claims under any federal, state, or local employment law

201, et. seq., the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended (except
any claims  arising after the date of this  agreement),  29 U.S.C.  Section
621, et seq., the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act, as amended,  29
U.S.C. Section 1001, et seq., and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act,

Executive could assert  pertaining to the matters  described in a purported

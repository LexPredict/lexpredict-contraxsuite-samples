Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement








On March 31, 2006, ScanSource, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Amendment to Employment Agreement (the "Amendment") with Steven H. Owings, Chairman of the Board of Directors.  The Amendment amends the Employment Agreement between the Company and Mr. Owings originally dated October 18, 2002 and amended and restated as of March 11, 2005 (the "Employment Agreement").Pursuant to the Amendment, certain changes were made to the Employment Agreement, effective as of March 31, 2006, to eliminate the provision of post-termination medical benefits to Mr. Owings and his dependents.
Prior to the Amendment, the Employment Agreement provided that if Mr. Owings' employment with the Company was terminated during the employment period for any reason other than by the Company for Cause or by Mr. Owings without Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreement), Mr. Owings and his dependents would be entitled to receive medical, dental and prescription drug benefits until Mr. Owings reached the age of
65, and MediGap coverage, to the extent available, until Mr. Owings reached the age of 80, which would have consisted of ongoing coverage under policies that cover medical expenses for Mr. Owings and his dependents in excess of that covered by Medicare, subject to certain limitations.  In the event Mr. Owings' employment with the Company terminated due to his death, such benefits would have continued with respect to Mr. Owings's spouse and children for certain specified periods.
As a result of the Amendment, all terms in the Employment Agreement related to the provision of post-termination medical benefits described above have been deleted.

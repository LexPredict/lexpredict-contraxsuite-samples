Item
5.02  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of
Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of
Certain
Officers






On
July
16, 2007, Horizon Bancorp (the “Company”) and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Horizon Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), entered into an
employment agreement with Thomas H. Edwards. The agreement provides that
Mr.
Edwards will continue to serve as the Company’s Executive Vice President and the
Bank’s President and Chief Operating Officer for a term of three years. The term
of the agreement will be extended for an additional one-year period beyond
the
then-effective expiration date on each annual anniversary of the date of
the
agreement until the year in which Mr. Edwards reaches the age of sixty-three,
unless the Company delivers notice to Mr. Edwards within sixty days prior
to the
expiration of any one-year period that the term will not be
extended.  Mr. Edwards currently is fifty-four years
old.





The
agreement also provides that Mr. Edwards will continue to receive an annual
base
salary equal to the amount being paid to him on the date of the agreement,
subject to adjustment based on the annual review of the Company’s Board of
Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, but the
adjusted base salary amount may not be less than Mr. Edwards’s base salary on
the date of the agreement. Mr. Edwards’s base salary for fiscal 2007 is
$179,220.



The
Company may terminate Mr. Edwards’s employment immediately for “cause” as
defined in the agreement. The Company also may terminate Mr. Edwards’s
employment without cause upon not less than thirty days’ prior notice. Mr.
Edwards may terminate his employment immediately for “good reason” as defined in
the agreement or upon not less than thirty days’ prior notice without good
reason.




If
the
Company terminates Mr. Edwards’s employment without cause or if Mr. Edwards
terminates his employment with good reason, the agreement provides for the
Company to pay Mr. Edwards an amount equal to his then-current annual base
salary plus an amount equal to the average of his bonuses for the previous
two
calendar years. The agreement also provides for Mr. Edwards to receive health
and certain other benefits for a one-year period, subject to certain
limitations. The agreement also includes provisions protecting the Company’s and
the Bank’s confidential business information and from competition by Mr.
Edwards.



If
Mr.
Edwards’s employment is terminated upon a change in control of the Company, the
agreement provides for the Company to pay Mr. Edwards an amount equal to
twice
his then-current annual base salary plus an amount equal to the average of
his
bonuses for the previous two calendar years.  In addition, the
agreement provides for Mr. Edwards to receive health and certain other benefits
for a one-year period, subject to certain limitations.





The
employment agreement supersedes, cancels and replaces the change-of-control
agreement, dated October 7, 1999, between the Bank and Mr. Edwards.



The
employment agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on
Form
8-K.

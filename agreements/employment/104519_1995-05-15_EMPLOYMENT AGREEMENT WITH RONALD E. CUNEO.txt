Mr. Ronald E. Cuneo
1157 Old Gate Court
McLean, Virginia  22102

Dear Mr. Cuneo:

This letter sets forth the details of your employment with Wang
Laboratories, Inc., ("Wang" or the "Company") and supersedes and cancels any
prior employment agreements and/or arrangements you may have entered into with
Wang and/or with HFS Inc. ("HFSI"), except for the Employment Termination,
Severance Payments and Mutual Release letter agreement signed by you, and HFSI
dated March 23, 1995, (the "Mutual Release").  The Company agrees to employ
you, and you agree to remain in the employ of the Company, upon the following
terms and conditions.

1.      POSITION

You are to be employed as a Senior Vice President of Wang and as
President of Wang's federal systems business, whether operated through HFSI,
Wang's FSD division or otherwise.  You will be a member of the Senior
Operations Committee of the Company.

2.      TERM

The terms and conditions of this letter will cover a three (3)-year
period beginning April 1, 1995, unless otherwise terminated as provided in
paragraph 4, below, and will provide you with eighteen (18) months of severance
benefits if your employment with the Company is terminated at any time during
such three (3)-year period as described in paragraph 4, below. At the end of
this three (3)-year period, your employment status will be at-will, meaning
that your employment at Wang will be for an indefinite period of time and will
be terminable at any time, with or without cause being shown, by either you or
the Company.  Therefore, the terms and conditions contained in paragraph 4 of
this letter will expire at the end of this three (3)-year period and the
original, unmodified terms of paragraph 6 of the enclosed attached, presently
modified Employment Agreement, will be in full force and effect.  All other
terms and conditions of this letter will remain in effect after the three
(3)-year period, subject to Wang's right to review them and make adjustments as
appropriate.  All terms and conditions of this letter are contingent upon your
not rescinding any aspect of the Mutual Release.

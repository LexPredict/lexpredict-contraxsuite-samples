Dear Mike:

As you know, it is proposed that RadiSys Corporation (RadiSys) will enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among RadiSys Corporation,
Continuous Computing Corporation (CCPU) and RadiSys Holdings, Inc. (Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), CCPU will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of RadiSys Corporation.
We are extremely pleased to offer you the position of Chief Executive Officer, and a member of our Board of Directors of RadiSys Corporation following the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement). You will be reporting to the Board of Directors
of RadiSys and I, as Chairman of the Board of RadiSys Corporation will be working closely with you. Your position will be a 16B Officer of RadiSys and based at our Hillsboro, Oregon location.
The terms of this offer letter will become effective at the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and will be of no force or effect prior to such time, or in the event the Merger Agreement
is terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger or in the event this offer letter, the Severance Agreement, or the Change of Control Agreement (as such terms are defined below) are not approved by our Board of Directors and Compensation
Committee prior to the Effective Time.
Your initial annualized total target compensation will be $810,000, which is made up of two main
components: a base salary and an incentive compensation plan.
Your initial base salary will be $14,807.69 on a biweekly basis, less
reductions required by law, which would be $385,000 annualized. Your initial annual Executive Incentive Plan (Plan) target is $425,000 annually at 100% of Plan payout.
Payouts from the Plan are contingent upon the achievement of corporate performance results against RadiSys’ annual operating plan, and your own performance against annual objectives. Payouts from the
Plan are distributed semiannually, generally in February and in August, in accordance with Plan rules. The actual amount paid out from the Plan will vary depending upon the level of corporate performance results and performance to your annual
objectives. You will be eligible to participate for the partial-year period in which you start work, on a pro-rated basis, and you must be an active employee in good standing on the date the bonus is paid to be eligible for Plan payout.

Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, we will provide you with a written severance agreement
which includes provision for twenty-four months of base salary and twelve months company-paid COBRA coverage in case of an involuntary separation of employment other than for cause in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (Severance
Agreement). We will also provide you with a written change of control agreement which includes provisions for twenty-four months of base salary as severance and vesting of any outstanding equity awards in the case of an involuntary separation of
employment other than for cause within twelve months following a change of control or within three months preceding a change of control in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (Change of Control Agreement). Payment of any of these
amounts under the Severance Agreement or Change of Control Agreement will be contingent upon your signing of a release agreement. The terms of these agreements will be defined and documented in separate agreements upon your acceptance of the offer
and upon approval by our Board of Directors.
In consideration for the amounts you will receive in connection with the proposed merger between
RadiSys Holdings, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of RadiSys Corporation) and CCPU, your current employer, and by signing below, you hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) you understand and have had sufficient opportunity to discuss with
RadiSys your duties and responsibilities and initial compensation which will apply to your employment with RadiSys and (ii) the transition from your current position of employment with CCPU to your new position of employment with RadiSys will
not constitute Good Reason for you to terminate your employment under the terms of any employment agreement between you and CCPU, nor will it constitute a termination without Cause by CCPU. Further, you agree to waive any entitlement to severance
under any CCPU plan, policy, agreement or practice that existed at any time before the closing of the proposed merger and that such waiver shall inure to the benefit of RadiSys, its successors and assigns, and any third parties, including CCPU.

Upon commencement of employment with RadiSys and subject to approval of our Board of Directors, you will be granted
70,000 stock options. The exercise price of your stock options will be the closing price of the shares on the NASDAQ on the grant date. Your stock options will be exercisable for 1/3 of the total number of option shares on the first anniversary of
the grant date. Thereafter, they will become exercisable for 1/36th of the total number of option shares per month during the term of your employment, with the options fully vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. The options may be exercised at any time after
they become exercisable and until the options expire on the seventh anniversary of the grant date. You will also be eligible to receive, upon commencement of employment with RadiSys and subject to approval by our Board of Directors, a grant of
30,000 restricted stock units (RSUs). Each RSU is the equivalent of one share of our common stock. During the term of your employment, 1/3 of the total RSUs will vest at the completion of one year following the date of grant; an additional 1/3 of
the total RSUs will vest at the completion of two years following the date of grant; and the remaining 1/3 of the total RSUs will vest at the completion of three years following the date of grant. Upon vesting, the RSUs will have immediate value
based on the then current trading price of RadiSys common stock. Specific details regarding your stock option and RSU grants will be provided shortly after you begin employment with RadiSys.

You will also participate in the RadiSys Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Subject to approval of our
Board of Directors, you are currently targeted to be awarded up to 135,000 restricted shares that will vest upon the achievement of the applicable performance measures under the LTIP.

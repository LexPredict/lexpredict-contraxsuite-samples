To the extent that the vesting of all or some of your

sentence, is not permitted under Section 7.3 of the
ATMI, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan (the "2003 Plan") or a
comparable provision of any other plan under which
such shares are granted, such shares shall not vest.
In lieu thereof, the Company will pay you within ten
(10) days after your termination of employment an
amount in cash equal to the fair market value as of
the date of your termination of employment of those
restricted shares that do not vest, determined
pursuant to Section 6.1(c) of the 2003 Plan or a
comparable provision of any other plan under which
such shares are granted.

The Employment Agreement, as amended, remains in full force and effect.

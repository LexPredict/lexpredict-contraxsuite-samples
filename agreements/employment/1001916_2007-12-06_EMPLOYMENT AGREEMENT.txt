Company has received and in the future will receive from third parties their confidential or proprietary information subject to a duty on the Company’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain
limited purposes. I agree to hold all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to any person, firm or corporation or to use it except as necessary in carrying out my work for the Company
consistent with the Company’s agreement with such third party.
3. Conflicting Employment. I agree that, during the term of my
employment with the Company, I will not engage in any other employment, occupation, consulting or other business activity directly related to the business in which the Company is now involved or becomes involved during the term of my employment, nor

4. Returning Company Documents. I agree that, at the
time of leaving the employ of the Company, I will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in my possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications,
drawings blueprints, sketches, materials, equipment, other documents or property, or reproductions of any aforementioned items developed by me pursuant to my employment with the Company or otherwise belonging to the Company, its successors or

5. Notification of New Employer. In the event that I leave the employ of the Company, I hereby grant
consent to notification by the Company to my new employer about my rights and obligations under this Agreement.
6. Solicitation of
Employees. To the full extent permitted by law, for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of my relationship with the Company for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, I shall not, by myself or in
collaboration with others, either directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of the Company’s employees to leave their employment, or take away such employees, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away
employees of the Company, either for myself or any other person or entity.
7. Representations. I agree to execute any proper oath or verify
any proper document required to carry out the terms of this Agreement. I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information acquired by me in confidence or in
trust prior to my employment by the Company. I have not entered into, and I agree I will not enter into, any oral or written agreement in conflict herewith.
8. Arbitration and Equitable Relief.
(a) Arbitration. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 8(b) BELOW, I
AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONCERNING ANY INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION TO BE HELD IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION RULES THEN IN EFFECT OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY GRANT INJUNCTIONS OR OTHER RELIEF IN SUCH DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY. THE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE FINAL, CONCLUSIVE AND
BINDING ON THE PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION. JUDGMENT MAY BE ENTERED ON THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION. THE COMPANY SHALL PAY THE COSTS AND EXPENSES OF SUCH ARBITRATION, AND EACH OF US SHALL SEPARATELY PAY OUR COUNSEL
FEES AND EXPENSES.
THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF EMPLOYEE’S RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND RELATES TO THE RESOLUTION OF
ALL DISPUTES RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP (EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 8(b) BELOW), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS:
i. ANY AND ALL CLAIMS FOR WRONGFUL DISCHARGE OF EMPLOYMENT; BREACH OF CONTRACT, BOTH EXPRESS AND IMPLIED; BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, BOTH EXPRESS AND IMPLIED; NEGLIGENT OR INTENTIONAL
INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS; NEGLIGENT OR INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION; NEGLIGENT OR INTENTIONAL INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT OR PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE; AND DEFAMATION;
ii. ANY AND ALL CLAIMS FOR VIOLATION OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR MUNICIPAL STATUTE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF
1964, THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1991, THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1967, THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990, THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT, THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT, AND LABOR CODE SECTION 201, et
seq.;
iii. ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ANY OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT OR EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION.

(b) Equitable Remedies. I AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR INADEQUATE TO MEASURE AND CALCULATE THE COMPANY’S
DAMAGES FROM ANY BREACH OF THE COVENANTS SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 2 AND 4 HEREIN. ACCORDINGLY, I AGREE THAT IF I BREACH ANY OF SUCH SECTIONS, THE COMPANY WILL HAVE AVAILABLE, IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY AVAILABLE, THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN
AN INJUNCTION FROM A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION RESTRAINING SUCH BREACH OR THREATENED BREACH AND TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF ANY SUCH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT. I FURTHER AGREE THAT NO BOND OR OTHER SECURITY SHALL BE REQUIRED IN OBTAINING SUCH
EQUITABLE RELIEF AND I HEREBY CONSENT TO THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH INJUNCTION AND TO THE ORDERING OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.
(c)
Consideration. I UNDERSTAND THAT EACH PARTY’S PROMISE TO RESOLVE CLAIMS BY









ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, RATHER THAN THROUGH THE COURTS, IS CONSIDERATION FOR OTHER PARTY’S LIKE PROMISE. I
FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT I AM OFFERED EMPLOYMENT IN CONSIDERATION OF MY PROMISE TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS.
9. General Provisions.

subsequent change or changes in my duties, salary or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement.
(c)

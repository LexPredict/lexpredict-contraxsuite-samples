Items to be Included in this Report











Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement








As of December 22, 2004, the Company entered into an employment agreement with George Jankovic, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, with an initial salary of $225,000 per annum. The agreement has a term of two years, with automatic one-year renewal terms unless either party gives at least a three-month advance notice of non-renewal. If Mr. Jankovic is terminated without cause (with one month advance notice of termination without cause), then, in exchange for a mutual general release, the Company will pay healthcare coverage for one year, unvested options granted in 2003 would be accelerated and all vested options would be exercisable for five years after termination of employment. If within one year after a change of control, Mr. Jankovic is terminated without cause or chooses to leave for "good reason," then he will receive the termination without cause benefits above and a lump sum payment equal to salary for one year plus his target bonus for the year of termination. The agreement provide
s for a cap to the executive's compensation if it produces a greater net benefit than an uncapped award would after accounting for the increased tax obligation resulting from being an excess parachute payment under sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. The agreement defines "good reason" after a change of control as (1) the executive is transferred more than 50 miles without consent; or (2) a material reduction of authority, duties or responsibilities after reasonable notice and a chance to cure; or (3) any failure of the Company materially to comply with and satisfy the terms of the agreement; or (4) non-renewal of the agreement by the Company.

EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT



This Employment Agreement is made and
entered into as of February 7, 2005 (the “Effective Date”) by and between
Furniture Brands International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Furniture
Brands”) and Denise L. Ramos (“Ramos”).



WHEREAS, Ramos has recently
been elected Senior Vice-President and Treasurer and has been appointed Chief Financial
Officer of Furniture Brands; and



WHEREAS, Furniture Brands and
Ramos wish to enter into an Employment Agreement to set forth the terms and conditions of
her employment with Furniture Brands;



NOW THEREFORE, in accordance
with the authority granted by the Furniture Brands Board of Directors, and for good and
valuable consideration the parties covenant and agree as follows:



1.
Definitions.     The following terms shall have the following meanings for
purposes of this Agreement.



a.  	  	“Cause” means
(i) an act or acts of personal dishonesty taken                by Ramos and intended to
result in substantial personal enrichment of Ramos at                the expense of
Furniture Brands, (ii) violations by Ramos of this Agreement or                Ramos’ employment
obligations to Furniture Brands which are demonstrably                willful on Ramos’ part
and which are not remedied within a reasonable                period of time after
receipt of written notice from Furniture Brands, or (iii)                the conviction
of Ramos of a felony involving moral turpitude.






b.  	  	“Disability” means
the incapacity to attend to and perform                effectively one’s duties and
responsibilities which continues for at least                26 weeks after its
commencement, as determined by a physician selected by                Furniture Brands.






c.  	  	“Employment
Period” that period beginning on the Effective Date                and ending
upon Ramos’ retirement or earlier termination of employment.






2.
Employment.     Furniture Brands agrees to employ Ramos, and Ramos agrees to
serve Furniture Brands in an executive, managerial and supervisory capacity,
subject to the direction and control of the Board of Directors of Furniture
Brands, all upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. During the
Employment Period:



a. 	  	Ramos’ position
(including, without limitation, status, offices, titles and                reporting
requirements), authority, duties and responsibilities shall be at                least
commensurate in all material respects with the most significant of those
held, exercised and assigned as of the Effective Date;






b. 	  	Ramos’ services
shall be performed at the location where the Ramos is                employed on the
Effective Date, or at any office or location not more than                thirty-five
(35) miles from such location;



















c. 	  	Ramos
shall continue to receive an annual base salary at least equal to the
annual base salary payable to the Ramos by Furniture Brands on the
Effective                Date (“Base Salary”);






d. 	  	Ramos
shall continue to have an annual cash bonus potential, either pursuant to
the Furniture Brands Executive Incentive Plan in effect on the Effective
Date or                pursuant to a similar incentive compensation plan of Furniture
Brands, at least                equal to the level in existence on the Effective Date (“Annual
Bonus”); and






e. 	  	Ramos
shall be entitled to participate in all incentive, savings and retirement
plans, practices, policies and programs applicable to other key executive
employees of Furniture Brands (“Benefit Plans”).






The failure of Furniture Brands,
without Ramos’ consent, to comply with the terms and conditions of employment as set
forth in this Section 2 shall constitute “Good Reason” for Ramos’
termination of her employment with Furniture Brands.



3.
Best Efforts.     Ramos agrees during the Employment Period to devote her
best efforts and substantially all of her business time and attention to the
business of Furniture Brands. Ramos agrees that she will perform such other
executive duties for Furniture Brands and for Furniture Brands’
subsidiaries relating to its business as the Board of Directors of Furniture
Brands may reasonably direct.



4.
Term.     Subject to the provisions of Section 4 of this Agreement, either
party shall have the right to terminate the Employment Period at any time. If
Ramos’ employment with Furniture Brands is terminated by Furniture Brands,
other than for Cause or as a result of her death or Disability, or if Ramos
terminates her employment with Furniture Brands for Good Reason, then Furniture
Brands will, for the greater of (a) the period ending two years after the
Effective Date or (b) a period of one year after the termination date (or, if
shorter, until Ramos reaches “Normal Retirement Age” (as such concept
is used in the primary retirement plan in which Ramos is a participant on the
Effective Date)), (i) pay to Ramos as and when normally payable her Base Salary
as in effect on the date of termination and an amount equal to the average
Annual Bonus received by such Ramos for the past three years prior to
termination (or a pro-rated portion of such average Annual Bonus) and (ii)
subject to program eligibility requirements and continuation of programs by
Furniture Brands, continue her participation in the Benefit Plans in which she
was participating on the date of termination of employment.



5.
Non-Competition.     During the two-year period commencing on the Effective
Date and, if longer, while employed by Furniture Brands, and for a period of one
year after termination of employment, Ramos shall not, without the prior written
consent of Furniture Brands, directly or indirectly, own, control, finance,
manage, operate, join or participate in the ownership, control, financing,
management or operation of, or be connected as an employee, consultant or in any
other capacity with, any business engaged in the manufacture or distribution of
residential furniture in the
















United States. Nothing in this
Section 5 shall,           however, restrict Ramos from making investments in other
ventures which are not           competitive with Furniture Brands, or restrict Ramos
from owning less than one           percent (1%) of the outstanding securities of
companies listed on a national           stock exchange or actively traded in the “over-the-counter” market.
In           addition, if the Employment Period is terminated by Furniture Brands (other
than           for Cause) and the Ramos elects to forego the payments called for in
Section 4           hereof, the provisions of this Section 5 shall not apply. Should any
of the           terms of this Section 5 be found to be unenforceable because they are
over-broad           in any respects then they shall be deemed amended to the extent, and
only to the           extent, necessary to render them enforceable. Both parties
stipulate that money           damages would be inadequate to compensate for any breaches
of the terms of this           Section 5, and that such terms shall be enforceable
through appropriate           equitable relief, without the necessity of proving actual
damages and to an           equitable accounting of all earnings, profits, and other
benefits arising from           such violation, which rights shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other           rights and remedies to which Furniture Brands may be
entitled.



6.
Confidentiality.     During the Employment Period and at all times
thereafter, Ramos shall maintain the confidentiality of, and shall not disclose
to any person (except as her duties as an employee of Furniture Brands may
require) any non-public information concerning Furniture Brands or its business.



7.
Miscellaneous.     This Employment Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of Ramos’ heirs, executors, administrators and legal
representatives, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Furniture
Brands and its successors and assigns. This Employment Agreement shall take
effect as of the day and year first above set forth, and its validity,
interpretation, construction and performance shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Missouri.



8.
Indemnification.     In the event that either party hereto is required to
pursue litigation against the other party to enforce her or its rights
hereunder, the prevailing party in any such litigation shall be entitled to
reimbursement of the costs and expenses of such litigation, including
attorney’s fees.



9.
Waivers.     In consideration of the undertakings of Furniture Brands set
forth in this Agreement, Ramos hereby irrevocably waives and forever releases
any and all claims and causes of action of any nature whatsoever that Ramos has
or may have against Furniture Brands or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents arising out of the negotiation, execution, delivery or terms
of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any claims arising under the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §21 et seq., and any state
or local law relating to age discrimination.



10.
Entire Agreement.     This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the
parties with respect to its subject matter, and no waiver, modification or
change of any of its provisions shall be valid unless in writing and signed by
the party against whom such claimed waiver, modification or change is sought to
be enforced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement incorporates as
though fully set forth herein the terms of the letter agreement dated December
14, 2004 by and between Furniture Brands and Ramos. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of that letter
agreement, the terms of the letter agreement shall control.

SIXTH ADDENDUM TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

Addendum”) is made effective as of the 22nd day of February, 2008, by and between Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation, a Maryland corporation (“Anworth”), and Joseph E. McAdams (the “Executive”).
W I T N E S S E T H :
WHEREAS, the
Executive and Anworth Mortgage Advisory Corporation (the “Company”) entered into an employment agreement dated January 1, 2002 (as amended to date, the “Agreement”);
WHEREAS, the Agreement was assumed by Anworth and the Executive, and the Company and Anworth entered into an addendum to such employment agreement dated
April 18, 2002 (the “Addendum”), an addendum to such employment agreement dated June 13, 2002 (the “Second Addendum”), an addendum to such employment agreement dated May 28, 2004 (the “Third Addendum”),
an addendum to such employment agreement dated June 27, 2006 (the “Fourth Addendum”) and an addendum to such employment agreement dated February 13, 2008 (the “Fifth Addendum”);
WHEREAS, Anworth and the Executive desire to further modify the terms of the Executive’s employment under the Agreement.
NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereby covenant and agree as follows:
1. Effective Date. This Sixth Addendum shall become effective on the date hereof.
2.
Incentive Plan and Bonus (Section 4(b) of the Agreement). The Agreement is hereby amended by the addition of Section 4(b)(iii) as follows:
4(b)(iii) 2004 Equity Plan. The Executive shall be eligible to participate in a Restricted Stock Pool (the “Pool”) each year during the Term of Employment unless notified prior to the beginning of the year by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) that the Executive will not participate in the Pool during the following year.


1








The Pool shall be determined by reference to Anworth’s Return on Average Equity as more fully described in Exhibit A
to this Agreement, and shall be allocated among the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Investment Officer based on the assessment by the Compensation Committee of each participant’s performance.
The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, can adjust the aggregate Pool downward in any year by as much as ten percent (10%) depending upon the Compensation
Committee’s assessment of Anworth’s leverage, book value stability and share price relative to peer group, among other considerations.
Fifty
percent (50%) of any amount in excess of $100,000 allocated to the Executive from the Pool with respect to calendar year 2008 and each subsequent year will be paid in restricted stock in accordance with the 2004 Equity Plan.
Such restricted stock cannot be transferred or sold during the Executive’s employment by Anworth until the value of the Executive’s stock holdings in Anworth
exceeds seven and one-half times the Salary; and then the restricted stock may be sold or transferred only to the extent that the value of the Executive’s stock holdings exceeds this multiple of Salary.
If the Compensation Committee should notify the Executive prior to the following year that the Executive will not participate in the Pool during the following year, the
sale or transfer restrictions on previously issued Pool shares will be eliminated at that time.
3. Restricted Stock Pool (Exhibit
A). The Agreement is hereby amended by the addition of Exhibit A to the Agreement, which is attached to this Fourth Addendum as Exhibit A.
4. Remaining Terms Unchanged. The parties agree that all terms and conditions of the Agreement (as modified by this Sixth Addendum), including, but not limited to, all provisions pertaining to compensation, termination, choice
of law and arbitration, shall remain in full force and effect as modified hereby.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Sixth Addendum to Employment Agreement is executed as of the day and year first
above written.

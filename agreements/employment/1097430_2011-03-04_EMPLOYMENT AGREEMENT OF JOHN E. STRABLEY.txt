XI.


Liability and Indemnification





IMS' bylaws provide for the elimination, to the fullest extent permissible under Wisconsin law, of the liability of its officers and directors to the Company for monetary damages. This limitation of liability does not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief. The Company's bylaws also provide that 1MS shall indemnify its directors and officers against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status for service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from certain specified misconduct. IMS is required to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them for which they could be indemnified, including in circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary under Wisconsin law. At the present time, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Company in which indemnification would be required or permitted. IMS is not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding which may result in a claim for such indemnification.












XII.


Contract Interpretation and Enforcement. This agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, their personal representatives, heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns. As used in this agreement, the term "successor" shall include any person, firm, corporation, or other business entity which, at any time, whether by merger, purchase, or other means, acquires all, or substantially all, or the assets of IMS and/or IMS. This contract may not be modified except in a written agreement signed by all parties. The terms and conditions of this contract shall be governed by the laws of the state of Wisconsin and shall take precedence over and supersede the language of any previous agreements, whether oral or written.












XIII.


Severability. If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement are determined to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain fully operative.












XIV.


Entire Agreement. This document constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof. This Agreement supersedes any and all other agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter thereof.

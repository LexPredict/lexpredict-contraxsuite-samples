SECTION 5 – CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT





Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain
Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers





(a)On
January 16, 2015, the Company entered into a new Executive Employment Agreement with Michael T. Adams, Chief Governance
Officer (“CGO”), Executive Vice President (“EVP”), and Corporate Secretary, with an effective date of December
31, 2014 (“Adams Executive Agreement”). Mr. Adams is one of the founders of the Company starting on January 1, 1997.
He was appointed to the Board on December 20, 2004. Mr. Adams was appointed CGO in July 2006, and has been EVP and Corporate Secretary
since January 1999. During his term with Lapolla, Mr. Adams also served as president and interim chief executive officer, treasurer
and interim chief financial officer, and held various officer positions in the Company’s former subsidiaries. Mr. Adams earned
his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in business administration, and Juris Doctor degrees from Nova Southeastern University,
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Mr. Adams is 49 years old. No familial relationships exist between Mr. Adams and any director, executive
officer, or person nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer.





Pursuant to the Adams
Executive Agreement, Mr. Adams will continue to serve as CGO, EVP, and Corporate Secretary for a term commencing on December 31,
2014 and ending December 31, 2017 (the “Employment Term”). In addition, Mr. Adams is entitled to: (i) an annual base
salary of $180,000; (ii) annual bonus equal to 25% of his annual base salary if the Company achieves its budgeted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation (“Adjusted EBITDA”) per calendar year, which
annual bonus may be increased to 30%, 35%, or more than 35% in the CEO’s discretion, of his annual base salary if the Company
achieves 110%, 120%, or more than 120%, respectively, of its budgeted Adjusted EBITDA; (iii) annual non-discretionary bonus of
$5,000; (iv) transaction bonus, subject to certain limitations, upon consummation of a change in control if he is still employed
at the time or in the event his employment is terminated within one (1) year immediately preceding the consummation of a change
in control; (v) medical, dental, life insurance, and disability benefits; (vi) auto allowance of $750.00 per month; (vii) twelve
months of his annual base salary for termination due to death or disability; (viii) twelve months of his annual base salary, awards
and medical and dental benefits and the transaction bonus in the event of termination without cause by the Company or by him for
good reason; and (ix) the annual base salary that would be payable over the remaining term of his agreement and any outstanding
awards or other benefits held by him under any Company plan or program, which have not vested in accordance with their terms will
become fully vested and exercisable in the event of termination following a change in control. Mr. Adams is also entitled to earn
awards under equity or other plans or programs that the Company, in its discretion, determine to put into effect and to participate
in compensation and benefit programs offered by the Company to its executive officers. The Adams Agreement also provides for a
non-competition provision for the Employment Term and for a period of twelve months after the termination of Mr. Adams’ employment.





(b)On January 16, 2015, the
Company granted an eight-year stock option to Michael T. Adams, CGO, EVP, and Corporate Secretary, for 300,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company’s
common stock on the date of grant, determined based on the per share closing price on such date, or $0.325 per share (“Adams
Option”). The foregoing stock options vest in three equal end of calendar year increments, subject to Mr. Adams meeting certain
performance criteria, commencing on December 31, 2015 and ending December 31, 2017, or upon consummation of a change in control.
Once vested, the stock options are immediately exercisable.





(c)On January 16, 2015, the
Company granted Douglas J. Kramer, CEO and President, the right to acquire 850,000 shares of the Company’s common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, at an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common
stock on the date of grant, determined based on the per share closing price on such date, or $0.325 per share, which options were
immediately vested and exercisable at the time of grant (“Kramer Option”). The foregoing Kramer Option was granted
as final replacement for 2,000,000 stock options granted on July 12, 2005 which expired July 12, 2013 (the “Prior Expired
Options”). The Prior Expired Options were inadvertently extended to December 31, 2015, however, due to an 8 year life limitation
under the Company’s Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Equity Plan”), they were deemed canceled at the end
of 8 years. Moreover, the Equity Plan only permits the grant of a total of 2,000,000 stock options during any calendar year. Mr.
Kramer had exceeded this limit during the 2014 year and as a result, the Company was only able to grant Mr. Kramer 1,150,000 stock
options during the 2014 year as partial replacement for the 2,000,000 Prior Expired Options.





The foregoing
summaries of the Adams Executive Agreement, the Adams Option, and the Kramer Option are not complete and are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements that are filed as exhibits to this current report and incorporated herein
by this reference.

A. PROVISION OF SEPARATION BENEFITS. In the event that the Employee's
employment with all members of the Company Group is terminated, the
Company shall, subject to the requirement of subsection B below,
provide the separation benefits specified in subsection C below unless
the Employee's termination of employment results from:

1. The Employee voluntarily resigning or otherwise terminating
his employment or services (including job abandonment, death
or disability) with any member of the Company Group for any
reason.

2. The termination of the Employee's employment by a member of
the Company Group at a time when the Employee has an offer of
immediate employment with another member of the Company Group.

3. The termination of the Employee's employment by a member of
the Company Group for "Cause".

B. SEPARATION BENEFITS CONTINGENT ON EXECUTED AND VALID RELEASE. No
separation benefits specified in subsection C below shall be provided
to the Employee unless and until the Employee has executed a separation
and release agreement with the Company in a form reasonably acceptable
to the Company, and such separation and release agreement has become
valid and enforceable. Such separation and release agreement shall
contain provisions in which (1) the Employee shall agree to a date of
termination of employment with all members of the Company Group, and
(2) the Employee shall release and discharge the Company Group and
their related employees, directors, consultants, advisors, and other
persons from any claim or liability, whether known or unknown, arising
out of the Employee's employment with members of the Company Group or
the termination of such employment.

C. SEPARATION BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED. The separation benefits that the
Employee shall receive under subsection A above shall consist of:

1. A cash amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the regular
annual salary (exclusive of bonuses, commissions, and any
other extra compensation) of the Employee in effect as of the
Employee's date of termination of employment multiplied by the
number of months of the Employee's Separation Period, which
shall be payable in installments consistent with the Company's
general payroll practices over the Employee's Separation
Period; and

2. Reimbursement of any COBRA group health plan premiums paid
by the Employee for the coverage of the Employee and/or any of
the Employee's covered dependents during the Separation
Period. Reimbursements will be made within fifteen (15) days
following submission of proof of the expense and the payment
thereof by the Employee.

All payments will be subject to applicable federal, state and local tax
withholdings.

D. DEFINITIONS. For this purpose, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

determined to be disabled under the company's long-term
disability plan, if any, and/or under the Federal Social
Security Act.

2. The term "Cause" shall mean an act or acts by the Employee

Amendment to Executive Employment Agreement


Exhibit 10.1
AMENDMENT TO EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
This Amendment to the Executive Employment Agreement
(this “Amendment”) is made as of December 23, 2008 by and between Language Line, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and Dennis Dracup (“Executive”) and amends the Executive
Employment Agreement between the Company and the Executive dated as of June 11, 2004, as amended March 23, 2006 (as amended, the “Employment Agreement”). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the Employment Agreement.
WHEREAS, the Company and Executive now wish to amend the Employment Agreement to
comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the treasury regulations and other official guidance promulgated thereunder in accordance with the provisions of Section 16(b) of the
Employment Agreement.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
FIRST: The penultimate sentence
of Section 4(a) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the sentence in its entirety and replacing it with the following language:
“Any Bonus awarded under this Agreement will be payable during the calendar year following the year to which such Bonus relates, but in any event, within the period ending no later than the date that is 2 1/2
months from the end of (1) the Executive’s tax year in which the Bonus was earned, or (2) the Company’s tax year in which the Bonus was earned by the Executive.”
SECOND: The Employment Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following as a new Section 17 to read in full as follows:
“Section 17. Section 409A.
(a) The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (“Code Section 409A”),
and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. To the extent that any provision hereof is modified in order to comply with Code Section 409A, such modification shall be made
in good faith and shall, to the maximum extent reasonably possible, maintain the original intent and economic benefit to the parties hereto of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Code Section 409A. In no event
whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on Executive by Code Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.






(b) Notwithstanding any other payment schedule provided herein to the contrary, if Executive is deemed on
the date of termination to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then each of the following shall apply:


(i)	With regard to any payment that is considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A payable on account of a “separation from service,” such payment shall be
made on the date which is the earlier of (A) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such “separation from service” of Executive, and (B) the date of Executive’s death (the “Delay
Period”) to the extent required under Code Section 409A. Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments delayed pursuant to this Section 17 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments
in the absence of such delay) shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum, and all remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein; and




(ii)	To the extent that any benefits to be provided during the Delay Period are considered deferred compensation under Code Section 409A provided on account of a “separation
from service,” and such benefits are not otherwise exempt from Code Section 409A, Executive shall pay the cost of such benefits during the Delay Period, and the Company shall reimburse Executive, to the extent that such costs would
otherwise have been paid by the Company or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise have been provided by the Company at no cost to Executive, the Company’s share of the cost of such benefits upon expiration of the Delay Period, and any
remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the procedures specified herein.

(c) To
the extent that severance payments or benefits pursuant to this Agreement are conditioned upon the execution and delivery by the Executive of a release of claims, the Executive shall forfeit all rights to such payments and benefits unless such
release is signed and delivered (and no longer subject to revocation, if applicable) within sixty (60) days following the Termination Date. If the foregoing release is executed and delivered and no longer subject to revocation as provided in
the preceding sentence, then the following shall apply:


(i)	To the extent any such cash payment or continuing benefit to be provided is not ‘deferred compensation’ for purposes of Code Section 409A, then such payment or
benefit shall commence upon the first scheduled payment date immediately after the date the release is executed and no longer subject to revocation (the ‘Release Effective Date’). The first such cash payment shall include payment of
all amounts that otherwise would have been due prior to the Release Effective Date under the terms of this Agreement applied as though such payments commenced immediately upon the Termination Date, and any payments made thereafter shall continue as
provided herein. The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the time such benefits would have expired had such benefits commenced immediately following the Termination Date.











(ii)	To the extent any such cash payment or continuing benefit to be provided is ‘deferred compensation’ for purposes of Code Section 409A, then such payments or benefits
shall be made or commence upon the sixtieth (60) day following the Termination Date. The first such cash payment shall include payment of all amounts that otherwise would have been due prior thereto under the terms of this Agreement had such
payments commenced immediately upon the Termination Date, and any payments made thereafter shall continue as provided herein. The delayed benefits shall in any event expire at the time such benefits would have expired had such benefits commenced
immediately following the Termination Date.

The Company may provide, in its sole discretion, that Executive may continue to
participate in any benefits delayed pursuant to this section during the period of such delay, provided that the Executive shall bear the full cost of such benefits during such delay period. Upon the date such benefits would otherwise commence
pursuant to this Section, the Company may reimburse the Executive the Company’s share of the cost of such benefits, to the extent that such costs would otherwise have been paid by the Company or to the extent that such benefits would otherwise
have been provided by the Company at no cost to the Executive, in each case had such benefits commenced immediately upon the Termination Date. Any remaining benefits shall be reimbursed or provided by the Company in accordance with the schedule and
procedures specified herein.
(d) For purposes of Code Section 409A, Executive’s right to receive any installment payments
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g., “payment shall be made
within thirty (30) days”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.
(e) A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination
is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Code Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall
mean “separation from service.”
(f) For purposes of compliance with Code Section 409A, (i) all expenses or other
reimbursements hereunder shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such expenses were incurred by Executive, (ii) any right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to
liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (iii) no such reimbursement, expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind
benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year.









(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment
under this Agreement that constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation” for purposes of Code Section 409A be subject to offset by any other amount unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.”
THIRD: Except as expressly set forth herein, this Amendment shall not alter, modify, amend or in any way affect any of the terms, conditions,
covenants, obligations or agreements contained in the Employment Agreement, all of which are ratified and affirmed in all respects and shall continue to be in full force and effect.
FOURTH: This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, which taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement and each of which individually shall be deemed to be an original, with the same effect as if the signature on each counterpart were on the same original.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amendment as of the date first written above.

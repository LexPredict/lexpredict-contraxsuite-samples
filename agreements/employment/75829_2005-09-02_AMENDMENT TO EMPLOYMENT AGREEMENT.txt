Exhibit 10.2

AMENDMENT DATED AUGUST 30, 2005 TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

The EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT dated May 1, 2003 between PALL CORPORATION, a New York Corporation (the “Company”) and Marcus Wilson (“Executive”) as amended by AMENDMENT DATED NOVEMBER 19, 2003 TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (said Employment Agreement as so amended being hereinafter called the “Agreement”) is hereby further amended by adding, after §3 (d) of the Agreement, three new subsections reading and providing as follows:


“(e)      Severance.
In the event that, after the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in
the Bonus Plan) the Term of Employment is terminated by Executive by the giving
of notice under §4(c) hereof, Executive shall be entitled to receive from
the Company, as severance pay, a single lump sum cash payment in an amount equal
to the present value, determined as of the date on which the Term of Employment
ends as specified in Executive’s termination notice, of (i) the Base Salary
that would have been paid to Executive during or with respect to the 24-month
period following the end of the Term of Employment if Base Salary had continued
to be payable to Executive during or with respect to such period at the same
annual rate at which Executive’s Base Salary was payable immediately prior
to the end of the Term of Employment (the “Base Salary Severance Component”)
and (ii) an amount (the “Bonus Severance Component”) equal to the
Base Salary Severance Component multiplied by Executive’s Target Bonus
Percentage under §3 (b) of the Agreement as in effect on the date on which
the Term of Employment ends as specified in Executive’s termination notice.
In determining such present value, it shall be assumed (i) that the Base Salary
Severance Component is payable in equal periodic installments, at the same times
that Executive’s Base Salary would have been payable if the Term of Employment
had not ended and (ii) that Bonus Severance Component of the severance pay, provided
for in clause “(ii)” of the preceding sentence, is payable in two
equal installments, at the end of the 12th month and the 24th month of such 24-month
period. In determining such present value, the discount rate to be used















shall be equal to the yield to maturity on the
issue of two-year U.S. Treasury Notes most recently offered by the U.S.
Treasury Department for sale to the public prior to the date on which the
Term of Employment ends. The severance payment provided for herein shall
be made within 20 days after the end of the Term of Employment to Executive
(or if Executive has died, to “Executive’s
Successor” as defined in §3(f) below).

(f)      Delay
in Payment. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any payment otherwise
required to be made hereunder to Executive at any date as a result of
the termination of the Term of Employment shall be delayed for such period
of time as may be necessary to meet the requirements of section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”).
On the earliest date on which such payments can be made without violating
the requirements of section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (the “Delayed
Payment Date”), there shall be paid to Executive (or if Executive
has died, to “Executive’s Successor” as the quoted
term is defined below), in a single cash lump sum, an amount equal to
the aggregate amount of all payments delayed pursuant to the preceding
sentence, plus interest thereon at the Delayed Payment Interest Rate
(as defined below) computed from the date on which each such delayed
payment otherwise would have been made to Executive until the Delayed
Payment Date. For purposes of the foregoing: (i)  “Executive’s
Successor” shall mean such payee or payees as Executive shall at
any time (whether during or after the Term of Employment) designate by
written notice to the Company or in his last will and testament or, if
no such designation is made, then to the legal representatives of Executive’s
estate, and (ii) the “Delayed Payment Interest Rate” shall
mean the national average annual rate of interest payable on jumbo six-month
bank certificates of deposit, as quoted in the business section of the most
recently published Sunday edition of the New York Times preceding
the date on which the Term of Employment ends.



(g)     Section
4999 Excise Tax.  If any payments to Executive, whether under this Agreement
or otherwise, would be subject to excise tax under section










4999 of the Code, then payments hereunder
shall be reduced or deferred to the extent required (and only to the
extent required) to avoid the application of section 4999; provided, however,
that no such reduction or deferral shall be made unless as a result thereof
Executive’s after-tax economic position (taking into account not
only payments under this Agreement and the taxes thereon, but also the
taxes that would otherwise be imposed on any payments to which Executive
is otherwise entitled) would be improved. In making the determination
whether Executive’s after-tax economic position would be so improved,
the judgment of a certified public accountant or attorney chosen by Executive
shall be final. In the event of a reduction or deferral of payments pursuant
to this paragraph, Executive shall be entitled to specify which payments
shall be reduced or deferred.”


Words and terms used herein with initial capital letters and not defined herein are used herein as defined in the Agreement.

This Amendment is effective on and as of the date first set forth above and the Agreement, as amended hereby, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have executed this
Amendment as of the date first above written.


PALL CORPORATION

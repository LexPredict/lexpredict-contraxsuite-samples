December 3, 2008
Mr. Gerald P. Quindlen


Re:	Employment Agreement

Dear Jerry:
This amended and restated letter agreement sets forth the terms of your employment with Logitech Inc., a California corporation (the
“Company”), as well as our understanding with respect to any termination of that employment relationship. Effective on the date set forth above, this letter agreement supersedes your offer letter dated January 28, 2008, in its
entirety.
1. Position and Duties. You will be employed by the Company as President and Chief Executive Officer and will serve in
the positions set forth on Exhibit A. In such positions, you will have the duties and authority at a level consistent with the duties and authority set forth on Exhibit A. You accept employment with the Company on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and you agree to devote your full business time, energy and skill to your duties.
2. Term
of Employment. Your employment with the Company will continue for no specified term and may be terminated by you or the Company at any time, with or without cause, subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 below.

3. Compensation. You will be compensated for your services to the Company as follows:
(a) Salary: As determined by the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the
“Board”) of Logitech International S.A. (“Logitech”), you will be paid a bi-weekly salary of $30,288.46, payable every two weeks less applicable withholding (annualized this amount is $787,500), in accordance with normal payroll
procedures. Your salary will be reviewed by the Board or the Compensation Committee from time to time (but no more frequently than annually) and may be subject to adjustment based upon various factors including, but not limited to, your performance
and Logitech’s profitability. Any adjustment to your salary shall be in the sole discretion of the Board or the Compensation Committee.
(b) Incentive Bonus: As determined by the Compensation Committee, you will
be eligible to receive an annual bonus under the Logitech Management Performance Bonus Plan. Your bonus under this plan will be based upon Logitech’s achievement of various financial goals established and approved by the Board or the
Compensation Committee. The bonus target as a percentage of your salary under the bonus plan will be reviewed and approved by the Board or the Compensation Committee. Any bonus for a fiscal year will be paid within 2 1
/2 months after the close of that fiscal year.

(c) Benefits: You will have the right, on the same basis as other employees of
the Company, to participate in and to receive benefits under any applicable medical, disability or other group insurance plans, as well as under the Company’s business expense reimbursement and other policies. You will accrue paid vacation in
accordance with the Company’s vacation policy. The Company reserves the right to cancel or change the benefit plans and programs it offers to its employees at any time.
4. Voluntary Termination. In the event that you voluntarily resign from your employment with the Company, or in the event that your employment
terminates as a result of your death or disability (meaning that you are unable to perform your duties for any 90 days in any one-year period as a result of a physical and/or mental impairment), you will be entitled to no compensation or benefits
from the Company other than those earned under Paragraph 3 through the date of your termination. You agree that if you voluntarily terminate your employment with the Company for any reason, you will provide the Company with 30 days’
written notice of your resignation. The Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive all or any part of such notice period and accept your resignation at an earlier date.
5. Other Termination. Your employment may be terminated under the circumstances set forth below.
(a) Termination for Cause: If your employment is terminated by the Company for cause as defined below, you shall be entitled to no
compensation or benefits from the Company other than those earned under Paragraph 3 through the date of your termination for cause.
For purposes of this Agreement, a termination “for cause” occurs if you are terminated for any of the following reasons: (i) theft, dishonesty, misconduct or falsification of any employment or Company
records; (ii) improper disclosure of the Company’s confidential or proprietary information; (iii) any action by you which has a material detrimental effect on the Company’s reputation or business; (iv) your failure or
inability to perform any assigned duties after written notice from the Company to you of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure, such failure or inability; (v) your conviction (including any plea of guilty or no contest) of a felony, or of any
other criminal act if that act impairs your ability to perform your duties under this Agreement or (vi) your failure to cooperate in good faith with a governmental or internal investigation of the Company or its directors, officers or
employees, if the Company has requested your cooperation. For purposes of this paragraph only, “Company” shall mean Logitech and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
(b) Termination Without Cause: If a Separation occurs because your employment is terminated by the Company without cause (and not
as a result of your death or disability), and if you sign a general release of known and unknown claims in form satisfactory to the Company, you will receive severance payments equal to your current compensation, less applicable withholding, for
twelve months after the date of the Separation. Your current compensation shall mean the sum of your base salary plus your current annual targeted bonus amount. Severance payments representing base salary will be made periodically in accordance

with the Company’s normal payroll schedule, and the severance payment representing the annual targeted bonus amount will be made in one lump sum at the
end of the twelve-month severance period, less applicable withholding. The Company will deliver the form of release to you within 30 days after your Separation. You must execute and return the release within the period set forth in the prescribed
form. The salary continuation payments will commence within 30 days after you return the release. During the twelve-month severance period, the Company will pay the premiums to continue your group health insurance coverage under COBRA if you are
eligible for COBRA and have elected continuation coverage under the applicable rules. However, the Company’s COBRA obligations shall immediately cease to the extent you become eligible for benefits from a subsequent employer.
For purposes of this Agreement, “Separation” means a “separation from service,” as defined in the regulations under
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
(c) Commencement of
Payments. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, each salary continuation payment under Paragraph (b) above is hereby designated as a separate payment. If the Company determines that you are a “specified employee” under
Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code at the time of your Separation, then (i) the salary continuation payments under Paragraph (b) above, to the extent that they are subject to Section 409A of the Code, will commence during the
seventh month after your Separation and (ii) the installments that otherwise would have been paid during the first six months after your Separation will be paid in a lump sum when the salary continuation payments commence.
6. Change of Control Severance Agreement. In the event that any amounts become payable to you under the Change of Control Agreement dated
December 3, 2008, among you, the Company and Logitech or under any successor agreement, the aggregate amount of any amounts payable to you under Paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement will be reduced, but only to the extent necessary so as to
prevent the duplication of severance payments to you.
7. Confidential and Proprietary Information. As a condition of your
employment, you signed the Company’s standard form of employee confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreement, and this remains in effect.
8. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected.
9. Assignment. In view of the
personal nature of the services to be performed under this Agreement by you, you cannot assign or transfer any of your obligations under this Agreement.
10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the agreements referred to above constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the terms and conditions of your employment, and they supersede
all prior negotiations, representations or agreements between you and the Company regarding your employment, whether written or oral.

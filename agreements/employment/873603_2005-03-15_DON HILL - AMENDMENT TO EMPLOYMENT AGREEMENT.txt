Re:  Employment Agreement

Dear Don:

Reference is made to the employment agreement ("Employment
Agreement"), dated as of October 10, 2000, by and between you and Excel
Technology, Inc. (the "Corporation").  Capitalized terms not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Employment
Agreement.

When agreed to and accepted by you in the space provided below, the
Employment Agreement shall be amended, as follows:

1.  The Employment Period in Section 2.01 shall be extended through
October 9, 2007.

2.  A new Section 5.05 shall be added to read as follows:

"5.05  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the provisions of the last sentence of Section 5.04 hereof, if
the Employee voluntarily leaves the employ of the Company on
account of a Change of Control (as defined below), then the
Employee shall be entitled to a payment of $1,000,000, plus a
gross-up of any excise tax payable by Employee with respect to
any portion of such payment constituting an excess parachute
payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.  For
purposes of this Section, a Change of Control shall mean (a)
the acquisition by any person (including a person defined in
Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act")), entity or group
(excluding for this purpose, Employee, any person (as defined
above), entity or group of which Employee is a member, or any
employee benefit plan of the Company or its subsidiaries) of
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of more than 50% of either
the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or
the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, (b) the sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company in a transaction or series of
transactions, (c) the merger of the Company with another
entity where the Company is not the surviving entity, or (d)
individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board
of Directors (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to
constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors,
provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to the
date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the
Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board
(other than an election or nomination of an individual whose
initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual
or threatened election contest relating to the election of the
Directors of the Company, as such terms are used in Rule 14a-
11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall
be, for purposes of this Agreement, considered as though such
person was a member of the Incumbent Board."

This agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

Except as amended or modified herein, the Employment Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect.




Sincerely,

EXCEL TECHNOLOGY, INC.

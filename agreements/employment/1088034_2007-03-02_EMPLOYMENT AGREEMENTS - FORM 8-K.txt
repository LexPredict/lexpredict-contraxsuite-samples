The foregoing description of  the  terms and conditions of the Employment Agreements is qualified  in  its  entirety  by,  and  made  subject  to,  the more  complete information set forth in the Employment Agreements between Payment Data Systems, Inc. and Michael R. Long and Louis A. Hoch, included on this Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated  herein by  reference.




This report contains forward-looking  statements  that  involve  risks  and uncertainties. We generally use words such as "believe," "may," "could," "will," "intend,"  "expect,"  "anticipate,"  "plan," and similar expressions to identify forward-looking  statements. You should  not  place  undue  reliance  on these forward-looking  statements.  Our  actual  results  could differ materially from those  anticipated  in the forward-looking statements for many reasons including our  ability  to  implement  our  business plan, our ability to raise additional funds and manage our substantial debts, consumer acceptance of our products, our ability  to  broaden  our  customer base, and other risks described in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissi
on from time to time. Although we believe  the  expectations  reflected  in  the  forward-looking  statements  are reasonable,  they  relate  only to events as of the date on which the statements are  made,  and  our  future  results,  levels  of  activity,  performance  or achievements  may not meet these expectations. We do not intend to update any of the  forward-looking statements after the date of this document to conform these statements  to  actual  results  or  to  changes  in our expectations, except as required  by  law.

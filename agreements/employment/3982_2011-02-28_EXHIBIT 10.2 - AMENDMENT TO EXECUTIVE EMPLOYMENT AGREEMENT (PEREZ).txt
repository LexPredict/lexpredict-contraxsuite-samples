Exhibit 1





Illustration of Separation Payments





Assumptions:





Executive's employment terminates by "Constructive Termination" on August 15, 2011.





At the date of such termination, Executive's annual base salary is $315,000, and his annual car allowance is $12,000.





Salary and car allowance are paid in bi-weekly payments of $12,576.92. Each payment is comprised of comprised of  $12,115.38 in salary and $461.54 of car allowance.





Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of IRC 409A(a)(2)(B)(i).





The first regularly scheduled pay day following the date of termination is August 19, 2011.





Analysis:





“Separation Payments” is defined in Section 7(b)(ii) to mean continuation payments of the Executive’s salary and car allowance (as in effect on the termination date).  Other benefits and amounts provided for in Section 7(b)(ii) are not within the definition of “Separation Payments” and are not reflected in this Exhibit.





Under Section 7(b)(ii) of the Executive Employment Agreement, Executive is entitled to Separation Payments of  $653,999.84 which represents 2 years x 26 payments per year x $12,576.92 .





Under Section 7(b)(ii) of the Executive Employment Agreement, those Separation Payments exempt from IRC 409A under Reg. §1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) are to be paid in a single lump sum payment due within 10 days of the date of the Constructive Termination.  The amount so exempt and payable in a lump sum payment is $490,000.00.





Under Section 7(b)(iii), the remaining Separation Payments and any partial payment are to be paid, subject to the deferral provisions of Section 7(c), on the regularly scheduled pay days beginning with the first such pay day occurring after the date of termination.





Section 7(c) requires that any Separation Payments, not otherwise exempt from IRC 409A, and that would be payable within 6 months of the date of termination shall be deferred, held by the Company, and paid in a single lump sum amount on the first day of the 7th calendar month beginning after the date of termination.





Conclusion:





Based on the foregoing, the Separation Payments to Executive would be paid as follows:







Payable after termination, but not later than August 25, 2011:


$490,000.00

Payable on March 1, 2012:

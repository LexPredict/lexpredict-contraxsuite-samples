Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On June 28, 2005, NTN entered into a written employment  agreement with its
Chief Executive Officer,  Stanley B. Kinsey,  effective July 1, 2005,  extending
the term of Mr. Kinsey's  employment  through  February 28, 2006. As provided by
the  employment  agreement,  Mr.  Kinsey  shall be paid a salary of $394,000 per
annum  through  February  28, 2006 and shall be eligible to  participate  in the
Company executive bonus program.  The Company also granted Mr. Kinsey options to
purchase  250,000  shares of common stock at $1.88 per share pursuant to the NTN
Communications,  Inc. 2004 Performance Incentive Plan. The options shall vest as
to 1/12 of the total shares as of the last day of each calendar month commencing
July 2005.

In the event of a change of control, any unvested options shall immediately
vest. In addition, in the event of a change of control, both the Company and Mr.
Kinsey shall be entitled to terminate  the  agreement,  which will result in the
payment to Mr. Kinsey equal to one year's additional compensation.  For purposes
of the agreement change in control includes  acquisition of more than 50% of the
outstanding  securities  by a group,  a change of more than half of the  current
Board of Directors,  shareholder  approval of a merger or dissolution or removal
of Mr. Kinsey as Chairman of the Board of Directors.

In addition, upon termination of the agreement by the Company without cause
or for  disability  or upon any attempt by the Board of  Directors to change Mr.
Kinsey's  duties or reassume  any duties or  responsibilities  given to him, Mr.
Kinsey shall be entitled to the greater of one year's additional compensation or
the  compensation  that  was  to  accrue  during  the  balance  of the  term  of
employment.

Mr.  Kinsey and the Company  will  attempt to negotiate an extension of the
agreement by January 1, 2006. If no agreement has been reached by that time, Mr.
Kinsey may request that the Company  extend the  agreement by one year under the
existing terms, along with a 3% compensation increase. If, by February 28, 2006,
the  Company  has not  presented  a  renewal  offer  comparable  to the  current
contract,  Mr. Kinsey may be released from the agreement and will be entitled to
one year's compensation.

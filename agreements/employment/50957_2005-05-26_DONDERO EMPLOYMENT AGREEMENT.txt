EXHIBIT 10





EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT



This
Employment Agreement is made and entered into on April 4, 2005 (the “Effective
Date”) by and between Broyhill Furniture Industries, Inc., a North Carolina
corporation (“Broyhill”) and Harvey Dondero (“Dondero”).



WHEREAS,
Dondero is now employed by Broyhill in a senior management executive position; and



WHEREAS, it
is in the best interests of Broyhill to assure that it will have Dondero’s continued
dedication;



NOW
THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration and in order to induce Dondero to
remain in the employ of Broyhill, the parties covenant and agree as follows:





1.
Definitions.     The
following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Agreement.





a.
“Cause” means (i) an act or acts of personal dishonesty taken
by Dondero and intended to result in Dondero’s substantial personal
enrichment at the expense of Broyhill, (ii) violations by Dondero of this
Agreement or of his employment obligations to Broyhill which are demonstrably
willful on his part and which are not remedied within a reasonable period of
time after receipt of written notice from Broyhill, or (iii) Dondero’s
conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude.








b.
“Disability” means the incapacity to attend to and perform
effectively one’s duties and responsibilities which continues for at least
26 weeks after its commencement, as determined by a physician selected by
Broyhill.








c.
“Employment Period” that period beginning on the Effective
Date and ending upon Dondero’s retirement or earlier termination of
employment.








2.
Employment.     Broyhill agrees to employ Dondero, and Dondero agrees to
serve Broyhill in an executive, managerial and supervisory capacity, subject to
the direction and control of the Board of Directors of Broyhill and of Furniture
Brands International, all upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.
During the Employment Period:





a.
Dondero’s position (including, without limitation, status, offices, titles
and reporting requirements), authority, duties and responsibilities shall be at
least commensurate in all material respects with the most significant of those
held, exercised and assigned at any time during the 90-day period immediately
following the Effective Date,



















b.
Dondero’s services shall be performed at the location where he is employed
on the Effective Date, or at any office or location not more than thirty-five
(35) miles from such location,







c.
Dondero shall continue to receive an annual base salary at least equal to the
annual base salary payable to him by Broyhill on the Effective Date (“Base
Salary”),








d.
Dondero shall continue to have an annual cash bonus potential, either pursuant
to the Broyhill Executive Incentive Plan in effect on the Effective Date or
pursuant to a similar incentive compensation plan of Broyhill, at least equal to
the level in existence on the Effective Date (“Annual Bonus”), and









e.
Dondero shall be entitled to participate in all incentive, savings and
retirement plans, practices, policies and programs applicable to other key
executive employees of Broyhill (“Benefit Plans”).









The failure of Broyhill, without
Dondero’s consent, to comply with the terms and conditions of employment as set forth
in this Section 2 shall constitute “Good Reason” for the termination by Dondero
of his employment with Broyhill.



3.
Best Efforts.     Dondero agrees during the Employment Period to devote his           best
efforts and substantially all of his business time and attention to the
business of Broyhill, it being agreed that he will have complied with this
obligation if he devotes to the business of Broyhill his same best efforts and
the same time and attention to the business of Broyhill that he has devoted to
the business of Broyhill during the four months immediately following the
Effective Date. Dondero agrees that he will perform such other executive duties
for Broyhill and for Broyhill’s subsidiaries relating to its business as
the Board of Directors of Broyhill may reasonably direct.



4.
Term.     Subject
to the provisions of this Section 4 of this Agreement,           either party shall have
the right to terminate the Employment Period at any           time. If Broyhill
terminates Dondero’s employment, other than for Cause or           as a result of
his death or Disability, or if Dondero terminates his employment           with Broyhill
for Good Reason, then Broyhill will, for a period of one year           after the
termination date (or, if shorter, until Dondero reaches “Normal           Retirement
Age” (as such concept is used in the primary retirement plan in           which
Dondero is a participant on the Effective Date)) but in any event through           at
least April 4, 2007, (i) pay to Dondero as and when normally payable his Base
Salary as in effect on the date of termination and an amount equal to the
average Annual Bonus received by him for the past three years prior to
termination, or since the commencement of his employment with Broyhill,
whichever period is the shorter (or a pro-rated portion of such average Annual
Bonus), and (ii) subject to program eligibility requirements and continuation
of           programs by Broyhill, continue his participation in the Benefit Plans in
which           he was participating on the date of termination of employment.













5.
Non-Competition.     During
the period commencing on the Effective Date and           while employed by Broyhill, and
for a period of one year after termination of           employment, Dondero shall not,
without the prior written consent of Broyhill,           directly or indirectly, own,
control, finance, manage, operate, join or           participate in the ownership,
control, financing, management or operation of, or           be connected as an employee,
consultant or in any other
capacity with, any           business engaged in the manufacture or distribution of
residential furniture in           the United States. Nothing in this Section 5 shall,
however, restrict Dondero           from making investments in other ventures which are
not competitive with           Broyhill, or restrict him from owning less than one
percent (1%) of the           outstanding securities of companies listed on a national
stock exchange or           actively traded in the “over-the-counter” market.
In addition, if           Broyhill terminates the Employment Period (other than for
Cause) and Dondero           elects to forego the payments called for in Section 4
hereof, the provisions of           this Section 5 shall not apply. Should any of the
terms of this Section 5 be           found to be unenforceable because they are
over-broad in any respects then they           shall be deemed amended to the extent, and
only to the extent, necessary to           render them enforceable. Both parties
stipulate that money damages would be           inadequate to compensate for any breaches
of the terms of this Section 5, and           that such terms shall be enforceable
through appropriate equitable relief,           without the necessity of proving actual
damages and to an equitable accounting           of all earnings, profits, and other
benefits arising from such violation, which           rights shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other rights and remedies to           which Broyhill may be entitled.



6.
Confidentiality.     During
the Employment Period and at all times           thereafter, Dondero shall maintain the
confidentiality of, and shall not           disclose to any person (except as his duties
as an employee of Broyhill may           require) any non-public information concerning
Broyhill or its business.



7.
Miscellaneous.     This
Employment Agreement shall be binding upon and shall           inure to the benefit of
Dondero’s heirs, executors, administrators and           legal representatives, and
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of           Broyhill and its successors
and assigns. This Agreement shall supersede and           stand in place of any and all
other agreements between Dondero and Broyhill           regarding severance pay and/or
any and all severance pay benefits pursuant to           any plan or practice of
Broyhill. This Employment Agreement shall take effect as           of the day and year
first above set forth, and its validity, interpretation,           construction and
performance shall be governed by the laws of the State of North           Carolina.



8.
Indemnification.     In
the event that either party hereto is required to           pursue litigation against the
other party to enforce his or its rights           hereunder, the prevailing party in any
such litigation shall be entitled to           reimbursement of the costs and expenses of
such litigation, including           attorney’s fees.



9.
Waivers.    In
consideration of the undertakings of Broyhill set forth in           this Agreement,
Dondero hereby irrevocably waives and forever releases any and           all claims and
causes of action of any nature whatsoever that he has or may have           against
Broyhill or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents arising           out of
the negotiation, execution, delivery













or terms of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any claims arising under the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §21 et seq., and any state or local law
relating to age discrimination.




10.
Entire Agreement.     This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the           parties with
respect to its subject matter, and no waiver, modification or           change of any of
its provisions shall be valid unless in writing and signed by           the party against
whom such claimed waiver, modification or change is sought to           be enforced.

This Amendment (the “Amendment”), dated effective as of March 8, 2012, hereby amends the Employment Agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) by and between M.D.C. Holdings, Inc.

1. Double Trigger. Section 4(d)(ii) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(ii) If a Change in Control Event (as defined in Appendix A hereto) shall occur, followed within two years by
a Material Change (as defined in Appendix A hereto), the Executive shall, if he so elects by written notice to the Company within thirty days of a Material Change that is not corrected following notice, be entitled to terminate his employment, if
not already terminated by the Company. In that event, the Executive shall receive the amounts set forth in Section 4(c)(i) and (ii) above, and the Executive shall be entitled to the accelerated vesting of all options and rights as provided
in Section 4(d)(i) above and, at Executive’s election, in the event the Change in Control Event involves a two-tier tender offer, the Company will pay Executive the difference between the exercise price of the otherwise unvested options

lump sum cash payment, an amount equal to the actuarial present value (determined on the basis of the applicable mortality table and applicable interest rate as specified in Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as of the effective
date of the Executive’s termination date) of the Retirement Benefit payments payable to the Executive under Section 3(d), commencing on his termination date, and any such lump sum cash payment to the Executive shall be in complete
discharge of the Company’s obligation with respect to the Executive’s Retirement Benefit.

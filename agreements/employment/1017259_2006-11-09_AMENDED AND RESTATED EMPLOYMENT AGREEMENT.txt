NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

period commencing as of February 14, 2001 (the “Effective Date”) and ending on December 31, 2008, or such shorter period as may be provided for herein, and such term shall be automatically extended by an additional one-year term
in the event that the Company fails to provide written notice of non-renewal of the Agreement to the Executive in accordance with Section 24 not later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the then current employment term (an
“Extension”). The employment term described above, including any Extension, is hereinafter referred to as the “Employment Term”.
2. Section 7 of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

insured basis for (A) each of the Executive’s children who is under the age of 22 at the time of such event, (B) the Executive’s spouse and (C), in the case of clause (ii), the Executive for a period of 24 months following

hereof, normal employee medical and dental insurance benefits shall be continued on an insured basis for (A) each of the Executive’s children who is under the age of 22 at the time of such event and (B) the Executive’s spouse and
(C) the Executive for a period of 12 months following the month in which the Agreement is no longer in effect. Except for the benefits provided in accordance with clause (i) of this Section 7(c), the Executive shall not be entitled to

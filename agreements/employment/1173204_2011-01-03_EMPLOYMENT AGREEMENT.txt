6.           Termination.  (a) The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and the Employee’s employment prior to the expiration of the Term only for “Cause” (as defined below).  The Company shall have no obligations to the Employee for any period subsequent to the effective date of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph 6(a), except any and all obligations provided by law and the payment of Base Salary (pursuant to paragraph 4(a)) up to and including the termination date, bonus earned and approved by the Committee (pursuant to paragraph 4(b)), reimbursement of expenses
incurred prior to the termination date (pursuant to paragraph 4(c)), and benefits accrued prior to the termination date (pursuant to paragraph 5).







(b)           If, prior to the end of the Term, the Company terminates this Agreement and the Employee's employment for any reason other than for Cause or if the Employee resigns for Good Reason (as defined below), the Employee shall be entitled to receive the amounts payable under paragraph 6(a), plus the amount of his Base Salary that would have been paid for the remainder of the Term (collectively referred to herein as “Severance”).   Subject to paragraph 6(f) below, the Severance shall be paid in equal monthly installments, as of the first of each month, beginning with the month following sixty (60) days after such termination provided that the first of such payments would include any amounts that would have been payable absent the 60-day delay in comme
ncement date, and such payments shall continue for the duration of the Term (which payment period is referred to herein as the “Severance Period”).  During the Severance Period, the Employee shall have a duty to seek other employment, but shall not be required to accept any position other than a position (i) as a senior executive officer with the same general responsibilities that the Employee possessed at the Company at the time of commencement of this Agreement, and (ii) with a company equal or larger in earnings and tangible net worth than the Company at the time of the Employee's termination.  The Employee may, however, accept any full-time position at any level and at any salary with any entity, profit or non-profit, and the Employee, by accepting such employment, shall be conclusively deemed to have fulfilled his duty to seek employment under this paragraph 6(b).  The Company shall be entitled to redu
ce the amounts paid under this paragraph 6(b) by the amounts paid to the Employee in the same period by such other entity.







(c)           If, prior to the end of the Term, the Company terminates this Agreement and the Employee’s employment for any reason other than for Cause or if the Employee resigns for Good Reason, in each event within two years after a Change in Control (as defined in the EIP), in lieu of the amount payable under paragraph 6(b), Employee will receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum of his then Base Salary and Target Bonus amount,  multiplied by the greater of (i) two, or (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months remaining in the Term, and the denominator of which is twelve; provided, however, that such payment shall be limited to an amount which would not result in an “excess parachute payment” as that term is defined in Internal R
evenue Code section 280G.  Subject to paragraph 6(f) below, payment of













4


















the amount due under this paragraph 6(c) shall be made as soon as practicable after the termination occurs.







(d)           For purposes of this Agreement, “Cause” means any of the following:  (i) the Employee’s conviction of or plea of nolo contendere to a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude, (ii) the Employee’s material breach of a material provision of this Agreement that is not corrected within thirty (30) days following written notice of such breach sent by the Company to the Employee, (iii) the Employee’s willful misconduct in the performance of his material duties under this Agreement, (iv) the Employee’s performance of his materi
al duties in a manner that is grossly negligent, and (v) the Employee’s failure to attempt to fully comply with any lawful directive of the Board which is not corrected within thirty (30) days following written notice of such breach sent by the Company to the Employee.  Whether or not “Cause” exists shall be determined solely by the Company in its reasonable, good faith discretion.







(e)           For purposes of this Agreement, “Good Reason”  means, without the Employee's written consent,  (i) a material and substantially adverse reduction in title or job responsibilities compared with title or job responsibilities on the Effective Date, but shall not include a change of title and position during the Term to only Chief Executive Officer, (ii) any requirement that the Employee relocate to a work location more than 50 miles from the metropolitan Los Angeles area; or (iii) any material breach of the Agreement by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Good Reason will be deemed to exist only in the event that: (x) the Employee gives written notice to the Company of his claim of Good Reason and the specific grounds for his claim
within ninety (90) days following the occurrence of the event upon which his claim rests, (y) the Company fails to cure such breach within thirty days (30) of receiving such notice (“Cure Period”), and (z) the Employee gives written notice to the Company to terminate his employment within fifteen (15) days following the Cure Period.







(f)           Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Employee is a “specified employee” (as such term is defined in Section 409A) and the provisions of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(i)(2) apply because payments due under this Agreement constitute deferred compensation for purposes of Code Section 409A, payments under this paragraph 6 shall in no event be made prior to six months after the Participant’s separation from service (the “Suspension Period”).  All payments suspended during the Suspension Period will be paid in a lump sum and the normal payment schedule will resume at the end of the Suspension Period.  Each of the affected payments under this paragraph (f) shall be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.








(g)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Employee shall not be entitled to Severance or Change in Control payments under this paragraph 6 unless (i) the Employee materially complies with the restrictive covenants by which he is bound (whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise), including, but not limited to, any non-competition agreement, non-solicitation agreement, confidentiality agreement or invention assignment agreement signed by the Employee, and (ii) the Employee executes, delivers and does not revoke a commercially reasonable general release in form and substance acceptable to both the Company and Employee no later than sixty (60) days following the effective date of termination of employment.

raph 7, Disability shall mean any physical or mental incapacity that is documented by qualified medical experts and that results in the Employee’s inability to perform his essential material duties and responsibilities for the Company, with reasonable accommodation, for a period of ninety (90) days in any consecutive twelve (12) month period, all as determined in the good faith judgment of the Board.

For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change In Control" shall mean the
occurrence of any of the following events:

A third "person," including a "group," but excluding an
existing stockholder of ESI who is the "beneficial
owner" (as these terms are defined in or for the
purposes of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and as in effect on the date
hereof) of more than 20% of the total number of votes
that may be cast for the election of directors of ESI,
(A) becomes the beneficial owner of shares of ESI having
more than 50% of the total number of votes that may be
cast for the election of directors of ESI, or (B)
otherwise is able to appoint, designate or control, by
proxy, agreement or otherwise, a majority of the
directors of ESI;

The merger or consolidation of ESI with or into any
other corporation or entity or the merger or

or consolidation, more than 50% in voting power of the
outstanding capital stock of the surviving corporation;
or

Any sale or transfer in a single transaction or series
of related transactions of more than 50% of fair market
value of ESI's assets.

Notwithstanding the above, ESI and EMPLOYEE acknowledge that this Section
12(b) shall be triggered and EMPLOYEE shall be entitled to severance
thereunder if after execution of a definitive agreement but prior to the
actual closing of a Change in Control, EMPLOYEE is terminated in relation
to the Change in Control.

Payments. Severance payments may be paid in one lump sum or in
installments at the option of EMPLOYEE.

Excess Parachute Payments. If any portion of the payments or benefits
under this Agreement or any other agreement or benefit plan of the Company
(including stock options) would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" to the Employee under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Employee shall be paid any excise
tax that the Employee owes under Section 4999 of the Code as a result of
such characterization, such excise tax to be paid to the Employee at least
ten (10) days prior to the date that he or she is obligated to make the
excise tax payment. The determination of whether and to what extent any

payments or benefits would be "excess parachute payments" and the date by
which any excise tax shall be due, shall be determined by recognized tax
counsel selected by ESI and reasonably acceptable to the Employee.

Except as specifically set forth herein, the Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect. This Amendment shall be governed in all respects by
the internal laws of the state of Idaho (without regard to its conflicts
of laws principles). This Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each
of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute
the same document. This Amendment shall be binding upon, and inure to the
benefit of, the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns.

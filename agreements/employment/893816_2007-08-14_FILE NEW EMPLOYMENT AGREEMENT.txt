agreement is "at will" and calls for an annual salary of $242,050. The Board of

annual adjustments to the salary but may only adjust it upwards, and may grant a
bonus to Mr. McHale, in each case at their sole discretion. Mr. McHale will
receive such other benefits as are generally made available to senior officers
and other employees. In the event Mr. McHale's employment is terminated by the

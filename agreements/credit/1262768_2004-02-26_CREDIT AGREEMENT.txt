the Administrative Agent with respect thereto and all other Loan Documents).

(a) Each reference in the Credit Agreement to “this Agreement,” “hereunder,” “hereof,”
“herein,” or words of like import, and each reference in the other Loan Documents to the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, by means of words like “thereunder”, “thereof” and words of
like import), shall mean and be a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby, and this Amendment and the Credit Agreement shall be read together and construed as a single instrument. Each of the table of contents and lists of Exhibits and
Schedules of the Credit Agreement shall be amended to reflect the changes made in this Amendment as of the Amendment Effective Date or the Tranche B Dollar Loan Reduction Effective Date, as applicable.

the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents are and shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed.

expressly set forth herein.

(d) This Amendment is a Loan

This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Signature pages may be detached from
multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are attached to the same document. Delivery of an executed counterpart by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of

absent manifest error.

Section 13. Successors

The terms of this Amendment shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.

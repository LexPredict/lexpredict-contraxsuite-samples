SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Borrower represents and warrants, and such representations and warranties
shall be deemed to be continuing representations and warranties during the
entire life of this Agreement, and so long as Bank shall have any commitment or
obligation to make any Loans or issue any Letters of Credit hereunder, and so
long as any Indebtedness remains unpaid and outstanding under any Loan Document,
as follows:

3.1 Authority. Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and
is duly qualified and authorized to do business in each other jurisdiction in
which the character of its assets or the nature of its business makes such
qualification necessary.

3.2 Due Authorization. Each Loan Party has all requisite power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each Loan
Document to which it is a party or is otherwise bound, all of which have been
duly authorized by all necessary action, and are not in contravention of law or
the terms of any Loan Party's organizational or other governing documents.

3.3 Title to Property. Each Loan Party has good title to all property and
assets purported to be owned by it, including those assets identified on the
Financial Statements most recently delivered by Borrower to Bank.

3.4 Encumbrances. There are no security interests or other Liens or
encumbrances on, and no financing statements on file with respect to, any of the
property or assets of any Loan Party, except for Permitted Encumbrances.

3.5 Subsidiaries. Borrower has no Subsidiaries, except as set forth in
Schedule 3.5 which Schedule sets forth the percentage of ownership of Borrower
in each such Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement.

3.6 Taxes. Each Loan Party has filed, on or before their respective due
dates, all federal, state, local and foreign tax returns which are required to
be filed, or has obtained extensions for filing such tax returns, and is not
delinquent in filing such returns in accordance with such extensions, and has
paid all taxes which have become due pursuant to those returns or pursuant to
any assessments received by any such party, as the case may be, to the extent
such taxes have become due, except to the extent such tax payments are being
actively and diligently contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and
if requested by Bank, have been bonded or reserved in an amount and manner
satisfactory to Bank.

3.7 No-Defaults. There exists no default (or event which, with the giving
of notice or passage of time, or both, would result in a default) under the
provisions of any instrument or agreement evidencing, governing, securing or
otherwise relating to any Debt of any Loan Party or pertaining to any of the
Permitted Encumbrances.

3.8 Enforceability of Agreement and Loan Documents. Each Loan Document has
been duly executed and delivered by duly authorized officer(s) or other
representative(s) of each Loan Party, and constitutes the valid and binding
obligations of each Loan Party, enforceable in accordance with their respective

2

<PAGE>


terms, except to the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally at the time in effect.

3.9 Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by each Loan
Party of the Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party or otherwise
bound, are not in contravention of the terms of any indenture, agreement or
undertaking to which any such Loan Party is a party or by which it is bound,
except to the extent that such terms have been waived or that failure to comply
with any such terms would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.10 Actions, Suits, Litigation or Proceedings. There are no actions,
suits, litigation or proceedings, at law or in equity, and no proceedings before
any arbitrator or by or before any Governmental Authority, pending, or, to the
best knowledge of Borrower, threatened against or affecting any Loan Party,
which, if adversely determined, could materially impair the right of any Loan
Party to carry on its business substantially as now conducted or could have a
Material Adverse Effect. No Loan Party is under investigation by, or is
operating under any restrictions imposed by, any Governmental Authority.

3.11 Compliance with Laws. Each Loan Party has complied with all
Governmental Requirements, including, without limitation, Environmental Laws, to
the extent that failure to so comply could have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.12 Consents, Approvals and Filings. Except as have been previously
obtained or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no authorization,
consent, approval, license, qualification or formal exemption from, nor any
filing, declaration or registration with, any Governmental Authority and no
material authorization, consent or approval from any other Person, is required
in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of
any Loan Document to which it is a party. All such authorizations, consents,
approvals, licenses, qualifications, exemptions, filings, declarations and
registrations which have previously been obtained or made, as the case may be,
are in full force and effect and are not the subject of any attack, or to the
knowledge of Borrower, any threatened attack, in any material respect, by
appeal, direct proceeding or otherwise.

3.13 Contracts, Agreements and Leases. To Borrower's knowledge, no Loan
Party is in default (beyond any applicable period of grace or cure) in complying
with any provision of any material contract, agreement, indenture, lease or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or
assets are bound, where such default would have a Material Adverse Effect. To
Borrower's knowledge, each material contract, commitment, undertaking,
agreement, indenture and instrument is in full force and effect and is valid and
legally binding.

3.14 ERISA. Except as shown on Schedule 3.14, no Loan Party maintains or
contributes to any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.
Furthermore, no Loan Party has incurred any accumulated funding deficiency
within the meaning of ERISA or incurred any liability to the PBGC in connection
with any employee benefit plan established or maintained by such Loan Party, and
no reportable event or prohibited transaction, as defined in ERISA, has occurred
with respect to such plans.

3.15 No Investment Company. No Loan Party is an "investment company" within
the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, nor is any Loan
Party "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

<PAGE>


3.16 No Margin Stock. No Loan Party is engaged principally, or as one of
its important activities, directly or indirectly, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock, and none of the
proceeds of any of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, to purchase
or carry any margin stock or made available by any Loan Party in any manner to
any other Person to enable or assist such Person in purchasing or carrying
margin stock, or otherwise used or made available for any other purpose which
might violate the provisions of Regulations G, T, U, or X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Terms for which meanings are provided
in Regulation U of said Board of Governors or any regulations substituted
therefor, as are from time to time in effect, are used in this Section with such
meanings, and these representations and warranties shall be immediately
effective.

3.17 Environmental Representations.

(a) No Loan Party has received any notice of any violation of any
Environmental Law(s); and no Loan Party is a party to any litigation or
administrative proceeding, nor, so far as is known by Borrower, is any
litigation or administrative proceeding threatened against any Loan Party
which, in any case, (i) asserts or alleges that any Loan Party violated any
Environmental Law(s), (ii) asserts or alleges that any Loan Party is
required to clean up, remove or take any other remedial or response action
due to the disposal, depositing, discharge, leaking or other release of any
Hazardous Materials, or (iii) asserts or alleges that any Loan Party is
required to pay all or a portion of any past, present or future clean-up,
removal or other remedial or response action which arises out of or is
related to the disposal, depositing, discharge, leaking or other release of
any Hazardous Materials by any Loan Party, and which, either singularly or
in the aggregate, could have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) To Borrower's knowledge, there are no conditions existing
currently which could subject any Loan Party to damages, penalties,
injunctive relief or clean-up costs under any applicable Environmental
Law(s), or which require, or are likely to require, clean-up, removal,
remedial action or other response pursuant to any applicable Environmental
Law(s) by any Loan Party, and which, in any case, either singularly or in
aggregate, could have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) No Loan Party is subject to any judgment, decree, order or
citation related to or arising out of any applicable Environmental Law(s),
which, either singularly or in the aggregate, could have a Material Adverse
Effect; and, to Borrower's knowledge, no Loan Party has been named or
listed as a potentially responsible party by any Governmental Authority in
any matter arising under any applicable Environmental Law(s), except as
disclosed in Schedule 3.17, and, in the event that any such matters are
disclosed in said Schedule 3.17 they will not, either singularly or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Each Loan Party has all permits, licenses and approvals required
under applicable Environmental Laws, where the failure to so obtain or
maintain any such permits, licenses or approvals could have a Material
Adverse Effect.

3.18 Accuracy of Information. The Financial Statements previously furnished
to Bank have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present the
financial condition of Borrower and, as applicable, the consolidated financial
condition of Borrower and such other Person(s) as such Financial Statements
purport to present, and the results of their respective operations as of the
dates and for the periods covered thereby; and since the date(s) of said
Financial Statements, there has been no material adverse change in the financial
condition of Borrower or any other Person covered by such Financial Statements.
No Loan Party, nor any such other Person has any material contingent
obligations, liabilities for taxes, long-term leases or long-term commitments
not disclosed by, or reserved against in, such Financial Statements. Each Loan
Party is solvent, able to pay its respective debts as they mature, has capital
sufficient to carry on its business and has assets the fair market value of
which exceed its liabilities, and no Loan Party will be rendered insolvent,
under-capitalized or unable to pay debts generally as they become due by the
execution or performance of any Loan Document to which it is a party or by which
it is otherwise bound.

3.19 Reserved.

3.20 Intellectual Property . Borrower and each Loan Party own or have
rights to use all Intellectual Property necessary to continue to conduct their
respective businesses as now or heretofore conducted or proposed to be
conducted, and each patent, trademark, copyright and license held by Borrower or
such other Loan Party is listed, together with application or registration,
numbers, as applicable, on Schedule 3.20. Neither the Borrower nor any such
other Loan Party is a party to any license or other agreement that restricts
such Person from granting Bank a Lien upon any of such Person's rights under
license or agreement. Borrower and each Loan Party conduct their respective
businesses and affairs without infringement upon or interference with any
Intellectual Property of any other Person.

SECTION 4. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

Borrower covenants and agrees that, so long as Bank is committed to make
any Loan or issue any Letter of Credit under this Agreement, and until all
instruments and agreements evidencing any Loan which is payable on demand or
which conditions advances upon the Bank's discretion are fully discharged and
terminated, and thereafter, so long as any Indebtedness remains outstanding, it
will, and, as applicable, it will cause each Loan Party within its control or
under common control to:

4.1 Preservation of Existence. Preserve and maintain its existence and

to conduct and operate its business substantially as conducted and operated
during the present and preceding calendar year; at all times maintain, preserve
and protect all of its franchises and trade names and preserve all the remainder

4.8 Indemnification. Indemnify, defend and save Bank harmless from any and
all claims, losses, costs, damages, liabilities, obligations and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees (whether inside or
outside counsel is used), incurred by Bank by reason of any Default or Event of

customarily carried by companies similar in size and nature (including, without
limitation, loss of rent and/or business interruption insurance and boiler and
machinery insurance), and in the event of acquisition of additional property,
real or personal, or of the incurrence of additional risks of any nature,
increase such insurance coverage in such manner and to such extent as prudent
business judgment and present practice would dictate; and in the case of all
policies covering property subject to any Loan Document or property in which the

of any Loan Party set forth in any Loan Document and continuation thereof
beyond any applicable period of grace or cure provided with respect
thereto;

(e) any default by any Loan Party, in the payment of any Debt (other
than Debt owing to Bank), or in the observance or performance of any
conditions, covenants or agreements related or given with respect thereto
and, in each such case, continuation thereof beyond any applicable grace or
cure period;

(f) the rendering of one or more judgments or decrees for the payment

<PAGE>


(g) the failure by any Loan Party, to meet the minimum funding
requirements under ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan established or
maintained by it; the occurrence of any "reportable event", as defined in
ERISA, which could constitute grounds for termination by the PBGC of any
Pension Plan or for the appointment by the appropriate United States
District Court of a trustee to administer such Pension Plan, and such
reportable event is not corrected and such determination is not revoked
within thirty (30) days after notice thereof has been given to the plan
administrator or any Loan Party, as the case may be; or the institution of
any proceedings by the PBGC to terminate any such Pension Plan or to
appoint a trustee by the appropriate United States District Court to
administer any such Pension Plan;

(h) if any Loan Party, becomes insolvent or generally fails to pay, or
admits in writing its inability to pay, its debts as they mature, or
applies for, consents to, or acquiesces in the appointment of a trustee,
receiver, liquidator, conservator or other custodian for any Loan Party, or
a substantial part of its property, or makes a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors; or in the absence of such application, consent or
acquiescence, a trustee, receiver, liquidator, conservator or other
custodian is appointed for any Loan Party, or for a substantial part of its
property, and the same is not discharged within thirty (30) days; or any
bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement, or other proceedings under

against any Loan Party, the same is consented to or acquiesced in by any
such Loan Party or otherwise remains undismissed for thirty (30) days; or
any warrant of attachment is issued against any substantial part of the
property of any Loan Party, which is not released within thirty (30) days
of service thereof; or

(i) if any Loan Document shall be terminated, revoked, or otherwise
rendered void or unenforceable, in any case, without Bank's prior written
consent.

6.2 Remedies Upon Event of Default. Upon the occurrence and at any time
during the existence or continuance of any Event of Default, but without
impairing or otherwise limiting the Bank's right to demand payment of all or any
portion of the Indebtedness which is payable on demand, at Bank's option, Bank
may give notice to Borrower declaring all or any portion of the Indebtedness
remaining unpaid and outstanding, whether under the Notes or otherwise, to be
due and payable in full without presentation, demand, protest, notice of
dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived, whereupon all such
Indebtedness shall immediately become due and payable. Furthermore, upon the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default and at any time during the existence
or continuance of any Default or Event of Default, but without impairing or
otherwise limiting the right of Bank, if reserved under any Loan Document, to
make or withhold financial accommodations at its discretion, to the extent not
yet disbursed, any commitment by Bank to make any further loans to Borrower or
issue any further Letters of Credit for Borrower's account under this Agreement

14

<PAGE>


shall automatically terminate; provided, should such Default or Event of Default
be cured to Bank's satisfaction, Bank may, but shall be under no obligation to,
reinstate any such commitment by written notice to Borrower. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default under Section 6.1(i), and
notwithstanding the lack of any notice, demand or declaration by Bank, the
entire Indebtedness remaining unpaid and outstanding shall become automatically
due and payable in full, and any commitment by Bank to make any further loans to
Borrower or issue any further Letters of Credit for Borrower's account shall be
automatically and immediately terminated, without any requirement of notice or
demand by Bank upon Borrower, each of which are hereby expressly waived by
Borrower. The foregoing rights and remedies are in addition to any other rights,
remedies and privileges Bank may otherwise have or which may be available to it,
whether under this Agreement, any other Loan Document, by law, or otherwise.

6.3 Setoff. In addition to any other rights or remedies of Bank under any
Loan Document, by law or otherwise, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance or existence of any Event of Default, Bank may, at any time and from
time to time, without notice to Borrower (any requirements for such notice being
expressly waived by Borrower), setoff and apply against any or all of the
Indebtedness (whether or not then due), any or all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by Borrower and other
indebtedness at any time owing by Bank to or for the credit or for the account
of Borrower, and any property of Borrower, from time to time in possession or
control of Bank, irrespective of whether or not Bank shall have made any demand
hereunder or for payment of the Indebtedness and although such obligations may
be contingent or unmatured, and regardless of whether any Collateral then held
by Bank is adequate to cover the Indebtedness. The rights of Bank under this
Section are in addition to any other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of setoff) which Bank may otherwise have. Borrower
hereby grants Bank a Lien on and security interest in all such deposits,
indebtedness and other property as additional collateral for the payment and
performance of the Indebtedness.

6.4 Waiver of Certain Laws. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
Borrower hereby agrees to waive, and does hereby absolutely and irrevocably
waive and relinquish, the benefit and advantage of any valuation, stay,
appraisement, extension or redemption laws now existing or which may hereafter
exist, which, but for this provision, might be applicable to any sale made under
the judgment, order or decree of any court, on any claim for interest on the
Notes, or to any security interest or other Lien contemplated by or granted
under or in connection with this Agreement or the Indebtedness.

6.5 Waiver of Defaults. No Default or Event of Default shall be waived by
Bank except in a written instrument specifying the scope and terms of such
waiver and signed by an authorized officer of Bank, and such waiver and shall be
effective only for the specific time(s) and purpose(s) given. No single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder, nor any delay in
the exercise thereof, shall preclude other or further exercise of Bank's rights.
No waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall extend to any other or
further Default or Event of Default. No forbearance on the part of Bank in
enforcing any of Bank's rights or remedies under any Loan Document shall
constitute a waiver of any of its rights or remedies. Borrower expressly agrees
that this Section may not be waived or modified by Bank by course of
performance, estoppel or otherwise.

6.6 Receiver. Bank, in any action or suit to foreclose upon any of the
Collateral, shall be entitled, without notice or consent, and completely without
regard to the adequacy of any security for the Indebtedness, to the appointment
of a receiver of the business and premises in question, and of the rents and
profits derived therefrom. This appointment shall be in addition to any other
rights, relief or remedies afforded Bank. Such receiver, in addition to any
other rights to which he shall be entitled, shall be authorized to sell,
foreclose or complete foreclosure on Collateral for the benefit of Bank,
pursuant to provisions of applicable law.

15

<PAGE>


6.7 Discretionary Credit and Credit Payable Upon Demand. To the extent that
any of the Indebtedness shall, at anytime, be payable upon demand, nothing
contained in this Agreement, or any other Loan Document, shall be construed to
prevent Bank from making demand, without notice and with or without reason, for
immediate payment of all or any part of such Indebtedness at any time or times,
whether or not a Default or Event of Default has occurred or exists. In the
event that such demand is made upon any portion of the Indebtedness, the Bank,
at its election, may terminate any commitment by Bank to make any further loans
to Borrower or issue any further Letters of Credit for Borrower's account under
this Agreement or otherwise. Furthermore, to the extent any Loan Document
authorizes the Bank, at its discretion, to make or to decline to make financial
accommodations to the Borrower, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document shall be construed to limit or impair such discretion or to commit
or otherwise obligate the Bank to make any such financial accommodation.

6.8 Application of Proceeds of Collateral. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in any Loan Document, after an Event of Default, the proceeds
of any of the Collateral, together with any offsets, voluntary payments, and any
other sums received or collected in respect of the Indebtedness, may be applied
in such order and manner as determined by Bank in its sole and absolute
discretion.

SECTION 7. MISCELLANEOUS

7.1 Accounting Principles. Except to the extent expressly stated to the
contrary herein, where the character or amount of any asset or liability or item
of income or expense is required to be determined, or any consolidation or other
accounting computation is required to be made for purposes of this Agreement, it
shall be done in accordance with GAAP, and all accounting terms not specifically
defined in this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with GAAP.

7.2 Taxes and Fees. Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, should
any tax (other than a tax based upon the net income of Bank) or recording or
filing fee become payable in respect of any Loan Document, any of the
Collateral, any of the Indebtedness or any amendment, modification or supplement
hereof or thereof, Borrower agrees to pay such taxes (or reimburse Bank therefor
upon demand for reimbursement), together with any interest or penalties thereon,
and agrees to hold Bank harmless with respect thereto.

7.3 Governing Law. Each Loan Document shall be deemed to have been
delivered in the State of Texas, and shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, except to the extent
that the Uniform Commercial Code, other personal property law or real property
law of another jurisdiction where Collateral is located is applicable, and
except to the extent expressed to the contrary in any Loan Document. Whenever
possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner
as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this
Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision
shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.

7.4 Audits of Collateral; Fees. Bank shall have the right from time to time
to audit Accounts and Inventory pledged by any Loan Party and other Collateral,
provided that such audits will be conducted no more than one (1) time in any
fiscal year unless an Event of Default has occurred. Borrower agrees to

16

<PAGE>


reimburse Bank, on demand, for customary and reasonable fees and costs incurred
by Bank for such audits and for each appraisal of Collateral and financial
analysis and examination of Borrower or any other Loan Party performed from time
to time.

7.5 Costs and Expenses. Borrower shall pay Bank, on demand, all costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and legal
expenses (whether inside or outside counsel is used), incurred by Bank in
perfecting, revising, protecting or enforcing any of its rights or remedies
against any Loan Party or any Collateral, or otherwise incurred by Bank in
connection with any Default or Event of Default or the enforcement of the Loan
Documents or the Indebtedness. Following Bank's demand upon Borrower for the
payment of any such costs and expenses, and until the same are paid in full, the
unpaid amount of such costs and expenses shall constitute Indebtedness and shall
bear interest at the Default Rate.

7.6 Notices. All notices and other communications provided for in any Loan
Document (unless otherwise expressly stipulated therein) or contemplated
thereby, given thereunder or required by law to be given, shall be in writing
(unless expressly provided to the contrary). If personally delivered, such
notices shall be effective when delivered, and in the case of mailing or
delivery by overnight courier, such notices shall be effective when placed in an
envelope and deposited at a post office or official depository under the
exclusive care and custody of the United States Postal Service or delivered to
an overnight courier, postage prepaid, in each case addressed to the parties as
set forth on the signature page of this Agreement, or to such other address as a
party shall have designated to the other in writing in accordance with this
Section. In the case of mailing, the mailing shall be by certified or first
class mail. The giving of at least five (5) days' notice before Bank shall take
any action described in any notice shall conclusively be deemed reasonable for
all purposes; provided, that this shall not be deemed to require Bank to give
such five (5) days' notice, or any notice, if not specifically required to do so
in this Agreement.

7.7 Further Action. Borrower, from time to time, upon written request of
Bank, will promptly make, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be made,
executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such further and additional
instruments, and promptly take all such further action as may be reasonably
required to carry out the intent and purpose of the Loan Documents, and to
provide for the Loans thereunder and payment of the Notes, according to the
intent and purpose therein expressed.

7.8 Successors and Assigns; Participation. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of Borrower and Bank and their respective
successors and assigns. The foregoing shall not authorize any assignment or
transfer by Borrower, of any of its respective rights, duties or obligations
hereunder, such assignments or transfers being expressly prohibited. Bank,
however, may freely assign, whether by assignment, participation or otherwise,
its rights and obligations hereunder, and is hereby authorized to disclose to
any such assignee or participant (or proposed assignee or participant) any
financial or other information in its knowledge or possession regarding any Loan
Party or the Indebtedness.

7.9 Indulgence. No delay or failure of Bank in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents shall affect such
right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any further exercise thereof, nor the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege available to Bank. The rights and remedies of Bank hereunder
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies of Bank.

17

<PAGE>


7.10 Amendment and Waiver. No amendment or waiver of any provision of any
Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall
in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
Bank, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance(s) and for the specific time(s) and purpose(s) for which given.

7.11 Severability. In case any one or more of the obligations of any Loan
Party under any Loan Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
obligations of such Loan Party shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby, and such invalidity, illegally or unenforceability in one jurisdiction
shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the obligations of
such Loan Party under any Loan Document in any other jurisdiction.

7.12 Headings and Construction of Terms. The headings of the various
sub-Sections hereof are for convenience of reference only and shall in no way
modify or affect any of the terms or provisions hereof. Where the context herein
requires, the singular number shall include the plural, and any gender shall
include any other gender.

7.13 Independence of Covenants. Each covenant hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted
by any such covenant, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or
would be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid
the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

7.14 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions. All terms, covenants,
agreements, representations and warranties of any Loan Party made in any Loan
Document, or in any certificate, report, financial statement or other document
furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party in connection with any Loan
Document, shall be deemed to have been relied upon by Bank, notwithstanding any
investigation heretofore or hereafter made by Bank or on Bank's behalf, and
those covenants and agreements of Borrower set forth in Sections 4.8 and 4.12
hereof (together with any other indemnities of Borrower contained elsewhere in
any Loan Document) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
repayment in full of the Indebtedness.

7.15 Effective Upon Execution. This Agreement shall become effective upon
the execution hereof by Bank and Borrower, and shall remain effective until the
Indebtedness under this Agreement and each of the Notes and the related Loan
Documents shall have been repaid and discharged in full and no commitment to
extend any credit hereunder (whether optional or obligatory) remains
outstanding.

7.16 Complete Agreement; Conflicts. The Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties thereto, and none of the parties shall be bound by
anything not expressed in writing. In the event that and to the extent that any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any of the other Loan Documents are
inconsistent with or in conflict with any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of this Agreement, the applicable terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall govern and control.

7.18 Separate Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to the extent the loan agreement or
promissory note which evidences a specified portion of the Indebtedness (herein
referred to as a "Separate Loan"), or any security agreement, mortgage, deed of
trust or other document which specifically secures such Separate Loan
(collectively referred to as the "Separate Loan Documents"), expressly
stipulates that the Separate Loan shall only be secured by specifically
identified collateral or that the collateral described in the Separate Loan
Documents shall not secure any Indebtedness other than the Separate Loan, the
applicable provisions of the Separate Loan Documents shall control. Furthermore,
to the extent any Separate Loan Document expressly stipulates that a default or
event of default under the Loan Documents shall not, unless otherwise expressly
stipulated in a Separate Loan Document, constitute a default or event of default
with respect to the Separate Loan, the applicable provisions of the Separate
Loan Documents shall control.

7.19 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BANK AND BORROWER EACH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

1.7 Non-Application of Chapter 346 of Texas Finance Code. The provisions of
Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code are specifically declared by the parties
not to be applicable to any of the Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby.

1.8 Unused Commitment Fee. Borrower shall pay to Bank an unused commitment
fee in an amount equal to the product of (a) 0.25% multiplied by (b) the
difference between (i) the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount and (ii) the
aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans and Letter of

LTCPA-2

<PAGE>


Credit Liabilities. Such fee shall be computed on a daily basis and shall be
payable quarterly in arrears as of the end of each of Borrower's fiscal
quarters. Bank shall invoice Borrower for such fees, which invoice shall be due
and payable within fifteen (15) days after receipt.

1.9 Letters of Credit.

(a) Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Bank shall, upon request from
Borrower from time to time prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date,
issue one or more Letters of Credit. The Letter of Credit Liabilities shall
not exceed $500,000; and the sum of (i) the outstanding principal balance
of all Revolving Loans plus (ii) the Letter of Credit Liabilities shall not
exceed the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount. Letters of Credit may be issued
to finance working capital needs. Each Letter of Credit issued pursuant to
this Agreement shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000. No Letter of Credit
shall have a stated expiration date later than thirty (30) days prior to
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

(b) Additional Provisions. The following additional provisions shall
apply to each Letter of Credit:

(i) Borrower shall give the Bank written notice requesting each
issuance of a Letter of Credit hereunder not less than three (3)
Business Days prior to the requested issuance date and shall furnish
such additional information regarding such transaction as Bank may
request. The issuance by Bank of each Letter of Credit shall, in
addition to the conditions precedent set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, be subject to the conditions precedent that (A) such Letter
of Credit shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Bank, (B)
Borrower shall have executed and delivered such applications and other
instruments and agreements relating to such Letter of Credit as Bank
shall have requested and are not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement (C) each of the statements in Section 1.3(d)(i), (ii), (iv),
(v) and (vi) of this Loan Terms, Conditions and Procedures Addendum
are true as of the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit with
respect to issuance of such Letter of Credit (as opposed to making a
Revolving Loan), and the submission of an application for issuance of
a Letter of Credit shall constitute a representation, warranty and
certification of Borrower to that effect and (D) no Letter of Credit
may be issued if after giving effect thereto, the sum of the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans plus the Letter
of Credit Liabilities would exceed the Revolving Credit Maximum
Amount. With respect to the issuance or renewal of each Letter of
Credit, Borrower shall pay to Bank such letter of credit fees and
other expenses customarily charged by Bank in connection with the
issuance or renewals of letters of credit.

(ii) Borrower shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated
forthwith to reimburse Bank for any amount paid by Bank upon any
drawing under any Letter of Credit, without presentment, demand,
protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby
waived. Unless Borrower shall elect to otherwise satisfy such
Reimbursement Obligation, such reimbursement shall, subject to

LTCPA-3

<PAGE>


satisfaction of any conditions provided herein for the making of
Revolving Loans and to the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount,
automatically be made by advancing to Borrower a Revolving Loan in the
amount of such Reimbursement Obligation.

(c) Indemnification; Release. Borrower hereby indemnifies and agrees
to defend and hold harmless Bank and its officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives from and against any and all claims and damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which any such indemnified party may
incur (or which may be claimed against Bank or any such indemnified party
by any person whatsoever), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART
BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, in connection with the
execution and delivery of any Letter of Credit or transfer of or payment or
failure to pay under any Letter of Credit; provided that Borrower shall not
be required to indemnify any party seeking indemnification for any claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to
the extent, caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the
party seeking indemnification, or (ii) by the failure by the party seeking
indemnification to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to
it of a request required to be paid under applicable law.

SECTION 2. FUNDING LOANS, PAYMENTS, RECOVERIES AND COLLECTIONS

2.1 Funding Loans. Subject to the satisfaction of all conditions precedent
to the making and funding of any Loan set forth in any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, those conditions precedent set forth in Section 5 of this
Addendum, Bank shall make the proceeds of any such Loan available to Borrower by
11:00 a.m. (Houston, Texas time) on the respective Disbursement Date of such
Loan, by depositing such proceeds into such account maintained by Borrower with
Bank as Borrower shall designate in writing or as otherwise agreed to in writing
by Borrower and Bank.

2.2 Bank's Books and Records. The amount and date of each Loan hereunder,
the amount from time to time outstanding under each Note, the Applicable
Interest Rate in respect of each Loan, and the amount and date of any repayment
hereunder or under any of the Notes, shall be noted on Bank's books and records,
which shall be conclusive evidence thereof, absent manifest error; provided,
however, any failure by Bank to make any such notation, or any error in any such
notation, shall not relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay to Bank all
amounts owing to Bank under or pursuant to the Loan Documents, in each case,
when due in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof.

2.3 Payments on Non-Business Day. In the event that any payment of any
principal, interest, fees or any other amounts payable by Borrower under or
pursuant to any Loan Document shall become due on any day which is not a
Business Day, such due date shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day, and, to the extent applicable, interest shall continue to accrue and be
payable at the Applicable Interest Rate(s) for and during any such extension.

2.4 Payment Procedures. Unless otherwise expressly provided in a Loan
Document, all sums payable by Borrower to Bank under or pursuant to any Loan
Document, whether principal, interest, or otherwise, shall be paid, when due,
directly to Bank at the office of Bank identified on the signature page of this

LTCPA-4

<PAGE>


Agreement, or at such other office of Bank as Bank may designate in writing to
Borrower from time to time, in immediately available United States funds, and
without setoff, deduction or counterclaim. Bank may, in its discretion, charge
any and all deposit or other accounts (including, without limitation, any
account evidenced by a certificate of deposit or time deposit) of Borrower
maintained with Bank for all or any part of any Indebtedness then due and
payable; provided, however, that such authorization shall not affect Borrower's
obligations to pay all Indebtedness, when due, whether or not any such account
balances maintained by Borrower with Bank are insufficient to pay any amounts
then due,

2.5 Maximum Interest Rate. At no time shall any Applicable Interest Rate or
Default Rate under this Agreement or any Note, or otherwise in respect of any
Loan or any Indebtedness hereunder, exceed the Maximum Legal Rate, giving due
consideration to the execution of this Agreement and each Note. In the event
that any interest is charged or otherwise received by Bank in excess of the
Maximum Legal Rate, Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that any such excess
interest shall be the result of an accidental and bona fide error, and any such
excess shall be deemed to have been payments of principal, and not of interest,
and shall be applied, first, to reduce the principal Indebtedness then
outstanding, second, any remaining excess, if any, shall be applied to reduce
any other Indebtedness, and third, any remaining excess, if any, shall be
returned to Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, but subject to all
limitations contained in this paragraph, if at anytime any Applicable Interest
Rate or Default Rate or other rate of interest applicable to any portion of the
Indebtedness is computed on the basis of the Maximum Legal Rate, any subsequent
reduction in the Applicable Interest Rate, Default Rate or such other rate of
interest shall not reduce such interest rate thereafter payable below the
Maximum Legal Rate until the aggregate amount of interest accrued equals the
total amount of interest that would have accrued if interest had, at all times,
been computed solely on the basis of the Applicable Interest Rate, Default Rate
or such other interest rate. This paragraph shall control all agreements between
the Borrower and the Bank.

2.6 Receipt of Payments by Bank. Any payment by Borrower of any of the
Indebtedness made by mail will be deemed tendered and received by Bank only upon
actual receipt thereof by Bank at the address designated for such payment,
whether or not Bank has authorized payment by mail or in any other manner, and
such payment shall not be deemed to have been made in a timely manner unless
actually received by Bank on or before the date due for such payment, time being
of the essence. Borrower expressly assumes all risks of loss or liability
resulting from non-delivery or delay of delivery of any item of payment
transmitted by mail or in any other manner. Acceptance by Bank of any payment in
an amount less than the amount then due shall be deemed an acceptance on account
only, and any failure to pay the entire amount then due shall constitute and
continue to be an Event of Default hereunder. Bank shall be entitled to exercise
any and all rights and remedies conferred upon and otherwise available to Bank
under any Loan Document upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
such Event of Default. Prior to the occurrence of any Default, Borrower shall
have the right to direct the application of any and all payments made to Bank
hereunder to the Indebtedness evidenced by the respective Notes. Borrower waives
the right to direct the application of any and all payments received by Bank
hereunder at any time or times after the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Default. Borrower further agrees that after the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Default, or prior to the occurrence of any Default if
Borrower has failed to direct such application, Bank shall have the continuing

LTCPA-5

<PAGE>


exclusive right to apply and to reapply any and all payments received by Bank at
any time or times, whether as voluntary payments, proceeds from any Collateral,
offsets, or otherwise, against the Indebtedness in such order and in such manner
as Bank may, in its sole discretion, deem advisable, notwithstanding any entry
by Bank upon any of its books and records. Borrower hereby expressly agrees
that, to the extent that Bank receives any payment or benefit of or otherwise
upon any of the Indebtedness, and such payment or benefit, or any part thereof,
is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside, or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other Person
under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law, equitable cause or
otherwise, then to the extent of such payment or benefit, the Indebtedness, or
part thereof, intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if such payment or benefit had not been made or received by
Bank, and, further, any such repayment by Bank shall be added to and be deemed
to be additional Indebtedness.

2.7 Security. Payment and performance of the Indebtedness shall be secured
by Liens on all of the assets and properties of Borrower and of such other Loan
Parties as Bank may require from time to time and shall be guaranteed by the
Guarantors.

time to time specify), not later than 10:00 am., Chicago time, on the date due.
The Administrative Agent shall have the authority to debit such account for the
amount of any payments due in order to effect each such payment. Funds received
after 11:30 a.m., Chicago time, shall be deemed to have been received by the
Administrative Agent on the next following Business Day (unless such failure to
receive funds in a timely fashion is due to the Administrative Agent's failure
to debit the Borrower's account).

SECTION 3.5 Due Date Extension. If any payment of principal or
interest with respect to the Loans falls due on a day which is not a Business
Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next following Business Day,

with this Agreement or the Loan Documents is then due or (b) any Unmatured Event
of Default pursuant to Section 10.1.5 or Event of Default exists, each Lender,
the Administrative Agent or any Participant may apply to the payment of such
payment or other amount any and all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or

moneys of the Borrower then or thereafter with such Lender, the Administrative
Agent or any Participant; provided, that, any proceeds or recoveries obtained by

any portion of the principal amount of any Loan as, or to convert any Loan into,
a Eurodollar Loan shall be, upon such determination (and telephonic notice
thereof, confirmed in writing, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower),
forthwith suspended until such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent that
the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and all Eurodollar
Loans shall automatically convert into Alternate Reference Rate Loans; provided,
however, that each Lender shall take any reasonable actions available to it

in the interbank eurodollar market; or

principal amount of any Loan as, or to convert any portion of any Loan into,
Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent
shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that each Lender shall take any
reasonable actions available to it (including the designation of its lending
office) consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions that will avoid the

ARTICLE VI

INCREASED COSTS AND OTHER SPECIAL PROVISIONS

SECTION 6.1 Increased Costs. If, after the date hereof, any Regulatory
Change, or compliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental
Authority, shall subject the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Included
Tax or capital adequacy requirement with respect to, or shall otherwise increase
the effective cost of the Loans or such Lender's obligation to make, issue or
maintain the Loans (except for taxes, duties or similar charges including any
interest or penalties thereon which do not constitute Included Taxes), or shall
impose on a Lender any other condition, except with respect to taxes, duties or
similar charges including any interest or penalties thereon which do not
constitute Included Taxes, affecting the Loan, or such Lender's obligation to
make the Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
any Lender of making, issuing or maintaining the Loans, or to reduce the amount
of, or any rate of return on, any sum received or receivable by such Lender
under this Agreement or under the Note with respect thereto, then upon written
notice of such occurrence to the Borrower by such Lender (which notice shall
contain a statement setting forth a description of such occurrence and shall be
signed by an authorized officer of such Lender), the Borrower shall pay directly
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such increased cost or such reduction; provided, however, that each Lender
shall take any reasonable actions available to it (including the designation of
a different lending office) consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions
that will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and
will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

SECTION 6.2 Payment for Credits. If the Borrower is required pursuant
to Section 6.1 to pay and pays a Lender for any increased costs or any reduction
of any rate of return, and if such Lender, in good faith, determines that it has
received or been granted a credit against or relief or remission for or
repayment of any tax paid or payable by it, it shall, to the extent that it
could do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit,
relief, remission or repayment, pay to the Borrower such amount as such Lender
shall, in good faith, have determined to be attributable to such payment by the
Borrower.

SECTION 6.3 Certificate Requirements. Each Lender that is not an
entity organized under the laws of the United States shall deliver to the
Borrower (with a copy to the

24
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent) an accurate and complete original signed copy of an
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 properly claiming complete exemption
from withholding, within thirty days of the signing of this Agreement, and shall
promptly deliver such additional or supplemental forms thereafter as may be
required in order to maintain the effectiveness and accuracy of such forms. In
addition, each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower such other forms or
documentation as the Borrower may reasonably request in order to comply with the
United States tax laws.

SECTION 6.4 General Funding Losses. The Borrower hereby agrees that
upon demand by the Administrative Agent (which demand shall be accompanied by a
statement signed by an authorized officer of the Administrative Agent setting
forth the basis for the calculations of the amount being claimed) the Borrower
will indemnify such Lender against any loss or expense which each Lender may
sustain or incur as reasonably determined by such Lender in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 6.4, as a result of any failure of the Borrower to
borrow, continue, convert or repay any Loan on a date specified therefor in a
notice (whether written or oral) of borrowing continuation, conversion or
repayment pursuant to this Agreement. For the purposes of this Section 6.4 such
loss or expense for each Lender shall include an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (a) its cost of obtaining in the interbank eurodollar market the funds
for the Loans being repaid or not borrowed for the period from the date of such
prepayment or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current Interest
Period for such Loans (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest
Period for such Loans that would have commenced on the date of such failure)
over (b) the amount of interest that such Lender would have earned had it
invested the entire amount of funds so prepaid or the entire amount of funds
acquired to effect, fund or maintain the Loans not borrowed, at the Federal
Funds Rate. For this purpose, all notices to a Lender or the Administrative
Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be irrevocable.

SECTION 6.5 Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender
shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or its portion of the
Loans in any manner it sees fit; provided, however, that each Lender shall take
any reasonable actions available to it (including the designation of its lending
office) consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions that will avoid
increased cost to the Borrower and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Lender.

SECTION 6.6 Conclusiveness of Statements: Survival of Provisions. In
making the determinations contemplated by this Article VI, the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders may make such

25
<PAGE>

reasonable estimates, assumptions, allocations and the like that the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders in good faith determine to be appropriate.
Upon making any determination pursuant to this Article VI, the Administrative
Agent shall provide the Borrower with a certificate signed by an authorized
officer of the Administrative Agent setting forth any estimates, assumptions,
allocations or other similar calculations made by the Administrative Agent in
connection with such determination. Subject to the foregoing, determinations and
statements of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to this Article
VI and any certificates delivered in connection therewith shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. The provisions of this Article VI shall survive
termination of this Agreement.


ARTICLE VII

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make Loans
hereunder, the Borrower represents and warrants to each Lender that:

SECTION 7.1 Due Organization, Authorization, etc. Each of the Borrower
and each Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation, (b) is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where,
because of the nature of its activities or properties, such qualification is
required, which jurisdictions are set forth with respect to the Borrower and
each Subsidiary on Schedule 7.1, (c) has the requisite corporate power and
authority and the right to own and operate its properties, to lease the property
it operates under lease, and to conduct its business as now and proposed to be
conducted, and (d) has obtained all material licenses, permits, consents or
approvals from or by, and has made all filings with, and given all notices to,
all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction, to the extent required for
such ownership, operation and conduct (including, without limitation, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) as to each of
the foregoing except where the failure to do so would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Borrower, or on the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby are within its corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action (including, without limitation, shareholder approval,
if required). Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has received all
material governmental and other consents and approvals (if any shall be
required) necessary for such execution, delivery and performance,


26
<PAGE>

and such execution, delivery and performance do not and will not contravene or
conflict with, or create a Lien or right of termination or acceleration under,
any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation binding upon the Borrower or
such Subsidiaries.  This Agreement and each of the Loan Documents is (or when
executed and delivered will be) the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the
Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its respective
terms; provided that the Borrower assumes for purposes of this Section 7.1 that
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents have been validly executed and
delivered by each of the parties thereto other than the Borrower.

SECTION 7.2 Statutory Financial Statements. (a) The Annual Statement
of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, the
provisions made therein for investments and the valuation thereof, reserves,
policy and contract claims and Statutory Liabilities) as filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authority of its state of domicile (the "Department")
and delivered to each Lender prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, as of and for the 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995 Fiscal Years, and
as of and for the Fiscal Quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 1996
(collectively, the "Statutory Financial Statements"), have been prepared in
accordance with SAP applied on a consistent basis (except as noted therein).
Each such Statutory Financial Statement was in material compliance with
applicable law when filed. The Statutory Financial Statements fairly present the

financial position of each such Insurance Subsidiary as of and for the
respective dates and periods indicated therein in accordance with SAP applied on
a consistent basis, except as set forth in the notes thereto or on Schedule
7.2(a). Except for liabilities and obligations, including, without limitation,
reserves, policy and contract claims and Statutory Liabilities (all of which
have been computed in accordance with SAP), disclosed or provided for in the
Statutory Financial Statements, the Insurance Subsidiaries did not have, as of
the respective dates of each of such financial statements, any material
liabilities or obligations (whether absolute or contingent and whether due or to
become due) which, in conformity with SAP, applied on a consistent basis, would
have been required to be or should be disclosed or provided for in such
financial statements. All books of account of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries
fully and fairly disclose all of the transactions, properties, assets,
investments, liabilities and obligations of such Insurance Subsidiary and all of
such books of account are in the possession of each such Insurance Subsidiary
and are true, correct and complete in all material respects.

in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Department with
respect to each such Insurance Subsidiary as well as those of any other
applicable jurisdiction relating to investments in respect of which it may
invest its funds.

any other applicable jurisdiction, and have been computed in accordance with
SAP.

applicable law.

adverse change in the business, assets, operations or financial condition of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary which has had or could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Borrower, or on the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole since September 30, 1996.

end adjustments) consolidated or unconsolidated, as the case may be results of

quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments.

SECTION 7.4 Litigation and Contingent Liabilities. (a) Except as set
forth (including estimates of the dollar amounts involved) in Schedule 7.4
hereto and (b) except for claims which are covered by Insurance Policies,

departments), permits or authorizations to transact insurance and reinsurance
business (collectively, the "Licenses") is the subject of a proceeding for
suspension or revocation or any similar proceedings, there is no sustainable

THE AGENTS

SECTION 11.1  Authorization.  Each Lender authorizes the
Administrative Agent to act on behalf of such Lender as Administrative Agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers to the extent provided herein or in any
document or instrument delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, and to
take such other action as may be reasonably incidental thereto.  As to matters
not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
enforcement or collection of this Agreement or any other Loan Document) the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion, but shall
be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so
acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders
and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and Holders.  Under no
circumstances shall the Administrative Agent have any fiduciary duties to any
Lender or be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent
to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or to the Loan
Documents or applicable law.  Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
written notice, report or financial statement delivered by the Borrower as
required


47
<PAGE>

pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall forward a copy
thereof to each Lender.

SECTION 11.2  Liability of the Administrative Agent.  None of the
Agent-Related Persons nor any of their directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under
or in connection with this Agreement and the Loan Documents, except for its or
their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent (a) may treat a Lender as
such until the Administrative Agent receives an executed Assignment Agreement
entered into between a Lender and an Eligible Assignee pursuant to Section 12.1
hereof; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for the Borrower),
independent public accountants and other experts or consultants selected by it;
(c) shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the advice of counsel,
accountants, consultants or experts; (d) make no warranty or representation to
any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals,
statements, warranties or representations, whether written or oral, made in or
in connection with this Agreement or the Loan Documents; (e) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the terms, obligations, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of
the Borrower or to inspect the property (including, without limitation, any
books and records) of the Borrower; (f) shall not be responsible to any Lender
for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any Loan Document or any other document
furnished in connection with any of the foregoing; and (g) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any Loan Document by action
upon any written notice, statement, certificate, order, telephone message,
facsimile or other document which the Administrative Agent believes in good
faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the
proper person.

SECTION 11.3  Indemnification.  Each Lender agrees to, ratably in
accordance with its Voting Percentage, indemnify the Agent-Related Persons (to
the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including
fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel), claim, demand, action, loss or
liability (except as to the Agent-Related Persons such as result from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent-Related Persons) that the Agent-
Related Persons may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement, the Note,
the Loan Documents and any documents or certificates delivered in connection
therewith or any action taken or omitted by the Agent-Related Persons hereunder
or thereunder.


48
<PAGE>

SECTION 11.4  Administrative Agent.  With respect to the Loans made by
it, any Agent-Related Person shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though its Affiliate were not the Administrative Agent; and the term
"Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include such
financial institutions in their individual capacities.  Each Lender and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower
and any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own
securities of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary, all as if such Lender or its
Affiliate were not the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lenders.

SECTION 11.5  Credit Investigation.  Each Lender acknowledges that it
(i) has made such inquiries and taken such care on its own behalf as would have
been the case had the Loan been made directly by such Lender to the Borrower
without the intervention of any Agent-Related Person, and (ii) will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement.  Each Lender agrees and acknowledges that no Agent-Related
Person makes any representations or warranties about the creditworthiness of the
Borrower or with respect to the legality, validity, sufficiency or
enforceability of this Agreement, the Note, the Loan Documents or security
therefor.

SECTION 11.6  Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.
Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender or the Borrower
(any such party being herein called the "Payor") prior to the date on which such
Payor is to make payment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of the Loan
to be made by it hereunder (in the case of a Lender) or such Payor is to make a
payment hereunder or under the Note to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the Lenders (in the case of the Borrower), as the case may be (such payment
being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice shall be effective
upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make the Required Payment to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Required
Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not
be required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient on
such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to the
Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment (and, if such recipient is
the Borrower and the Lender which is the Payor fails to pay the amount thereof
to the Administrative Agent forthwith upon such demand, the


49
<PAGE>

Borrower) shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount made
available to it, together with interest thereon in respect of each day during
the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the
Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such
amount, at a rate per annum equal to (a) in the case of the Borrower, the
Default Rate, provided, if the Borrower has to repay such amount through no
fault of its own, the Borrower shall pay the Reference Rate and (b) in the case
of a Lender, for the first 3 Business Days the rate set by interbank custom and
practice for the correction of errors among banks and for every day thereafter,
the Default Rate.

SECTION 11.7  Successor Agents.  The Administrative Agent may resign
at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and may be removed
at any time with cause by the Required Lenders.  Upon any such resignation or
removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Administrative Agent.  If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment
within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of
notice of resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring
Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of
the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a
commercial bank having a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations in its capacity as
Administrative Agent under this Agreement.  After any retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions
of this Article XI shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.


ARTICLE XII

ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS

SECTION 12.1  Assignments.

12.1.1  Each Lender shall have the right at any time to assign to any
Eligible Assignee, subject (except in the case of an Eligible Assignee (i)
that is controlled by the same bank holding company as the assigning Lender
and (ii) which has combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000)


50
<PAGE>

approval will not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood that among
the criteria to be considered would be the financial condition of the
Eligible Assignee), all or any part of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement and each Loan Document including its rights in respect
of its Loans and the Note; provided that the aggregate number of bank
holding companies represented by all Lenders hereunder shall not exceed
twelve (12) at any time.  Any such assignment shall be pursuant to an
assignment agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit F (an
"Assignment Agreement"), duly executed by such Lender and the Eligible
Assignee, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent.  Although its
failure to do so will not affect any of the rights or obligations provided
for therein or herein, the Borrower agrees to duly acknowledge any
Assignment Agreement executed by any assigning Lender promptly after its
receipt of the same.

12.1.2  Each assignment shall be pro rata with respect to all rights
and obligations of the assigning Lender including the Loans and the Note.
Each assignment, if to a Person other than a Lender, shall be in an amount
equal to or in excess of $5,000,000.  No assignment shall require the
Borrower to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission or apply to qualify any of the Loans or the Note, or any
interest in any thereof, under the "blue sky" or other securities law of
any jurisdiction.  In the case of any such assignment (upon the fulfillment
of the conditions in Section 12.1.3), this Agreement shall be deemed to be
amended to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the
addition of such Eligible Assignee, and the Eligible Assignee shall for all
purposes be a Lender party hereto and shall have, to the extent of such
assignment, the same rights and obligations as a Lender hereunder.

12.1.3  An assignment shall become effective hereunder when all of the
following shall have occurred:  (a) the Assignment Agreement shall have
been executed by the parties thereto, (b) the Assignment Agreement shall
have been acknowledged by the Administrative Agent and, to the extent
required by Section 12.1.1, by the Borrower, (c) either the assigning
Lender or the Eligible Assignee shall have paid a processing fee of
$3,000.00 to the Administrative Agent for its own account, and (d) the
assigning Lender and the Administrative Agent shall have agreed upon a date
upon which the Assignment shall become effective.  Upon the Assignment
becoming effective, the Administrative Agent shall forward all payments of
interest, principal, fees and other amounts that would have been made to
the assigning

51
<PAGE>

Lender, in proportion to the percentage of the assigning Lender's rights
transferred, to the Eligible Assignee.

12.1.4  Upon the effectiveness of any assignment, the assigning Lender
shall be relieved from its obligations hereunder to the extent of the
obligations so assigned (except to the extent, if any, that the Borrower,
any other Lender or the Administrative Agent has rights against such
assigning Lender as a result of any default by such Lender under this
Agreement).  Promptly following the consummation of each assignment, the
Administrative Agent shall furnish to the Borrower and each Lender a
revised Schedule 2.1 and Schedule 13.3, revised to reflect such assignment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender
may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement including its Loans to a Federal Reserve Bank.  No such
assignment shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations
hereunder.

SECTION 12.2  Participations.

12.2.1  Each Lender may grant participations (the "Participations") in
all or any part of its Loans and the Note to any commercial bank or other
financial institution (other than insurance companies and Affiliates
thereof) (the "Participants").  A Participant shall not have any rights
under this Agreement or any other document delivered in connection herewith
(the Participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such
Participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such
Lender in favor of the Participant relating thereto, which agreement with
respect to such Participation shall not restrict such Lender's ability to
make any modification, amendment or waiver to this Agreement without the
consent of the Participant except that the consent of such Participant may
be required in connection with any extension of the stated maturity date of
the Loans, or any scheduled mandatory reduction of the Commitment Amount,
reduction of the interest rate, fees or commissions on, any Loans in which
such Participation was sold or forgiveness of any principal of or interest,
fees or commissions payable on any Loans in which such Participation was
sold.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Participant shall have the
rights of a Lender pursuant to Section 3.6.  All amounts payable by the
Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if the Lender had not
sold such Participation.  In the event of any such sale by a Lender of
participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely
responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall

52
<PAGE>

remain the holder of any obligation for all purposes under this Agreement,
and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement.

12.2.2  Limitation of Rights of any Participant.  Notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (a) no Participant shall have
any direct rights hereunder, (b) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
and the Lenders, other than the assigning or selling Lender, shall deal
solely with the assigning or selling Lender and shall not be obligated to
extend any rights or make any payment to, or seek any consent of, the
Participant, (c) no Participation shall relieve the assigning or selling
Lender of any of its other obligations hereunder and such Lender shall
remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, and (d) no
Participant, other than an affiliate of the assigning or selling Lender,
shall be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action
hereunder, except that such Lender may agree with such Participant that
such Lender will not, without Participant's consent, take any action which
would, affect any principal, interest or fee in which the Participant has
an ownership or beneficial interest.

12.2.3  Any Lender may, in connection with any Assignment or
Participation or proposed Assignment or Participation pursuant to Sections
12.1 and 12.2, and disclose to the Assignee or Participant or proposed
Assignee or Participant any information relating to the Borrower furnished
to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided, that prior to any
such disclosure, the Assignee or Participant or proposed Assignee or
Participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential
information relating to the Borrower received by it from such Lender to the
same extent as the Lenders hereunder.

remedy preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.  No amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent

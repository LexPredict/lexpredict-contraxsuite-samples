CREDIT
AGREEMENT



THIS
CREDIT
AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), is entered into as of May 31,
2007, by and among the lenders identified on the signature pages hereof (such
lenders, together with their respective successors and permitted assigns,
are
referred to hereinafter each individually as a “Lender” and collectively
as the “Lenders”), WELLS FARGO FOOTHILL, INC., a
California corporation, as the arranger and administrative agent for the
Lenders
(in such capacity, together with its successors and assigns in such capacity,
“Agent”), and TELTRONICS, INC., a Delaware corporation
(“Borrower”).



The
parties
agree as follows:



1.  DEFINITIONS
AND CONSTRUCTION.

1.1  Definitions.  Capitalized
terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings specified therefor on
Schedule 1.1.



1.2  Accounting
Terms.  All accounting terms not
specifically defined herein shall be construed in accordance with
GAAP.  When used herein, the term “financial statements” shall include
the notes and schedules thereto.  Whenever the term “Borrower” is used
in respect of a financial covenant or a related definition, it shall be
understood to mean Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis,
unless
the context clearly requires otherwise.



1.3  Code.  Any
terms used in this Agreement that are defined in the Code shall be construed
and
defined as set forth in the Code unless otherwise defined herein;
provided, however, that to the extent that the Code is used to
define any term herein and such term is defined differently in different
Articles of the Code, the definition of such term contained in Article 9
of the
Code shall govern.



1.4  Construction.  Unless
the context of this Agreement or any other Loan Document clearly requires
otherwise, references to the plural include the singular, references to the
singular include the plural, the terms “includes” and  “including” are
not limiting, and the term “or” has, except where otherwise indicated, the
inclusive meaning represented by the phrase “and/or.”  The words
“hereof,” “herein,” “hereby,” “hereunder,” and similar terms in this Agreement
or any other Loan Document refer to this Agreement or such other Loan Document,
as the case may be, as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement or such other Loan Document, as the case may be.  Section,
subsection, clause, and exhibit references herein are to this Agreement unless
otherwise specified.  Schedule references herein are to the Disclosure
Statement unless otherwise specified.  Any reference in this Agreement
or in any other Loan Document to any agreement, instrument, or document shall
include all alterations, amendments, changes, extensions, modifications,
renewals, replacements, substitutions, joinders, and supplements, thereto
and
thereof, as applicable (subject to any restrictions on such alterations,
amendments, changes, extensions, modifications, renewals, replacements,
substitutions, joinders, and supplements set forth herein).  Any
reference herein or in any other Loan Document to the satisfaction or repayment
in full of the Obligations shall mean the repayment in full in cash (or,
in the
case of Letters of Credit or Bank Products, the cash collateralization or
support by a standby letter of credit in accordance with the terms hereof)
of
all Obligations other than unasserted contingent indemnification Obligations
and
other than any Bank Product Obligations that, at such time, are allowed by
the
applicable Bank Product Provider to remain outstanding and that are not required
by the provisions of this Agreement to be repaid or cash
collateralized.  Any reference herein to any Person shall be construed
to include such Person’s successors and assigns.  Any requirement of a
writing contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be satisfied
by the
transmission of a Record and any Record so transmitted shall constitute a
representation and warranty as to the accuracy and completeness of the
information contained therein.

1.5  Schedules
and Exhibits.  All of the schedules and
exhibits attached to this Agreement and the Disclosure Statement shall be
deemed
incorporated herein by reference.



2.  LOAN
AND TERMS OF PAYMENT.



2.1  Revolver
Advances.



(a)  Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and during the term of this
Agreement, each Lender with a Revolver Commitment agrees (severally, not
jointly
or jointly and severally) to make advances (“Advances”) to Borrower in an
amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of
an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Maximum Revolver Amount
less the Letter of Credit Usage at such time, and (ii) the
Borrowing
Base at such time less the Letter of Credit Usage at such
time.



(b)  Anything
to the contrary in this Section 2.1 notwithstanding, Agent shall have the
right to establish reserves against the Borrowing Base in such amounts, and
with
respect to such matters, as Agent in its Permitted Discretion shall deem
necessary or appropriate, including reserves with respect to (i) sums that
Borrower or its Subsidiaries are required to pay under any Section of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (such as taxes, assessments, insurance
premiums, or, in the case of leased assets, rents or other amounts payable
under
such leases) and has failed to pay, and (ii) amounts owing by Borrower or
its
Subsidiaries to any Person to the extent secured by a Lien on, or trust over,
any of the Collateral (other than a Permitted Lien), which Lien or trust,
in the
Permitted Discretion of Agent likely would have a priority superior to the
Agent’s Liens (such as Liens or trusts in favor of landlords, warehousemen,
carriers, mechanics, materialmen, laborers, or suppliers, or Liens or trusts
for
ad valorem, excise, sales, or other taxes where given priority under
applicable law) in and to such item of the Collateral.

(c)  Amounts
borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.1 may be repaid and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, reborrowed at any time during the
term
of this Agreement.  The outstanding principal amount of the Advances,
together with interest accrued thereon, shall be due and payable on the Maturity
Date or, if earlier, on the date on which they are declared due and payable
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.



2.2  Term
Loan.  Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date each Lender with a Term
Loan
Commitment agrees (severally, not jointly or jointly and severally) to make
term
loans (collectively, the “Term Loan”) to Borrower in an amount equal to
such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan Amount.  The principal
of the Term Loan shall be repaid on the following dates and in the following
amounts:






Date


Installment
Amount



July
1, 2007 and the first day of each month thereafter


$97,366.67










The
outstanding unpaid principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest
on the
Term Loan shall be due and payable on the earliest of (i) the Maturity Date,
(ii) the date of the acceleration of the Term Loan in accordance with the
terms
hereof, and (iii) the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(c).  All principal of, interest on, and other
amounts payable in respect of the Term Loan shall constitute
Obligations.  Borrower may make voluntary prepayments of principal
with respect to the Term Loan from time to time so long as: (i) Borrower
provides Agent not less than 3 Business Days prior written notice of such
prepayment, and (ii) the amount of any prepayment is in a minimum amount
of
$100,000 and integral multiples thereof, or the remaining principal balance
of
the Term Loan, if less.  Any such voluntary





BN
1225807v9




2


















prepayments
shall be applied to installments due thereunder in the inverse order of their
maturity.  Amounts repaid under the Term Loan may not be
reborrowed.  Any voluntary prepayment of the Term Loan made pursuant
to this Section 2.2 shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the
principal amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment.



2.3  Borrowing
Procedures and Settlements.



(a)  Procedure
for Borrowing.  Each Borrowing shall be made by an
irrevocable written request by an Authorized Person delivered to
Agent.  Unless Swing Lender is not obligated to make a Swing Loan
pursuant to Section 2.3(b) below, such notice must be received by Agent
no later than 10:00 a.m. (California time) on the Business Day that is the
requested Funding Date specifying (i) the amount of such Borrowing, and (ii)
the
requested Funding Date, which shall be a Business Day; provided,
however, that if Swing Lender is not obligated to make a Swing Loan
as to
a requested Borrowing, such notice must be received by Agent no later than
10:00
a.m. (California time) on the Business Day prior to the date that is the
requested Funding Date.  At Agent’s election, in lieu of delivering
the above-described written request, any Authorized Person may give Agent
telephonic notice of such request by the required time.  In such
circumstances, Borrower agrees that any such telephonic notice will be confirmed
in writing within 24 hours of the giving of such telephonic notice, but the
failure to provide such written confirmation shall not affect the validity
of
the request.



(b)  Making
of Swing Loans.  In the case of a request for an Advance and
so long as either (i) the aggregate amount of Swing Loans made since the
last
Settlement Date, minus the amount of Collections or payments applied to Swing
Loans since the last Settlement Date, plus the amount of the requested Advance
does not exceed $2,000,000, or (ii) Swing Lender, in its sole discretion,
shall
agree to make a Swing Loan notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, Swing
Lender shall make an Advance in the amount of such Borrowing (any such Advance
made solely by Swing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) being
referred to as a “Swing Loan” and such Advances being referred to
collectively as “Swing Loans”) available to Borrower on the Funding Date
applicable thereto by transferring immediately available funds to Borrower’s
Designated Account.  Each Swing Loan shall be deemed to be an Advance
hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions applicable
to
other Advances, except that all payments on any Swing Loan shall be payable
to
Swing Lender solely for its own account.  Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.3(d)(ii), Swing Lender shall not make and shall not be
obligated to make any Swing Loan if Swing Lender has actual knowledge that
(i)
one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3
will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable
Borrowing, or (ii) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability
on such
Funding Date.  Swing Lender shall not otherwise be required to
determine whether the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section
3 have been satisfied on the Funding Date applicable thereto prior to
making
any Swing Loan.  The Swing Loans shall be secured by the Agent’s
Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate
applicable from time to time to Advances that are Base Rate Loans.



(c)  Making
of Loans.



(i)  In
the
event that Swing Lender is not obligated to make a Swing Loan, then promptly
after receipt of a request for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.3(a),
Agent shall notify the Lenders, not later than 1:00 p.m. (California time)
on
the Business Day immediately preceding the Funding Date applicable thereto,
by
telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of the requested
Borrowing.  Each Lender shall make the amount of such Lender’s Pro
Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately
available funds, to Agent’s Account, not later than 10:00 a.m. (California time)
on the Funding Date applicable thereto.  After Agent’s receipt of the
proceeds of such Advances, Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available
to
Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by transferring immediately available
funds equal to such proceeds received by Agent to the Designated Account;
provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of Section
2.3(d)(ii), Agent shall not request any Lender to make, and no Lender shall








BN
1225807v9




3
















have
the
obligation to make, any Advance if Agent shall have actual knowledge that
(1)
one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3
will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing
unless such condition has been waived, or (2) the requested Borrowing would
exceed the Availability on such Funding Date.



(ii)  Unless
Agent receives notice from a Lender prior to 9:00 a.m. (California time)
on the
date of a Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available as and when
required hereunder to Agent for the account of Borrower the amount of that
Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has
made or will make such amount available to Agent in immediately available
funds
on the Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to Borrower on such date a corresponding
amount.  If and to the extent any Lender shall not have made its full
amount available to Agent in immediately available funds and Agent in such
circumstances has made available to Borrower such amount, that Lender shall
on
the Business Day following such Funding Date make such amount available to
Agent, together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day
during
such period.  A notice submitted by Agent to any Lender with respect
to amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive, absent manifest
error.  If such amount is so made available, such payment to Agent
shall constitute such Lender’s Advance on the date of Borrowing for all purposes
of this Agreement.  If such amount is not made available to Agent on
the Business Day following the Funding Date, Agent will notify Borrower of
such
failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrower shall pay such amount
to
Agent for Agent’s account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed
since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest
rate
applicable at the time to the Advances composing such Borrowing.  The
failure of any Lender to make any Advance on any Funding Date shall not relieve
any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make an Advance on such Funding
Date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender
to
make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on any Funding
Date.



(iii)  Agent
shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made
by
Borrower to Agent for the Defaulting Lender’s benefit, and, in the absence of
such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments
to each other non-Defaulting Lender member of the Lender Group ratably in
accordance with their Commitments (but only to the extent that such Defaulting
Lender’s Advance was funded by the other members of the Lender Group) or, if so
directed by Borrower and if no Default or Event of Default had occurred and
is
continuing (and to the extent such Defaulting Lender’s Advance was not funded by
the Lender Group), retain same to be re-advanced to Borrower as if such
Defaulting Lender had made Advances to Borrower.  Subject to the
foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its Permitted Discretion, re-lend to Borrower
for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such payments
received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting
Lender.  Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters
with respect to the Loan Documents, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed
not
to be a “Lender” and such Lender’s Commitment shall be deemed to be
zero.  This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Lender
until (x) the Obligations under this Agreement shall have been declared or
shall
have become immediately due and payable, (y) the non-Defaulting Lenders,
Agent,
and Borrower shall have waived such Defaulting Lender’s default in writing, or
(z) the Defaulting Lender makes its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Advance
and
pays to Agent all amounts owing by Defaulting Lender in respect
thereof.  The operation of this Section shall not be construed to
increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or
excuse
the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties
and
obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by Borrower
of
its duties and obligations hereunder to Agent or to the Lenders other than
such
Defaulting Lender.  Any such failure to fund by any Defaulting Lender
shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement
and shall entitle Borrower at its option, upon written notice to Agent, to
arrange for a substitute Lender to assume the Commitment of such Defaulting
Lender, such substitute Lender to be acceptable to Agent.  In
connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting
Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees
to
execute and deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance in favor
of
the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed
and
delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject only to being repaid
its
share of the outstanding







BN
1225807v9




4
















Obligations
(other than Bank Product Obligations, but including an assumption of its
Pro
Rata Share of the Risk Participation Liability) without any premium or penalty
of any kind whatsoever; provided, however, that any such
assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed
to
constitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups’ or Borrower’s rights or
remedies against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation
to
such failure to fund.



(d)  Protective
Advances and Optional Overadvances.



(i)  Agent
hereby is authorized by Borrower and the Lenders, from time to time in Agent’s
sole discretion, (A) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a
Default or an Event of Default, or (B) at any time that any of the other
applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 are not satisfied,
to make Advances to Borrower on behalf of the Lenders that Agent, in its
Permitted Discretion deems necessary or desirable (1) to preserve or protect
the
Collateral, or any portion thereof, (2) to enhance the likelihood of repayment
of the Obligations
(other than the Bank Product Obligations), or (3) to pay any other amount
chargeable to Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including
Lender
Group Expenses and the costs, fees, and expenses described in Section 9
(any of the Advances described in this Section 2.3(d)(i) shall be
referred to as “Protective Advances”).



(ii)  Any
contrary provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, the Lenders hereby
authorize Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, and either Agent or Swing
Lender, as applicable, may, but is not obligated to, knowingly and
intentionally, continue to make Advances (including Swing Loans) to Borrower
notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or thereby would be created, so
long
as (A) after giving effect to such Advances, the outstanding Revolver Usage
does
not exceed the Borrowing Base by more than $2,000,000, and (B) after giving
effect to such Advances, the outstanding Revolver Usage (except for and
excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender
Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount.  In the
event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the Revolver Usage exceeds the
amounts
permitted by the immediately foregoing provisions, regardless of the amount
of,
or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as
practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional) intentional
Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account
for
interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) unless Agent determines that prior
notice would result in imminent harm to the Collateral or its value), and
the
Lenders with Revolver Commitments thereupon shall, together with Agent, jointly
determine the terms of arrangements that shall be implemented with Borrower
intended to reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding principal amount
of the Advances to Borrower to an amount permitted by the preceding
sentence.  In such circumstances, if any Lender with a Revolver
Commitment objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any
Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented
according to the determination of the Required Lenders.  Each Lender
with a Revolver Commitment shall be obligated to settle with Agent as provided
in Section 2.3(e) for the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any
unintentional Overadvances by Agent reported to such Lender, any intentional
Overadvances made as permitted under this Section 2.3(d)(ii), and any
Overadvances resulting from the charging to the Loan Account of interest,
fees,
or Lender Group Expenses.



(iii)  Each
Protective Advance and each Overadvance shall be deemed to be an Advance
hereunder, except that prior to Settlement therefor all payments on the
Protective Advances shall be payable to Agent solely for its own
account.  The Protective Advances and Overadvances shall be repayable
on demand, secured by the Agent’s Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and
bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Advances that are
Base
Rate Loans.  The provisions of this Section 2.3(d) are for the
exclusive benefit of Agent, Swing Lender, and the Lenders and are not intended
to benefit Borrower in any way.



(e)  Settlement.  It
is agreed that each Lender’s funded portion of the Advances is intended by the
Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the outstanding
Advances.  Such agreement notwithstanding, Agent, Swing Lender, and
the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall





BN
1225807v9




5


















not
be
for the benefit of Borrower) that in order to facilitate the administration
of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among the Lenders
as to
the Advances, the Swing Loans, and the Protective Advances shall take place
on a
periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:



(i)  Agent
shall request settlement (“Settlement”) with the Lenders on a weekly
basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by Agent (1) on behalf
of
Swing Lender, with respect to the outstanding Swing Loans, (2) for itself,
with
respect to the outstanding Protective Advances, and (3) with respect to
Borrower’s or its Subsidiaries’ Collections or payments received, as to each by
notifying the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of
transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. (California
time) on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested
Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the “Settlement
Date”).  Such notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary
statement of the amount of outstanding Advances, Swing Loans, and Protective
Advances for the period since the prior Settlement Date.  Subject to
the terms and conditions contained herein (including Section
2.3(c)(iii)):  (y) if a Lender’s balance of the Advances
(including Swing Loans and Protective Advances) exceeds such Lender’s Pro Rata
Share of the Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective Advances) as
of a
Settlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. (California
time)
on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to a Deposit
Account of such Lender (as such Lender may designate), an amount such that
each
such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the Settlement
Date,
its Pro Rata Share of the Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective
Advances), and (z) if a Lender’s balance of the Advances (including Swing Loans
and Protective Advances) is less than such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the
Advances (including Swing Loans and Protective Advances) as of a Settlement
Date, such Lender shall no later than 12:00 p.m. (California time) on the
Settlement Date transfer in immediately available funds to the Agent’s Account,
an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount,
have
as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances (including
Swing
Loans and Protective Advances).  Such amounts made available to Agent
under clause (z) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against
the amounts of the applicable Swing Loans or Protective Advances and, together
with the portion of such Swing Loans or Protective Advances representing
Swing
Lender’s Pro Rata Share thereof, shall constitute Advances of such
Lenders.  If any such amount is not made available to Agent by any
Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by
the
terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled to recover for its account such amount
on
demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting
Lender
Rate.



(ii)  In
determining whether a Lender’s balance of the Advances, Swing Loans, and
Protective Advances is less than, equal to, or greater than such Lender’s Pro
Rata Share of the Advances, Swing Loans, and Protective Advances as of a
Settlement Date, Agent shall, as part of the relevant Settlement, apply to
such
balance the portion of payments actually received in good funds by Agent
with
respect to principal, interest, fees payable by Borrower and allocable to
the
Lenders hereunder, and proceeds of Collateral.  To the extent that a
net amount is owed to any such Lender after such application, such net amount
shall be distributed by Agent to that Lender as part of such next
Settlement.



(iii)  Between
Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent Protective Advances or Swing Loans
are
outstanding, may pay over to Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, any
Collections or payments received by Agent that in accordance with the terms
of
this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Advances, for
application to the Protective Advances or Swing Loans.  Between
Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no Protective Advances or Swing Loans
are
outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lender any Collections or payments received
by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied
to the reduction of the Advances, for application to Swing Lender’s Pro Rata
Share of the Advances.  If, as of any Settlement Date, Collections or
payments of Borrower or its Subsidiaries received since the then immediately
preceding Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lender’s Pro Rata Share of
the Advances other than to Swing Loans, as provided for in the previous
sentence, Swing Lender shall pay to Agent for the accounts of the Lenders,
and
Agent shall pay to the Lenders, to be applied to the outstanding Advances
of
such Lenders, an amount such that each Lender shall, upon receipt of such
amount, have, as of





BN
1225807v9




6


















such
Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Advances.  During the
period between Settlement Dates, Swing Lender with respect to Swing Loans,
Agent
with respect to Protective Advances, and each Lender (subject to the effect
of
agreements between Agent and individual Lenders) with respect to the Advances
other than Swing Loans and Protective Advances, shall be entitled to interest
at
the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount
of
funds employed by Swing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders, as
applicable.



(f)  Notation.  Agent
shall record on its books the principal amount of the Advances (or portion
of
the Term Loan, as applicable) owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans
owing to Swing Lender, and Protective Advances owing to Agent, and the interests
therein of each Lender, from time to time and such records shall, absent
manifest error, conclusively be presumed to be correct and
accurate.



(g)  Lenders’
Failure to Perform.  All Advances (other than Swing Loans and
Protective Advances) shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.  It is understood that (i) no
Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform
its
obligation to make any Advance (or other extension of credit) hereunder,
nor
shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result
of any
failure by any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii)
no
failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any
other Lender from its obligations hereunder.



2.4  Payments.



(a)  Payments
by Borrower.



(i)  Except
as
otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by Borrower shall be made
to
Agent’s Account for the account of the Lender Group and shall be made in
immediately available funds, no later than 11:00 a.m. (California time) on
the
date specified herein.  Any payment received by Agent later than 11:00
a.m. (California time) shall be deemed to have been received on the following
Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue
until
such following Business Day.



(ii)  Unless
Agent receives notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment
is
due to the Lenders that Borrower will not make such payment in full as and
when
required, Agent may assume that Borrower has made (or will make) such payment
in
full to Agent on such date in immediately available funds and Agent may (but
shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to
each
Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such
Lender.  If and to the extent Borrower does not make such payment in
full to Agent on the date when due, each Lender severally shall repay to
Agent
on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest
thereon
at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.



(b)  Apportionment
and Application.



(i)  So
long
as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise
provided with respect to Defaulting Lenders, all principal and interest payments
shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders (according to the unpaid
principal balance of the Obligations to which such payments relate held by
each
Lender) and all payments of fees and expenses (other than fees or expenses
that
are for Agent’s separate account) shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders
having a Pro Rata Share of the type of Commitment or Obligation to which
a
particular fee or expense relates.  All payments to be made hereunder
by Borrower shall be remitted to Agent and all (subject to Section 2.4(b)(iv)
hereof) such payments, and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent,
shall
be applied, so long as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing,
to
reduce the balance of the Advances outstanding and, thereafter, to Borrower
(to
be wired to the Designated Account) or such other Person entitled thereto
under
applicable law.





BN
1225807v9




7


















(ii)  At
any
time that an Application Event has occurred and is continuing and except
as
otherwise provided with respect to Defaulting Lenders, all payments remitted
to
Agent and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent shall be applied as
follows:



(A)  first,
to pay any Lender Group Expenses (including cost or expense reimbursements)
or
indemnities then due to Agent under the Loan Documents, until paid in
full,



(B)  second,
to pay any fees or premiums then due to Agent under the Loan Documents until
paid in full,



(C)  third,
to pay interest due in respect of all Protective Advances until paid in
full,



(D)  fourth,
to pay the principal of all Protective Advances until paid in full,



(E)  fifth,
ratably to pay any Lender Group Expenses (including cost or expense
reimbursements) or indemnities then due to any of the Lenders under the Loan
Documents, until paid in full,



(F)  sixth,
ratably to pay any fees or premiums then due to any of the Lenders under
the
Loan Documents until paid in full,



(G)  seventh,
ratably to pay interest due in respect of the Advances (other than Protective
Advances), the Swing Loans, and the Term Loan until paid in full,



(H)  eighth,
ratably (i) to pay the principal of all Swing Loans until paid in full, (ii)
to
pay the principal of all Advances until paid in full, (iii) to Agent, to
be held
by Agent, for the ratable benefit of Issuing Lender and those Lenders having
a
Revolver Commitment, as cash collateral in an amount up to 105% of the Letter
of
Credit Usage, (iv) to Agent, to be held by Agent, for the benefit of the
Bank
Product Providers, as cash collateral in an amount up to the amount of the
Bank
Product Reserve established prior to the occurrence of, and not in contemplation
of, the subject Application Event, and (v) to pay the outstanding principal
balance of the Term Loan (in the inverse order of the maturity of the
installments due thereunder) until the Term Loan is paid in full,



(I)  ninth,
to pay any other Obligations (including the provision of amounts to Agent,
to be
held by Agent, for the benefit of the Bank Product Providers, as cash collateral
in an amount up to the amount determined by Agent in its Permitted Discretion
as
the amount necessary to secure Borrower’s and its Subsidiaries’ obligations in
respect of Bank Products), and



(J)  tenth,
to Borrower (to be wired to the Designated Account) or such other Person
entitled thereto under applicable law.



(iii)  Agent
promptly shall distribute to each Lender, pursuant to the applicable wire
instructions received from each Lender in writing, such funds as it may be
entitled to receive, subject to a Settlement delay as provided in Section
2.3(e).



(iv)  In
each
instance, so long as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing,
Section 2.4(b)(i) shall not apply to any payment made by Borrower to
Agent and specified by Borrower to be for the payment of specific Obligations
then due and payable (or prepayable) under any provision of this
Agreement.







BN
1225807v9




8
















(v)  For
purposes of Section 2.4(b)(ii), “paid in full” means payment of all
amounts owing under the Loan Documents according to the terms thereof, including
loan fees, service fees, professional fees, interest (and specifically including
interest accrued after the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding), default
interest, interest on interest, and expense reimbursements, whether or not
any
of the foregoing would be or is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part
in any
Insolvency Proceeding.



(vi)  In
the
event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section
2.4 and any other provision contained in any other Loan Document, it is
the
intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and
construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each
other.  In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that
cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section
2.4 shall control and govern.



(c)  Mandatory
Prepayments.



(i)  If,
as of
the last day of any month, (A) the outstanding principal balance of the Term
Loan on such date exceeds (B) (I) the product of (x) 0.70 times (y) TTM
Recurring Revenues calculated as of the last month for which financial
statements have most recently been delivered pursuant to Section 5.3,
less  (II) the outstanding balance of Maintenance Advances on such
date (such difference being referred to as the “Loan Limit” and such excess
being referred to as the “Limiter Excess”), then Borrower shall immediately
prepay the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.4(d)(ii) in an
aggregate amount equal to the Limiter Excess.



(ii)  Immediately
upon the receipt by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of the proceeds of
any
voluntary or involuntary sale or disposition by Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries of property or assets (including casualty losses or condemnations
and sales or dispositions which qualify as Permitted Dispositions under clause
(e) of the definition of Permitted Dispositions, but excluding sales or
dispositions which qualify as Permitted Dispositions under clauses (a), (b),
(c), (d), or (f) of the definition of Permitted Dispositions), Borrower shall
prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations in accordance
with
Section 2.4(d)(ii) in an amount equal to (1) 50% of the Net Cash
Proceeds received by Borrower in connection with any sale or disposition
contemplated under clause (e) of the definition of Permitted Dispositions,
and
(2) 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds (including condemnation awards and payments
in
lieu thereof) received by such Person in connection with any other such sales
or
dispositions, but in either case only to the extent that the aggregate amount
of
Net Cash Proceeds received (and not paid to Agent as a prepayment of the
Obligations) by Borrower or its Subsidiaries for all such sales or dispositions
shall exceed $50,000 in any fiscal year; provided that, so long as (A) no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, (B) Borrower
shall have given Agent prior written notice of Borrower’s intention to apply
such monies to the costs of replacement of the properties or assets that
are the
subject of such sale or disposition or the cost of purchase or construction
of
other assets useful in the business of Borrower or its Subsidiaries, (C)
the
monies are held in a cash collateral account in which Agent has a perfected
first-priority security interest, and (D) Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, complete such replacement, purchase, or construction within 180
days
after the initial receipt of such monies, Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall
have the option to apply such monies to the costs of replacement of the property
or assets that are the subject of such sale or disposition or the costs of
purchase or construction of other assets useful in the business of Borrower
and
its Subsidiaries unless and to the extent that such applicable period shall
have
expired without such replacement, purchase or construction being made or
completed, in which case, any amounts remaining in the cash collateral account
shall be paid to Agent and applied in accordance with Section
2.4(d)(ii).  Nothing contained in this Section
2.4(c)(ii) shall permit Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to sell or
otherwise dispose of any property or assets other than in accordance with
Section 6.4.



(iii)  Immediately
upon the receipt by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any Extraordinary
Receipts, Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the
Obligations in







BN
1225807v9




9
















accordance
with Section 2.4(d)(ii) in an amount equal to 100% of such Extraordinary
Receipts, net of any reasonable expenses incurred in collecting such
Extraordinary Receipts.



(iv)  Immediately
upon the issuance or incurrence by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of
any
Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness permitted under
Section 6.1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e),
or (f) ) or the issuance by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any
shares of its or their Stock (other than in the event that Borrower or any
Subsidiary of Borrower forms any Subsidiary in accordance with the terms
hereof,
the issuance by such Subsidiary of Stock to Borrower or such Subsidiary,
as
applicable), Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the
Obligations in accordance with Section 2.4(d)(ii) in an amount equal to
100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by such Person in connection with
such
issuance or incurrence of Indebtedness and the Applicable Percentage of the
Net
Cash Proceeds received by such Person in connection with such issuance of
Stock.  For purposes of this clause (iv) “Applicable Percentage”
means: (A) 25% of the first $1,000,000 of Net Cash Proceeds from Stock issued
since the Closing Date, (B) 50% of the next $4,000,000 of Net Cash Proceeds
from
Stock issued since the Closing Date, and (C) 75% of any other Net Cash Proceeds
from Stock issued since the Closing Date.  The provisions of this
Section 2.4(c)(iv) shall not be deemed to be implied consent to any such
issuance or incurrence otherwise prohibited by the terms and conditions of
this
Agreement.



(v)  Within
10
days of delivery to Agent and the Lenders of audited annual financial statements
pursuant to Section 5.3, commencing with the delivery to Agent and the
Lenders of the financial statements for Borrower’s fiscal year ended December
31, 2007 or, if such financial statements are not delivered to Agent and
the
Lenders on the date such statements are required to be delivered pursuant
to
Section 5.3, 10 days after the date such statements are required to
be delivered to Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.3,
Borrower shall prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations
in
accordance with Section 2.4(d) in an amount equal to 50% of the
Excess Cash Flow of Borrower and its Subsidiaries for such fiscal
year.



(d)  Application
of Payments.



(i)  [intentionally
deleted]



(ii)  Each
prepayment pursuant to Section 2.4(c) above shall (A) so long as no
Application Event shall have occurred and be continuing, be applied,
first, to the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan until paid
in full, second, to the outstanding principal amount of the Advances
(with a corresponding permanent reduction in the Maximum Revolver Amount
in the
case of any prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(ii)), until paid
in full, and third, to cash collateralize the Letters of Credit in an
amount equal to 105% of the then extant Letter of Credit Usage (with a
corresponding permanent reduction in the Maximum Revolver Amount in the case
of
any prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(ii)), and (B) if an
Application Event shall have occurred and be continuing, be applied in the
manner set forth in Section 2.4(b)(ii).  Each prepayment
of the Term Loan pursuant to Sections 2.4(c)(i), 2.4(c)(ii),
2.4(c)(iii), and 2.4(c)(iv) shall be applied against the remaining
installments of principal of the Term Loan in the inverse order of
maturity.  Each prepayment of the Term Loan pursuant to Section
2.4(c)(v) shall be applied against the remaining installments of principal
of the Term Loan on a pro rata basis.



2.5  Overadvances.  If,
at any time or for any reason, the amount of Obligations owed by Borrower
to the
Lender Group pursuant to Section 2.1 or Section 2.12 is greater
than any of the limitations set forth in Section 2.1 or Section
2.12, as applicable (an “Overadvance”), Borrower immediately shall
pay to Agent, in cash, the amount of such excess, which amount shall be used
by
Agent to reduce the Obligations in accordance with the priorities set forth
in
Section 2.4(b).  Borrower promises to pay the Obligations
(including principal, interest, fees, costs, and expenses) in Dollars in
full on
the Maturity Date or, if earlier, on the date on which the Obligations are
declared due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.







BN
1225807v9

2.6  Interest
Rates and Letter of Credit Fee:  Rates, Payments, and
Calculations.



(a)  Interest
Rates.  Except as provided in Section 2.6(c), all
Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit and except for Bank Product
Obligations) that have been charged to the Loan Account pursuant to the terms
hereof shall bear interest on the Daily Balance thereof at a per annum rate
equal to the Base Rate plus the Base Rate Margin.



To
the
extent that interest accrued hereunder at the rate otherwise applicable
hereunder would be less than the foregoing minimum daily rate, the interest
rate
chargeable hereunder for such day automatically shall be deemed increased
to the
minimum rate.



(b)  Letter
of Credit Fee.  Borrower shall pay Agent (for the ratable
benefit of the Lenders with a Revolver Commitment, subject to any agreements
between Agent and individual Lenders), a Letter of Credit fee (in addition
to
the charges, commissions, fees, and costs set forth in Section 2.12(e))
which shall accrue at a rate equal to 4.00% per annum times the Daily
Balance of the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit.



(c)  Default
Rate.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default (and at the election of Agent or the Required
Lenders),

(i)  all
Obligations (except for undrawn Letters of Credit and except for Bank Product
Obligations) that have been charged to the Loan Account pursuant to the terms
hereof shall bear interest on the Daily Balance thereof at a per annum rate
equal to 2 percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise applicable
hereunder, and



(ii)  the
Letter of Credit fee provided for in Section 2.6(b) shall be increased to
2 percentage points above the per annum rate otherwise applicable
hereunder.



(d)  Payment.  Except
as provided to the contrary in Section 2.11, interest, Letter of Credit
fees, and all other fees payable hereunder shall be due and payable, in arrears,
on the first day of each month at any time that Obligations or Commitments
are
outstanding.  Borrower hereby authorizes Agent, from time to time
without prior notice to Borrower, to charge all interest and fees (when due
and
payable), all Lender Group Expenses (as and when incurred), all charges,
commissions, fees, and costs provided for in Section 2.12(e) (as and when
accrued or incurred), all fees and costs provided for in
Section 2.11 (as and when accrued or incurred), and all other
payments as and when due and payable under any Loan Document (including the
amounts due and payable with respect to the Term Loan and including any amounts
due and payable to the Bank Product Providers in respect of Bank Products
up to
the amount of the Bank Product Reserve) to the Loan Account, which amounts
thereafter shall constitute Advances hereunder and shall accrue interest
at the
rate then applicable to Advances that are Base Rate Loans.  Any
interest not paid when due shall be compounded by being charged to the Loan
Account and shall thereafter constitute Advances hereunder and shall accrue
interest at the rate then applicable to Advances that are Base Rate
Loans.



(e)  Computation.  All
interest and fees chargeable under the Loan Documents shall be computed on
the
basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed.  In the
event the Base Rate is changed from time to time hereafter, the rates of
interest hereunder based upon the Base Rate automatically and immediately
shall
be increased or decreased by an amount equal to such change in the Base
Rate.



(f)  Intent
to Limit Charges to Maximum Lawful Rate.  In no event shall
the interest rate or rates payable under this Agreement, plus any other amounts
paid in connection herewith, exceed the highest rate permissible under any
law
that a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem
applicable.  Borrower and the Lender Group, in executing and
delivering this Agreement, intend legally to agree upon the rate or rates
of
interest and manner of payment stated within it; provided,
however, that,







BN
1225807v9




11
















anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or rates of
interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum allowable under applicable
law, then, ipso facto, as of the date of this Agreement, Borrower is
and shall be liable only for the payment of such maximum as allowed by law,
and
payment received from Borrower in excess of such legal maximum, whenever
received, shall be applied to reduce the principal balance of the Obligations
to
the extent of such excess.



2.7  Cash
Management.



(a)  Borrower
shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to (i) establish and maintain
cash management services of a type and on terms satisfactory to Agent at
one or
more of the banks set forth on Schedule 2.7(a) (each a “Cash
Management Bank”), and shall request in writing and otherwise take such
reasonable steps to ensure that all of its and its Subsidiaries’ Account Debtors
forward payment of the amounts owed by them directly to such Cash Management
Bank, and (ii) deposit or cause to be deposited promptly, and in any event
no
later than the first Business Day after the date of receipt thereof, all
of
their Collections (including those sent directly by their Account Debtors
to
Borrower or one of its Subsidiaries) into a bank account in Agent’s name (a
“Cash Management Account”) at one of the Cash Management
Banks.  Except as provided in Schedule 5.19, Borrower shall
establish the Cash Management Accounts in accordance with the foregoing terms
of
this Section 2.7 (a) on or before the Closing Date.



(b)  Each
Cash
Management Bank shall establish and maintain Cash Management Agreements with
Agent and Borrower.  Each such Cash Management Agreement shall
provide, among other things, that (i) the Cash Management Bank will comply
with
any instructions originated by Agent directing the disposition of the funds
in
such Cash Management Account without further consent by Borrower or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, (ii) the Cash Management Bank has no rights
of
setoff or recoupment or any other claim against the applicable Cash Management
Account other than for payment of its service fees and other charges directly
related to the administration of such Cash Management Account and for returned
checks or other items of payment, and (iii) the Cash Management Bank will
forward, by daily sweep, all amounts in the applicable Cash Management Account
to the Agent’s Account.



(c)  So
long
as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower
may
amend Schedule 2.7(a) to add or replace a Cash Management Bank or Cash
Management Account; provided, however, that (i) such prospective
Cash Management Bank shall be reasonably satisfactory to Agent, and (ii)
prior
to the time of the opening of such Cash Management Account, Borrower (or
its
Subsidiary, as applicable) and such prospective Cash Management Bank shall
have
executed and delivered to Agent a Cash Management Agreement.  Borrower
(or its Subsidiaries, as applicable) shall close any of its Cash Management
Accounts (and establish replacement cash management accounts in accordance
with
the foregoing sentence) promptly and in any event within 30 days of notice
from
Agent that the creditworthiness of any Cash Management Bank is no longer
acceptable in Agent’s reasonable judgment, or as promptly as practicable and in
any event within 60 days of notice from Agent that the operating performance,
funds transfer, or availability procedures or performance of the Cash Management
Bank with respect to Cash Management Accounts or Agent’s liability under any
Cash Management Agreement with such Cash Management Bank is no longer acceptable
in Agent’s reasonable judgment.



(d)  Each
Cash
Management Account shall be a cash collateral account subject to a Control
Agreement.



2.8  Crediting
Payments; Clearance Charge.  The receipt
of any payment item by Agent (whether from transfers to Agent by the Cash
Management Banks pursuant to the Cash Management Agreements or otherwise)
shall
not be considered a payment on account unless such payment item is a wire
transfer of immediately available federal funds made to the Agent’s Account or
unless and until such payment item is honored when presented for
payment.  Should any payment item not be honored when presented for
payment, then Borrower shall be deemed not to have made such payment and
interest shall be calculated







BN
1225807v9

accordingly.  Anything
to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, any payment item shall
be
deemed received by Agent only if it is received into the Agent’s Account on a
Business Day on or before 11:00 a.m. (California time).  If any
payment item is received into the Agent’s Account on a non-Business Day or after
11:00 a.m. (California time) on a Business Day, it shall be deemed to have
been
received by Agent as of the opening of business on the immediately following
Business Day.  From and after the Closing Date, Agent shall be
entitled to charge Borrower for one Business Day of ‘clearance’ at the rate then
applicable under Section 2.6 to Advances that are Base Rate Loans on all
Collections that are received by Borrower and its Subsidiaries (regardless
of
whether forwarded by the Cash Management Banks to Agent).  This
across-the-board one Business Day clearance charge on all Collections of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries is acknowledged by the parties to constitute
an
integral aspect of the pricing of the financing of Borrower and shall apply
irrespective of whether or not there are any outstanding monetary Obligations;
the effect of such clearance charge being the equivalent of charging interest
on
such Collections through the completion of a period ending one Business Day
after the receipt thereof.  The parties acknowledge and agree that the
economic benefit of the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8 shall be
for the exclusive benefit of Agent.



2.9  Designated
Account.  Agent is authorized to make
the Advances and the Term Loan, and Issuing Lender is authorized to issue
the
Letters of Credit, under this Agreement based upon telephonic or other
instructions received from anyone purporting to be an Authorized Person or,
without instructions, if pursuant to Section 2.6(d).  Borrower
agrees to establish and maintain the Designated Account with the Designated
Account Bank for the purpose of receiving the proceeds of the Advances requested
by Borrower and made by Agent or the Lenders hereunder.  Unless
otherwise agreed by Agent and Borrower, any Advance, Protective Advance,
or
Swing Loan requested by Borrower and made by Agent or the Lenders hereunder
shall be made to the Designated Account.



2.10  Maintenance
of Loan Account; Statements of
Obligations.  Agent shall maintain an
account on its books in the name of Borrower (the “Loan Account”) on
which Borrower will be charged with the Term Loan, all Advances (including
Protective Advances and Swing Loans) made by Agent, Swing Lender, or the
Lenders
to Borrower or for Borrower’s account, the Letters of Credit issued by Issuing
Lender for Borrower’s account, and with all other payment Obligations hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents (except for Bank Product Obligations),
including, accrued interest, fees and expenses, and Lender Group
Expenses.  In accordance with Section 2.8, the Loan Account
will be credited with all payments received by Agent from Borrower or for
Borrower’s account, including all amounts received in the Agent’s Account from
any Cash Management Bank.  Agent shall render statements regarding the
Loan Account to Borrower, including principal, interest, fees, and including
an
itemization of all charges and expenses constituting Lender Group Expenses
owing, and such statements, absent manifest error, shall be conclusively
presumed to be correct and accurate and constitute an account stated between
Borrower and the Lender Group unless, within 30 days after receipt thereof
by
Borrower, Borrower shall deliver to Agent written objection thereto describing
the error or errors contained in any such statements.



2.11  Fees.  Borrower
shall pay to Agent, as and when due and payable under the terms of the Fee
Letter, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter.



2.12  Letters
of Credit.



(a)  Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Issuing Lender agrees
to
issue letters of credit for the account of Borrower (each, an “L/C”) or
to purchase participations or execute indemnities or reimbursement obligations
(each such undertaking, an “L/C Undertaking”) with respect to letters of
credit issued by an Underlying Issuer (as of the Closing Date, the prospective
Underlying Issuer is to be Wells Fargo) for the account of
Borrower.  Each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or the
amendment, renewal, or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit, shall
be
made in writing by an Authorized Person and delivered to the Issuing Lender
and
Agent via hand delivery, telefacsimile, or other electronic method of
transmission reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment,






BN
1225807v9




13


















renewal,
or extension.  Each such request shall be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Issuing Lender in its Permitted Discretion and shall
specify
(i) the amount of such Letter of Credit, (ii) the date of issuance, amendment,
renewal, or extension of such Letter of Credit, (iii) the expiration date
of
such Letter of Credit, (iv) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof
(or
the beneficiary of the Underlying Letter of Credit, as applicable), and (v)
such
other information (including, in the case of an amendment, renewal, or
extension, identification of the outstanding Letter of Credit to be so amended,
renewed, or extended) as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew, or
extend
such Letter of Credit.  If requested by the Issuing Lender, Borrower
also shall be an applicant under the application with respect to any Underlying
Letter of Credit that is to be the subject of an L/C Undertaking.  The
Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if any
of
the following would result after giving effect to the issuance of such requested
Letter of Credit:



(i)  the
Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing Base less the
outstanding amount of Advances, or



(ii)  the
Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $2,000,000, or



(iii)  the
Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount less
the outstanding amount of Advances less the Bank Product Reserve,
and less the aggregate amount of reserves, if any, established by Agent
under Section 2.1(b).



Borrower
and the Lender Group acknowledge and agree that certain Underlying Letters
of
Credit may be issued to support letters of credit that already are outstanding
as of the Closing Date.  Each Letter of Credit (and corresponding
Underlying Letter of Credit) shall be in form and substance acceptable to
the
Issuing Lender (in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion), including the
requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in
Dollars.  If Issuing Lender is obligated to advance funds under a
Letter of Credit, Borrower immediately shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement
to
Issuing Lender by paying to Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement
not
later than 11:00 a.m., California time, on the date that such L/C Disbursement
is made, if Borrower shall have received written or telephonic notice of
such
L/C Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., California time, on such date, or,
if such
notice has not been received by Borrower prior to such time on such date,
then
not later than 11:00 a.m., California time, on the Business Day that Borrower
receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., California
time, on the date of receipt, and, in the absence of such reimbursement,
the L/C
Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be an Advance
hereunder and, initially, shall bear interest at the rate then applicable
to
Advances that are Base Rate Loans.  To the extent an L/C Disbursement
is deemed to be an Advance hereunder, Borrower’s obligation to reimburse such
L/C Disbursement shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting
Advance.  Promptly following receipt by Agent of any payment from
Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, Agent shall distribute such payment
to the
Issuing Lender or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant
to
Section 2.12(b) to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and
the Issuing Lender as their interests may appear.



(b)  Promptly
following receipt of a notice of L/C Disbursement pursuant to
Section 2.12(a), each Lender with a Revolver Commitment agrees to
fund its Pro Rata Share of any Advance deemed made pursuant to the foregoing
subsection on the same terms and conditions as if Borrower had requested
such
Advance and Agent shall promptly pay to Issuing Lender the amounts so received
by it from the Lenders.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without
any
further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or the Lenders with Revolver
Commitments, the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have granted to each Lender
with a Revolver Commitment, and each Lender with a Revolver Commitment shall
be
deemed to have purchased, a participation in each Letter of Credit, in an
amount
equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Risk Participation Liability of such Letter
of Credit, and each such Lender agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of
the
Issuing Lender, such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any payments made by the Issuing
Lender under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in
furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender with a Revolver Commitment hereby








BN
1225807v9




14
















absolutely
and unconditionally agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of the Issuing
Lender, such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of each L/C Disbursement made by the
Issuing Lender and not reimbursed by Borrower on the date due as provided
in
Section 2.12(a), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded
to Borrower for any reason.  Each Lender with a Revolver Commitment
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to deliver to Agent, for the
account
of the Issuing Lender, an amount equal to its respective Pro Rata Share of
each
L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section
2.12(b) shall be absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be
made notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default
or
Default or the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section
3.  If any such Lender fails to make available to Agent the amount
of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of each L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing
Lender in respect of such Letter of Credit as provided in this Section, such
Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender and Agent (for the account
of
the Issuing Lender) shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from
such
Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate until
paid
in full.



(c)  Borrower
hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend, and hold the Lender Group harmless
from any loss, cost, expense, or liability, and reasonable attorneys fees
incurred by the Lender Group arising out of or in connection with any Letter
of
Credit; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be obligated
hereunder to indemnify for any loss, cost, expense, or liability to the extent
that it is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing
Lender or any other member of the Lender Group.  Borrower agrees to be
bound by the Underlying Issuer’s regulations and interpretations of any
Underlying Letter of Credit or by Issuing Lender’s interpretations of any L/C
issued by Issuing Lender to or for Borrower’s account, even though this
interpretation may be different from Borrower’s own, and Borrower understands
and agrees that the Lender Group shall not be liable for any error, negligence,
or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrower’s
instructions or those contained in the Letter of Credit or any modifications,
amendments, or supplements thereto.  Borrower understands that the L/C
Undertakings may require Issuing Lender to indemnify the Underlying Issuer
for
certain costs or liabilities arising out of claims by Borrower against such
Underlying Issuer.  Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, save, defend,
and hold the Lender Group harmless with respect to any loss, cost, expense
(including reasonable attorneys fees), or liability incurred by the Lender
Group
under any L/C Undertaking as a result of the Lender Group’s indemnification of
any Underlying Issuer; provided, however, that Borrower shall not
be obligated hereunder to indemnify for any loss, cost, expense, or liability
to
the extent that it is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of
the Issuing Lender or any other member of the Lender Group.  Borrower
hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither the Lender Group nor the Issuing
Lender shall be responsible for delays, errors, or omissions resulting from
the
malfunction of equipment in connection with any Letter of Credit.



(d)  Borrower
hereby authorizes and directs any Underlying Issuer to deliver to the Issuing
Lender all instruments, documents, and other writings and property received
by
such Underlying Issuer pursuant to such Underlying Letter of Credit and to
accept and rely upon the Issuing Lender’s instructions with respect to all
matters arising in connection with such Underlying Letter of Credit and the
related application.



(e)  Any
and
all issuance charges, commissions, fees, and costs incurred by the Issuing
Lender relating to Underlying Letters of Credit shall be Lender Group Expenses
for purposes of this Agreement and immediately shall be reimbursable by Borrower
to Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender; it being acknowledged and
agreed
by Borrower that, as of the Closing Date, the issuance charge imposed by
the
prospective Underlying Issuer is .825% per annum times the undrawn amount
of
each Underlying Letter of Credit, that such issuance charge may be changed
from
time to time, and that the Underlying Issuer also imposes a schedule of charges
for amendments, extensions, drawings, and renewals.



(f)  If
by
reason of (i) any change after the Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty,
rule, or regulation or any change in the interpretation or application thereof
by any Governmental Authority, or (ii) compliance by the Underlying Issuer
or
the Lender Group with any direction, request, or requirement (irrespective
of
whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority or monetary
authority





BN
1225807v9




15


















including,
Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board as from time to time in effect
(and
any successor thereto):



(i)  any
reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or shall be imposed or modified
in
respect of any Letter of Credit issued hereunder, or



(ii)  there
shall be imposed on the Underlying Issuer or the Lender Group any other
condition regarding any Underlying Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit
issued pursuant hereto, and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly
or indirectly, the cost to the Lender Group of issuing, making, guaranteeing,
or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect
thereof by the Lender Group, then, and in any such case, Agent may, at any
time
within a reasonable period after the additional cost is incurred or the amount
received is reduced, notify Borrower, and Borrower shall pay on demand such
amounts as Agent may specify to be necessary to compensate the Lender Group
for
such additional cost or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount
from the date of such demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then
applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder.  The determination by Agent
of any amount due pursuant to this Section, as set forth in a certificate
setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the
absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding
on all of the parties hereto.



2.13  [INTENTIONALLY
DELETED].



2.14  Capital
Requirements.  If, after the date
hereof, any Lender determines that (i) the adoption of or change in any law,
rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital requirements for banks or
bank
holding companies, or any change in the interpretation or application thereof
by
any Governmental Authority charged with the administration thereof, or (ii)
compliance by such Lender or its parent bank holding company with any guideline,
request, or directive of any such entity regarding capital adequacy (whether
or
not having the force of law), has the effect of reducing the return on such
Lender’s or such holding company’s capital as a consequence of such Lender’s
Commitments hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such holding
company could have achieved but for such adoption, change, or compliance
(taking
into consideration such Lender’s or such holding company’s then existing
policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming the full utilization
of
such entity’s capital) by any amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then
such Lender may notify Borrower and Agent thereof.  Following receipt
of such notice, Borrower agrees to pay such Lender on demand the amount of
such
reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is determined,
payable
within 90 days after presentation by such Lender of a statement in the amount
and setting forth in reasonable detail such Lender’s calculation thereof and the
assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which statement shall
be
deemed true and correct absent manifest error).  In determining such
amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
methods.



3.  CONDITIONS;
TERM OF AGREEMENT.



3.1  Conditions
Precedent to the Initial Extension of
Credit.  The obligation of each Lender
to make its initial extension of credit provided for hereunder, is subject
to
the fulfillment, to the satisfaction of Agent and each Lender of each of
the
conditions precedent set forth on Schedule 3.1 (the making of such
initial extension of credit by a Lender being conclusively deemed to be its
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent).



3.2  Conditions
Precedent to all Extensions of
Credit.  The obligation of the Lender
Group (or any member thereof) to make any Advances hereunder (or to extend
any
other credit hereunder) at any time shall be subject to the following conditions

materiality
qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that
already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) on
and as
of the date of such extension of credit, as though made on and as of such
date
(except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely
to
an earlier date);



(b)  no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the
date of
such extension of credit, nor shall either result from the making
thereof;



(c)  no
injunction, writ, restraining order, or other order of any nature restricting
or
prohibiting, directly or indirectly, the extending of such credit shall have
been issued and remain in force by any Governmental Authority against Borrower,

existing Letter of Credit Usage, and (b) providing Bank Product
Collateralization with respect to the then existing Bank Products), in full,
on
the date set forth as the date of termination of this Agreement in such

5.5  Inspection.  Permit
Agent, each Lender, and each of their duly authorized representatives or
agents
to visit any of its properties and inspect any of its assets or books and
records, to examine and make copies of its books and records, and to discuss

of
all material leases to which it is a party as lessee, so as to prevent any
loss

interruption, public liability, and product liability insurance, as well
as
insurance against larceny, embezzlement, and criminal
misappropriation.  All such policies of insurance shall be in such
amounts and with such insurance companies as are reasonably satisfactory
to
Agent. Borrower shall deliver copies of all such policies to Agent with an

to give not less than 30 days prior written notice to Agent in the event
of
cancellation of the policy for any reason whatsoever.



(b)  Borrower
shall give Agent prompt notice of any loss exceeding $100,000 covered by
such
insurance.  So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Borrower shall have the exclusive right to adjust any losses
payable
under any such insurance policies which are less than
$100,000.  Following the occurrence and during the continuation of an
Event of Default, or in the case of any losses payable under such insurance

whatsoever in respect of such adjustments.

with Laws.  Comply with the requirements
of all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and orders of any Governmental

to result in a Material Adverse Change.



5.11  Leases.  Pay
when due all rents and other amounts payable under any material leases to
which
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Borrower’s or any
such Subsidiaries’ properties and assets are bound, unless such payments are the
subject of a Permitted Protest.



5.12  Existence.  At
all times preserve and keep in full force and effect Borrower’s and its
Subsidiaries, valid existence and good standing and, except as could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change, any rights,

than 5 Business Days after obtaining knowledge thereof, notify Agent if any
written information, exhibit, or report furnished to the Lender Group contained,
at the time it was furnished, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted

of
the Schedules hereto or to the Disclosure Statement.

8.  THE
LENDER GROUP’S RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.



8.1  Rights
and Remedies.  Upon the occurrence, and
during the continuation, of an Event of Default, the Required Lenders (at
their
election but without notice of their election and without demand) may authorize
and instruct Agent to do any one or more of the following on behalf of the
Lender Group (and Agent, acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders,
shall do the same on behalf of the Lender Group), all of which are authorized
by
Borrower:



(a)  Declare
all or any portion of the Obligations, whether evidenced by this Agreement,
by
any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise, immediately due and
payable;



(b)  Cease
advancing money or extending credit to or for the benefit of Borrower under
this
Agreement, under any of the Loan Documents, or under any other agreement
between
Borrower and the Lender Group;



(c)  Terminate
this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents as to any future liability
or
obligation of the Lender Group, but without affecting any of the Agent’s Liens
in the Collateral and without affecting the Obligations; and



(d)  The
Lender Group shall have all other rights and remedies available at law or
in
equity or pursuant to any other Loan Document.



The
foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the occurrence of any Event
of
Default described in Section 7.4 or Section 7.5, in addition to
the remedies set forth above, without any notice to Borrower or any other
Person
or any act by the Lender Group, the Commitments shall automatically terminate
and the Obligations then outstanding, together with all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and all fees and all other amounts due under this Agreement
and
the other Loan Documents, shall automatically and immediately become due
and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest, or notice of any kind, all
of
which are expressly waived by Borrower.



8.2  Remedies
Cumulative.  The rights and remedies of
the Lender Group under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and all
other
agreements shall be cumulative.  The Lender Group shall have all other
rights and remedies not inconsistent herewith as provided under the Code,
by
law, or in equity.  No exercise by the Lender Group of one right or
remedy shall be deemed an election, and no waiver by the Lender Group of
any
Event of Default shall be deemed a continuing waiver.  No delay by the
Lender Group shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by
it.



9.  TAXES
AND EXPENSES.



If
Borrower
or its Subsidiaries fail to pay any monies (whether taxes, assessments,
insurance premiums, or, in the case of leased properties or assets, rents
or
other amounts payable under such leases) due to third Persons, or fails to
make
any deposits or furnish any required proof of payment or deposit, all as
required under the terms of this Agreement, then, Agent, in its sole discretion
and without prior notice to Borrower, may do any or all of the
following:  (a) make payment of the same or any part thereof, (b) set
up such reserves against the Borrowing Base or the Maximum Revolver Amount
as
Agent deems necessary to protect the Lender Group from the exposure created
by
such failure, or (c) in the case of the failure to comply with Section
5.8 hereof, obtain and maintain insurance policies of the type described
in
Section 5.8 and take any action with respect to such policies as Agent
deems prudent.  Any such amounts paid by Agent shall constitute Lender
Group Expenses and any such payments shall not constitute an agreement by
the
Lender





BN
1225807v9




31


















Group
to
make similar payments in the future or a waiver by the Lender Group of any
Event
of Default under this Agreement.  Agent need not inquire as to, or
contest the validity of, any such expense, tax, or Lien and the receipt of
the
usual official notice for the payment thereof shall be conclusive evidence
that
the same was validly due and owing.



10.  WAIVERS;
INDEMNIFICATION.



10.1  Demand;
Protest; etc.  Borrower waives demand,
protest, notice of protest, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment
and
nonpayment, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension,
or renewal of documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees at any
time
held by the Lender Group on which Borrower may in any way be
liable.



10.2  The
Lender Group’s Liability for
Collateral.  Borrower hereby agrees
that:  (a) so long as Agent complies with its obligations, if
any, under the Code, the Lender Group shall not in any way or manner be liable
or responsible for:  (i) the safekeeping of the Collateral, (ii) any
loss or damage thereto occurring or arising in any manner or fashion from
any
cause, (iii) any diminution in the value thereof, or (iv) any act or default of
any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, forwarding agency, or other Person, and
(b)
all risk of loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne
by
Borrower.



10.3  Indemnification.  Borrower
shall pay, indemnify, defend, and hold the Agent-Related Persons, the
Lender-Related Persons, and each Participant (each, an “Indemnified
Person”) harmless (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against
any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings,
liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and damages, and all reasonable fees
and
disbursements of attorneys, experts, or consultants and all other costs and
expenses actually incurred in connection therewith or in connection with
the
enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and
irrespective of whether suit is brought), at any time asserted against, imposed
upon, or incurred by any of them (a) in connection with or as a result of
or
related to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance, or administration
(including any restructuring or workout with respect hereto) of this Agreement,
any of the other Loan Documents, or the transactions contemplated hereby
or
thereby or the monitoring of Borrower’s and its Subsidiaries’ compliance with
the terms of the Loan Documents, (b) with respect to any investigation,
litigation, or proceeding related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document,
or
the use of the proceeds of the credit provided hereunder (irrespective of
whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto), or any act, omission,
event,
or circumstance in any manner related thereto, and (c) in connection with
or arising out of any presence or release of Hazardous Materials at, on,
under,
to or from any assets or properties owned, leased or operated by Borrower
or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental Actions, Environmental Liabilities
and
Costs or Remedial Actions related in any way to any such assets or properties
of
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (each and all of the foregoing, the
“Indemnified Liabilities”).  The foregoing to the contrary
notwithstanding, Borrower shall have no obligation to any Indemnified Person
under this Section 10.3 with respect to any Indemnified Liability that a
court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from
the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person.  This provision shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations.  If any Indemnified
Person makes any payment to any other Indemnified Person with respect to
an
Indemnified Liability as to which Borrower was required to indemnify the
Indemnified Person receiving such payment, the Indemnified Person making
such
payment is entitled to be indemnified and reimbursed by Borrower with respect
thereto.  WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL
APPLY TO EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES
WHICH
IN WHOLE OR IN PART ARE CAUSED BY OR ARISE OUT OF ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION
OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR OF ANY OTHER PERSON.

Obligations, the Commitments and the other rights and obligations of such
Lender
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, in a minimum amount (unless

an assignment or delegation by any Lender to any other Lender or an Affiliate
of
any Lender or (y) a group of new Lenders, each of whom is an Affiliate of
each
other or a fund or account managed by any such new Lender or an Affiliate
of
such new Lender to the extent that the aggregate amount to be assigned to
all
such new Lenders is at least $5,000,000); provided, however, that
Borrower and Agent may continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender

notice
of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses, and related
information with respect to the Assignee, have been given to Borrower and
Agent
by such Lender and the Assignee, (ii) such Lender and its Assignee have
delivered to Borrower and Agent an Assignment and Acceptance and Agent has

fee in the amount of $3,500.  Anything contained herein to the

not
be
required and the Assignee need not be an Eligible Transferee if such assignment
is in connection with any merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, or other
disposition of all or any substantial portion of the business or loan portfolio
of the assigning Lender.



(b)  From
and
after the date that Agent notifies the assigning Lender (with a copy to
Borrower) that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance and,
if
applicable, payment of the required processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall
have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, and (ii)
the
assigning Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
and
under the other Loan Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (except with respect to
Section 10.3 hereof) and be released from any future obligations under
this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all or
the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto and thereto), and such assignment shall effect a novation among Borrower,
the assigning Lender, and the Assignee; provided, however, that
nothing contained herein shall release any assigning Lender from obligations
that survive the termination of this Agreement, including such assigning
Lender’s obligations under Section 15 and Section 17.9(a) of this
Agreement.



(c)  By
executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender
thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other
and
the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) other than as provided in

or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement
or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency
or
value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto,
(ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes
no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of Borrower or the
performance or observance by Borrower of any of its obligations under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto, (iii) such
Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together
with
such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make
its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance,
(iv) such Assignee will, independently and without reliance upon Agent, such
assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, (v)
such
Assignee appoints and authorizes Agent to take such actions and to exercise
such
powers under this Agreement as are delegated to Agent, by the terms hereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and (vi)
such
Assignee agrees that it will perform all of the obligations which by the
terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.



(d)  Immediately
upon Agent’s receipt of the required processing fee, if applicable, and delivery
of notice to the assigning Lender pursuant to Section 13.1(b), this
Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent,
necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment
of the Commitments arising therefrom.  The Commitment allocated to
each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the assigning Lender pro
tanto.



(e)  Any
Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks, financial
institutions, or other Persons (a “Participant”) participating interests
in all or any portion of its Obligations, its Commitment, and the other rights
and interests of that Lender (the “Originating Lender”) hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that (i) the
Originating Lender shall remain a “Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and the Participant receiving the participating
interest in the Obligations, the Commitments, and the other rights and interests
of the Originating Lender hereunder shall not constitute a “Lender” hereunder or
under the other Loan Documents and the Originating Lender’s obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Originating Lender shall
remain

the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Originating
Lender in connection with the Originating Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) no Lender shall transfer
or
grant any participating interest under which the Participant has the right
to
approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent such amendment
to, or
consent or waiver with respect to this Agreement or of any other Loan Document
would (A) extend the final maturity date of the Obligations hereunder in
which such Participant is participating, (B) reduce the interest rate
applicable to the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant is
participating, (C) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or
guaranties (except to the extent expressly provided herein or in any of the
Loan
Documents) supporting the Obligations hereunder in which such Participant
is
participating, (D) postpone the payment of, or reduce the amount of, the
interest or fees payable to such Participant through such Lender, or (E)
change
the amount or due dates of scheduled principal repayments or prepayments
or
premiums, and (v) all amounts payable by Borrower hereunder shall be determined
as if such Lender had not sold such participation, except that, if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared
or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set off in respect
of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same
extent
as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it
as a
Lender under this Agreement.  The rights of any Participant only shall
be derivative through the Originating Lender with whom such Participant
participates and no Participant shall have any rights under this Agreement
or
the other Loan Documents or any direct rights as to the other Lenders, Agent,
Borrower, the Collections of Borrower or its Subsidiaries, the Collateral,
or
otherwise in respect of the Obligations.  No Participant shall have
the right to participate directly in the making of decisions by the Lenders
among themselves.



(f)  In
connection with any such assignment or participation or proposed assignment
or
participation, a Lender may, subject to the provisions of Section
17.9,  disclose all documents and information which it now or
hereafter may have relating to Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses.



(g)  Any
other
provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, any Lender may at any time create
a
security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and
interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance
with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Bank or U.S. Treasury Regulation
31 CFR
§203.24, and such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce such pledge or security
interest in any manner permitted under applicable law.



13.2  Successors.  This
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors
and
assigns of each of the parties; provided, however, that Borrower
may not assign this Agreement or any rights or duties hereunder without the
Lenders’ prior written consent and any prohibited assignment shall be absolutely
void ab initio.  No consent to assignment by the Lenders
shall release Borrower from its Obligations.  A Lender may assign this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and its rights and duties hereunder
and
thereunder pursuant to Section 13.1 hereof and, except as expressly
required pursuant to Section 13.1 hereof, no consent or approval by
Borrower is required in connection with any such assignment.



14.  AMENDMENTS;
WAIVERS.



14.1  Amendments
and Waivers.  No amendment or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (other than Bank
Product Agreements or the Fee Letter), and no consent with respect to any
departure by Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall
be in
writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by Agent at the written request
of the Required Lenders) and Borrower and then any such waiver or consent
shall
be effective, but only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for
which given; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or
consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lenders directly
affected thereby and Borrower, do any of the following:





BN

(a)  increase

any
payment of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts due hereunder or under
any other Loan Document,

of
credit hereunder, or reduce any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or
under
any other Loan Document,



(d)  change
the Pro Rata Share that is required to take any action hereunder,



(e)  amend
or
modify this Section or any provision of this Agreement providing for consent
or
other action by all Lenders,

the Collateral,



(g)  change
the definition of “Required Lenders” or “Pro Rata Share”,



(h)  contractually
subordinate any of the Agent’s Liens,



(i)  other
than in connection with a merger, liquidation, dissolution or sale of such
Person expressly permitted by the terms hereof or the other Loan Documents,

money,



(j)  amend
any
of the provisions of Section 2.4(b)(i) or (ii),



(k)  change
the definition of Borrowing Base or the definitions of Eligible Accounts,
Eligible Inventory, Maximum Revolver Amount, Term Loan Amount, or change
Section 2.1(b), or



(l)  amend
any
of the provisions of Section 15.



and,
provided further, however, that no amendment, waiver or consent
shall, unless in writing and signed by Agent, Issuing Lender, or Swing Lender,
as applicable, affect the rights or duties of Agent, Issuing Lender, or Swing
Lender, as applicable, under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.  The foregoing notwithstanding, any amendment, modification,
waiver, consent, termination, or release of, or with respect to, any provision
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that relates only to the
relationship of the Lender Group among themselves, and that does not affect
the
rights or obligations of Borrower, shall not require consent by or the agreement
of Borrower.



14.2  Replacement
of Holdout Lender.



(a)  If
any
action to be taken by the Lender Group or Agent hereunder requires the unanimous
consent, authorization, or agreement of all Lenders, and a Lender (“Holdout
Lender”) fails to give its consent, authorization, or agreement, then Agent,
upon at least 5 Business Days prior irrevocable notice to the Holdout Lender,
may permanently replace the Holdout Lender with one or more substitute Lenders
(each, a “Replacement Lender”), and the Holdout Lender shall have no
right to refuse to be replaced hereunder.  Such notice to replace the
Holdout Lender shall specify an effective date for such replacement, which
date
shall not be later than 15 Business Days after the date such notice is
given.



(b)  Prior
to
the effective date of such replacement, the Holdout Lender and each Replacement
Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject only
to
the Holdout Lender being repaid its share of the outstanding Obligations
(including an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of





BN
1225807v9




37


















the
Risk
Participation Liability) without any premium or penalty of any kind
whatsoever.  If the Holdout Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and
deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of
such
replacement, the Holdout Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered
such Assignment and Acceptance.  The replacement of any Holdout Lender
shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section
13.1.  Until such time as the Replacement Lenders shall have
acquired all of the Obligations, the Commitments, and the other rights and
obligations of the Holdout Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
the Holdout Lender shall remain obligated to make the Holdout Lender’s Pro Rata
Share of Advances and to purchase a participation in each Letter of Credit,
in
an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Risk Participation Liability
of
such Letter of Credit.



14.3  No
Waivers; Cumulative Remedies.  No
failure by Agent or any Lender to exercise any right, remedy, or option under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or delay by Agent or any Lender in
exercising the same, will operate as a waiver thereof.  No waiver by
Agent or any Lender will be effective unless it is in writing, and then only
to
the extent specifically stated.  No waiver by Agent or any Lender on
any occasion shall affect or diminish Agent’s and each Lender’s rights
thereafter to require strict performance by Borrower of any provision of
this
Agreement.  Agent’s and each Lender’s rights under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other
right
or remedy that Agent or any Lender may have.



15.  AGENT;
THE LENDER GROUP.



15.1  Appointment
and Authorization of Agent.  Each Lender
hereby designates and appoints WFF as its representative under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes
Agent
to execute and deliver each of the other Loan Documents on its behalf and
to
take such other action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement
and
each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties
as
are expressly delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.  Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions
contained in this Section 15.  The provisions of this
Section 15 are solely for the benefit of Agent and the Lenders, and
Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall have no rights as a third party beneficiary
of any of the provisions contained herein.  Any provision to the
contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document
notwithstanding, Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except
those expressly set forth herein, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have
any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against Agent; it
being
expressly understood and agreed that the use of the word “Agent” is for
convenience only, that WFF is merely the representative of the Lenders, and
only
has the contractual duties set forth herein.  Except as expressly
otherwise provided in this Agreement, Agent shall have and may use its sole
discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any
discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions that
Agent
expressly is entitled to take or assert under or pursuant to this Agreement
and
the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, or of any other provision of the Loan Documents that provides
rights
or powers to Agent, Lenders agree that Agent shall have the right to exercise
the following powers as long as this Agreement remains in effect:  (a)
maintain, in accordance with its customary business practices, ledgers and
records reflecting the status of the Obligations, the Collateral, the
Collections of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and related matters, (b) execute
or file any and all financing or similar statements or notices, amendments,
renewals, supplements, documents, instruments, proofs of claim, notices and
other written agreements with respect to the Loan Documents, (c) make Advances,
for itself or on behalf of Lenders as provided in the Loan Documents, (d)
exclusively receive, apply, and distribute the Collections of Borrower and
its
Subsidiaries as provided in the Loan Documents, (e) open and maintain such
bank
accounts and cash management arrangements as Agent deems necessary and
appropriate in accordance with the Loan Documents for the foregoing purposes
with respect to the Collateral and the Collections of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, (f) perform, exercise, and enforce any and all other rights
and remedies of the Lender Group with respect to Borrower or its Subsidiaries,
the Obligations, the Collateral, the Collections of





BN
1225807v9




38


















Borrower
and its Subsidiaries, or otherwise related to any of same as provided in
the
Loan Documents, and (g) incur and pay such Lender Group Expenses as Agent
may
deem necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its
functions and powers pursuant to the Loan Documents.



15.2  Delegation
of Duties.  Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents,
employees or attorneys in fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney in
fact
that it selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence
or
willful misconduct.



15.3  Liability
of Agent.  None of the Agent-Related
Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
any
of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or
the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence
or
willful misconduct), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders
for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Borrower or
any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any officer or director thereof, contained
in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by
Agent
under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of Borrower or its
Subsidiaries or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance
or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the books and records
or
properties of Borrower or its Subsidiaries.



15.4  Reliance
by Agent.  Agent shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, telefacsimile
or
other electronic method of transmission, telex or telephone message, statement
or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
and
to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrower or
counsel
to any Lender), independent accountants and other experts selected by
Agent.  Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless Agent shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Lenders as it deems appropriate
and until such instructions are received, Agent shall act, or refrain from
acting, as it deems advisable.  If Agent so requests, it shall first
be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders against any
and all
liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.  Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or
any
other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the requisite
Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto
shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.



15.5  Notice
of Default or Event of Default.  Agent
shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any
Default
or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of
principal, interest, fees, and expenses required to be paid to Agent for
the
account of the Lenders and, except with respect to Events of Default of which
Agent has actual knowledge, unless Agent shall have received written notice
from
a Lender or Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default
or
Event of Default, and stating that such notice is a “notice of
default.”  Agent promptly will notify the Lenders of its receipt of
any such notice or of any Event of Default of which Agent has actual
knowledge.  If any Lender obtains actual knowledge of any Event of
Default, such Lender promptly shall notify the other Lenders and Agent of
such
Event of Default.  Each Lender shall be solely responsible for giving
any notices to its Participants, if any.  Subject to Section
15.4, Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event
of
Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Section 8; provided, however, that unless and until Agent
has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take
such







BN
1225807v9




39


















action,
or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event
of
Default as it shall deem advisable.



15.6  Credit
Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that
none of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty
to it,
and that no act by Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of Borrower and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute
any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any
Lender.  Each Lender represents to Agent that it has, independently
and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and
other condition and creditworthiness of Borrower or any other Person party
to a
Loan Document, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into
this
Agreement and to extend credit to Borrower.  Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
and
the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrower or any other Person
party
to a Loan Document.  Except for notices, reports, and other documents
expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by Agent, Agent
shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit
or
other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of Borrower or any other
Person party to a Loan Document that may come into the possession of any
of the
Agent-Related Persons.



15.7  Costs
and Expenses; Indemnification.  Agent
may incur and pay Lender Group Expenses to the extent Agent reasonably deems
necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions,
powers, and obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents, including court costs,
attorneys fees and expenses, fees and expenses of financial accountants,
advisors, consultants, and appraisers, costs of collection by outside collection
agencies, auctioneer fees and expenses, and costs of security guards or
insurance premiums paid to maintain the Collateral, whether or not Borrower
is
obligated to reimburse Agent or Lenders for such expenses pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise.  Agent is authorized and directed to deduct
and retain sufficient amounts from the Collections of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries received by Agent to reimburse Agent for such out-of-pocket
costs
and expenses prior to the distribution of any amounts to Lenders.  In
the event Agent is not reimbursed for such costs and expenses by Borrower
or its
Subsidiaries, each Lender hereby agrees that it is and shall be obligated
to pay
to Agent such Lender’s Pro Rata Share thereof.  Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify
upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or
on
behalf of Borrower and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do
so),
according to their Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all Indemnified
Liabilities; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for
the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities resulting solely from such Person’s gross negligence or willful
misconduct nor shall any Lender be liable for the obligations of any Defaulting
Lender in failing to make an Advance or other extension of credit
hereunder.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall
reimburse Agent upon demand for such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any costs or out
of pocket expenses (including attorneys, accountants, advisors, and consultants
fees and expenses) incurred by Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment, or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any
other
Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to
the
extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of
Borrower.  The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment
of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of
Agent.



15.8  Agent
in Individual Capacity.  WFF and its
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of,
accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in, and generally engage in any kind
of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and





BN
1225807v9




40


















Affiliates
and any other Person party to any Loan Documents as though WFF were not Agent
hereunder, and, in each case, without notice to or consent of the other members
of the Lender Group.  The other members of the Lender Group
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, WFF or its Affiliates may
receive
information regarding Borrower or its Affiliates or any other Person party
to
any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality obligations in favor
of
Borrower or such other Person and that prohibit the disclosure of such
information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge that, in such
circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such confidentiality
obligations, which waiver Agent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain),
Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to
them.  The terms “Lender” and “Lenders” include WFF in its individual
capacity.



15.9  Successor
Agent.  Agent may resign as Agent upon
45 days notice to the Lenders (unless such notice is waived by the Required
Lenders).  If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders
shall appoint a successor Agent for the Lenders.  If no successor
Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent,
Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders, a successor
Agent.  If Agent has materially breached or failed to perform any
material provision of this Agreement or of applicable law, the Required Lenders
may agree in writing to remove and replace Agent with a successor Agent from
among the Lenders.  In any such event, upon the acceptance of its
appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed
to
all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Agent and the term “Agent”
shall mean such successor Agent and the retiring Agent’s appointment, powers,
and duties as Agent shall be terminated.  After any retiring Agent’s
resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 15 shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while
it was Agent under this Agreement.  If no successor Agent has accepted
appointment as Agent by the date which is 45 days following a retiring Agent’s
notice of resignation, the retiring Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties
of
Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Lenders appoint a successor
Agent as provided for above.



15.10  Lender
in Individual Capacity.  Any Lender and
its respective Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for
the
account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or
other
business with Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and any other
Person
party to any Loan Documents as though such Lender were not a Lender hereunder
without notice to or consent of the other members of the Lender
Group.  The other members of the Lender Group acknowledge that,
pursuant to such activities, such Lender and its respective Affiliates may
receive information regarding Borrower or its Affiliates or any other Person
party to any Loan Documents that is subject to confidentiality obligations
in
favor of Borrower or such other Person and that prohibit the disclosure of
such
information to the Lenders, and the Lenders acknowledge that, in such
circumstances (and in the absence of a waiver of such confidentiality
obligations, which waiver such Lender will use its reasonable best efforts
to
obtain), such Lender shall not be under any obligation to provide such
information to them.



15.11  Collateral
Matters.



(a)  The
Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its sole
discretion, to release any Lien on any Collateral (i) upon the termination
of
the Commitments and payment and satisfaction in full by Borrower of all
Obligations, (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if a release
is required or desirable in connection therewith and if Borrower certifies
to
Agent that the sale or disposition is permitted under Section 6.4 of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents (and Agent may rely conclusively on
any
such certificate, without further inquiry), (iii) constituting property in
which
Borrower or its Subsidiaries owned no interest at the time the Agent’s Lien was
granted nor at any time thereafter, or (iv) constituting property leased to
Borrower or its Subsidiaries under a lease that has expired or is terminated
in
a transaction permitted under this Agreement.  Except as provided
above, Agent will not execute and deliver a release of any Lien on any
Collateral without the prior written authorization of (y) if the release
is of
all or substantially all of the Collateral, all of the Lenders, or (z)
otherwise, the Required Lenders.  Upon request by





BN
1225807v9




41


















Agent
or
Borrower at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing Agent’s authority to
release any such Liens on particular types or items of Collateral pursuant
to
this Section 15.11; provided, however, that (1) Agent shall
not be required to execute any document necessary to evidence such release
on
terms that, in Agent’s opinion, would expose Agent to liability or create any
obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Lien
without
recourse, representation, or warranty, and (2) such release shall not in
any
manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than
those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of Borrower in respect
of)
all interests retained by Borrower, including, the proceeds of any sale,
all of
which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.



(b)  Agent
shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the Lenders to assure that
the
Collateral exists or is owned by Borrower or its Subsidiaries or is cared
for,
protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent’s Liens have
been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected,
or
enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all
or in
any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity,
or to
continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or
available to Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood
and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event
related thereto, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, Agent
may
act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given Agent’s
own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and
that
Agent shall have no other duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender as to
any
of the foregoing, except as otherwise provided herein.



15.12  Restrictions
on Actions by Lenders; Sharing of Payments.



(a)  Each
of
the Lenders agrees that it shall not, without the express written consent
of
Agent, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully entitled to do so,
upon
the written request of Agent, set off against the Obligations, any amounts
owing
by such Lender to Borrower or its Subsidiaries or any deposit accounts of
Borrower or its Subsidiaries now or hereafter maintained with such
Lender.  Each of the Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless
specifically requested to do so in writing by Agent, take or cause to be
taken
any action, including, the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings
to
enforce any Loan Document against Borrower or any Guarantor or to foreclose
any
Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the
Collateral.



(b)  If,
at
any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, setoff,
or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to
the
Obligations, except for any such proceeds or payments received by such Lender
from Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from
Agent in excess of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of all such distributions by
Agent, such Lender promptly shall (A) turn the same over to Agent, in kind,
and
with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to Agent,
or in
immediately available funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the
Lenders and for application to the Obligations in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement, or (B) purchase, without recourse or warranty,
an
undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to the other
Lenders so that such excess payment received shall be applied ratably as
among
the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided,
however, that to the extent that such excess payment received by
the
purchasing party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases of
participations shall be rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and
the
applicable portion of the purchase price paid therefor shall be returned
to such
purchasing party, but without interest except to the extent that such purchasing
party is required to pay interest in connection with the recovery of the
excess
payment.



15.13  Agency
for Perfection.  Agent hereby appoints
each other Lender as its agent (and each Lender hereby accepts such appointment)
for the purpose of perfecting the Agent’s Liens in assets which, in accordance
with Article 8 or Article 9, as applicable, of the Code can be perfected
only by
possession or control.  Should any Lender obtain possession or control
of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly
upon Agent’s request therefor shall deliver possession or control of such
Collateral to Agent or in accordance with Agent’s instructions.





BN
1225807v9




42


















15.14  Payments
by Agent to the Lenders.  All payments
to be made by Agent to the Lenders shall be made by bank wire transfer of
immediately available funds pursuant to such wire transfer instructions as
each
party may designate for itself by written notice to
Agent.  Concurrently with each such payment, Agent shall identify
whether such payment (or any portion thereof) represents principal, premium,
fees, or interest of the Obligations.



15.15  Concerning
the Collateral and Related Loan
Documents.  Each member of the Lender
Group authorizes and directs Agent to enter into this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.  Each member of the Lender Group agrees that any
action taken by Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral and the exercise by Agent
of its
powers set forth therein or herein, together with such other powers that
are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be binding upon all of the
Lenders.



15.16  Field
Audits and Examination Reports; Confidentiality; Disclaimers by Lenders;
Other
Reports and Information.  By becoming a party to this
Agreement, each Lender:



(a)  is
deemed
to have requested that Agent furnish such Lender, promptly after it becomes
available, a copy of each field audit or examination report respecting Borrower
or its Subsidiaries (each a “Report” and collectively, “Reports”)
prepared by or at the request of Agent, and Agent shall so furnish each Lender
with such Reports,



(b)  expressly
agrees and acknowledges that Agent does not (i) make any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, and (ii) shall not be liable for
any
information contained in any Report,



(c)  expressly
agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not comprehensive audits or
examinations, that Agent or other party performing any audit or examination
will
inspect only specific information regarding Borrower and its Subsidiaries
and
will rely significantly upon Borrower’s and its Subsidiaries’ books and records,
as well as on representations of Borrower’s personnel,



(d)  agrees
to
keep all Reports and other material, non-public information regarding Borrower
and its Subsidiaries and their operations, assets, and existing and contemplated
business plans in a confidential manner in accordance with Section 17.9,
and



(e)  without
limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision contained
in this
Agreement, agrees:  (i) to hold Agent and any other Lender preparing a
Report harmless from any action the indemnifying Lender may take or fail
to take
or any conclusion the indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any Report
in
connection with any loans or other credit accommodations that the indemnifying
Lender has made or may make to Borrower, or the indemnifying Lender’s
participation in, or the indemnifying Lender’s purchase of, a loan or loans of
Borrower, and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and hold Agent,
and
any such other Lender preparing a Report harmless from and against, the claims,
actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses, and other amounts (including,
attorneys fees and costs) incurred by Agent and any such other Lender preparing
a Report as the direct or indirect result of any third parties who might
obtain
all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.



In
addition to the foregoing:  (x) any Lender may from time to time
request of Agent in writing that Agent provide to such Lender a copy of any
report or document provided by Borrower or its Subsidiaries to Agent that
has
not been contemporaneously provided by Borrower or such Subsidiary to such
Lender, and, upon receipt of such request, Agent promptly shall provide a
copy
of same to such Lender, (y) to the extent that Agent is entitled, under any
provision of the Loan Documents, to request additional reports or information
from Borrower or its Subsidiaries, any Lender may, from time to time, reasonably
request Agent to exercise such right as specified in such Lender’s notice to
Agent, whereupon Agent promptly shall request of Borrower





BN
1225807v9




43


















the
additional reports or information reasonably specified by such Lender, and,
upon
receipt thereof from Borrower or such Subsidiary, Agent promptly shall provide
a
copy of same to such Lender, and (z) any time that Agent renders to Borrower
a
statement regarding the Loan Account, Agent shall send a copy of such statement
to each Lender.



15.17  Several
Obligations; No
Liability.  Notwithstanding that certain
of the Loan Documents now or hereafter may have been or will be executed
only by
or in favor of Agent in its capacity as such, and not by or in favor of the
Lenders, any and all obligations on the part of Agent (if any) to make any
credit available hereunder shall constitute the several (and not joint)
obligations of the respective Lenders on a ratable basis, according to their
respective Commitments, to make an amount of such credit not to exceed, in
principal amount, at any one time outstanding, the amount of their respective
Commitments.  Nothing contained herein shall confer upon any Lender
any interest in, or subject any Lender to any liability for, or in respect
of,
the business, assets, profits, losses, or liabilities of any other
Lender.  Each Lender shall be solely responsible for notifying its
Participants of any matters relating to the Loan Documents to the extent
any
such notice may be required, and no Lender shall have any obligation, duty,
or
liability to any Participant of any other Lender.  Except as provided
in Section 15.7, no member of the Lender Group shall have any liability
for the acts of any other member of the Lender Group.  No Lender shall
be responsible to Borrower or any other Person for any failure by any other
Lender to fulfill its obligations to make credit available hereunder, nor
to
advance for it or on its behalf in connection with its Commitment, nor to
take
any other action on its behalf hereunder or in connection with the financing
contemplated herein.



16.  WITHHOLDING
TAXES.



(a)  All
payments made by Borrower hereunder or under any note or other Loan Document
will be made without setoff, counterclaim, or other defense.  In
addition, all such payments will be made free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for, any present or future Taxes, and in the event
any
deduction or withholding of Taxes is required, Borrower shall comply with
the
penultimate sentence of this Section 16(a).  “Taxes”
shall mean, any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments
or other
charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or
by
any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect
to
such payments (but excluding any tax imposed by any jurisdiction or by any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein measured by
or
based on the net income or net profits of any Lender) and all interest,
penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto.  If any Taxes
are so levied or imposed, Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of such
Taxes
and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of
all
amounts due under this Agreement, any note, or Loan Document, including any
amount paid pursuant to this Section 16(a) after withholding or deduction
for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided
for
herein; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be required to increase
any
such amounts if the increase in such amount payable results from Agent’s or such
Lender’s own willful misconduct or gross negligence (as finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction).  Borrower will furnish to Agent as
promptly as possible after the date the payment of any Tax is due pursuant
to
applicable law certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by
Borrower.



(b)  If
a
Lender claims an exemption from United States withholding tax, Lender agrees
with and in favor of Agent and Borrower, to deliver to Agent:



(i)  if
such
Lender claims an exemption from United States withholding tax pursuant to
its
portfolio interest exception, (A) a statement of the Lender, signed under
penalty of perjury, that it is not a (I) a “bank” as described in Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the IRC, (II) a 10% shareholder of Borrower (within the meaning
of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the IRC), or (III) a controlled foreign corporation
related to Borrower within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the IRC, and
(B)
a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN, before receiving its first
payment under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by
Agent
or Borrower;





BN
1225807v9




44


















(ii)  if
such
Lender claims an exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding tax under
a
United States tax treaty, properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN
before
receiving its first payment under this Agreement and at any other time
reasonably requested by Agent or Borrower;



(iii)  if
such
Lender claims that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United
States withholding tax because it is effectively connected with a United
States
trade or business of such Lender, two properly completed and executed copies
of
IRS Form W-8ECI before receiving its first payment under this Agreement and
at
any other time reasonably requested by Agent or Borrower; or



(iv)  such
other form or forms, including IRS Form W-9, as may be required under the
IRC or
other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or reduction
of, United States withholding or backup withholding tax before receiving
its
first payment under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested
by
Agent or Borrower.



Lender
agrees promptly to notify Agent and Borrower of any change in circumstances
which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
reduction.



(c)  If
a
Lender claims an exemption from withholding tax in a jurisdiction other than
the
United States, Lender agrees with and in favor of Agent and Borrower, to
deliver
to Agent any such form or forms, as may be required under the laws of such
jurisdiction as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, foreign
withholding or backup withholding tax before receiving its first payment
under
this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested by Agent or
Borrower.

Lender
agrees promptly to notify Agent and Borrower of any change in circumstances
which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
reduction.



(d)  If
any
Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax and such Lender
sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or
part of
the Obligations of Borrower to such Lender, such Lender agrees to notify
Agent
and Borrower of  the percentage amount in which it is no longer the
beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrower to such Lender.  To the
extent of such percentage amount, Agent and Borrower will treat such Lender’s
documentation provided pursuant to Sections 16(b) or 16(c) as no longer
valid.  With respect to such percentage amount, Lender may provide new
documentation, pursuant to Sections 16(b) or 16(c), if
applicable.



(e)  If
any
Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable withholding tax, Agent
may
withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to
the
applicable withholding tax after taking into account such
reduction.  If the forms or other documentation required by
subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 16 are not delivered to
Agent, then Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender not
providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the
applicable withholding tax.



(f)  If
the
IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other
jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent did not properly withhold tax from
amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender due to a failure on the
part of
the Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly
executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent of a change in
circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Lender shall indemnify and
hold
Agent harmless for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent, as
tax or
otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed
by
any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to Agent under this Section 16,
together with all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses).  The obligation of the Lenders under this subsection shall
survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement
of
Agent.

Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective when executed by Borrower,
Agent, and each Lender whose signature is provided for on the signature pages
hereof.



17.2  Section
Headings.  Headings and numbers have
been set forth herein for convenience only.  Unless the contrary is
compelled by the context, everything contained in each Section applies equally
to this entire Agreement.



17.3  Interpretation.  Neither
this Agreement
nor any
uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed against the Lender Group
or
Borrower, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise.  On the
contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed
and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as
to
accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties
hereto.



17.4  Severability
of Provisions.  Each provision of this
Agreement shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement
for
the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific
provision.



17.5  Bank
Product Providers.  Each Bank Product
Provider shall be deemed a party hereto for purposes of any reference in
a Loan
Document to the parties for whom Agent is acting; it being understood and
agreed
that the rights and benefits of such Bank Product Provider under the Loan
Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Provider’s right to share in
payments and collections out of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein.
In connection with any such distribution of payments and collections, Agent
shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Bank Product Provider
unless such Bank Product Provider has notified Agent in writing of the amount
of
any such liability owed to it prior to such distribution.



17.6  Debtor-Creditor
Relationship.  The relationship between
the Lenders and Agent, on the one hand, and Borrower, on the other hand,
is
solely that of creditor and debtor.  No member of the Lender Group has
(or shall be deemed to have) any fiduciary relationship or duty to Borrower
arising out of or in connection with, and there is no agency or joint venture
relationship between the members of the Lender Group, on the one hand, and
Borrower, on the other hand, by virtue of any Loan Document or any transaction
contemplated therein.



17.7  Counterparts;
Electronic Execution.  This Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on

be
deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute but one and the same Agreement.  Delivery of an executed
counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method
of
transmission shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement.  Any party delivering an executed
counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method
of
transmission also shall deliver an original executed counterpart of this
Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed counterpart shall
not
affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of this
Agreement.  The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document
mutatis mutandis.



17.8  Revival
and Reinstatement of Obligations.  If
the incurrence or payment of the Obligations by Borrower or Guarantor or
the
transfer to the Lender Group of any property should for any reason subsequently
be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law relating
to
creditors’ rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to
fraudulent conveyances, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable payments
of money or transfers of property (each, a “Voidable Transfer”), and if
the Lender Group is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any
such
Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the reasonable advice of its counsel,
then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that the Lender
Group is required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all reasonable
costs,
expenses, and attorneys





BN
1225807v9




46


















fees
of
the Lender Group related thereto, the liability of Borrower or Guarantor
automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored and shall exist
as
though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.



17.9  Confidentiality.



(a)  Agent
and
Lenders each individually (and not jointly or jointly and severally) agree

prohibited disclosure by Agent or the Lenders), (vi) in connection with any
assignment, participation  or pledge of any Lender’s interest under
this Agreement, provided that any such assignee, participant, or pledgee
shall
have agreed in writing to receive such information hereunder subject to the
terms of this Section, and (vii) in connection with any litigation or other
adversary proceeding involving parties hereto which such litigation or adversary
proceeding involves claims related to the rights or duties of such parties
under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  The provisions of this
Section 17.9(a) shall survive for 2 years after the payment in full of
the Obligations.

in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Agent may provide information
concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to loan syndication and pricing reporting services.

(signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”) hereby notifies the
Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is required to
obtain,

includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that
will
allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the

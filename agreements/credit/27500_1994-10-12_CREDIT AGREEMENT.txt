CREDIT AGREEMENT


To the Banks party hereto

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, Dean Foods Company, a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), applies to you for your several commitments, subject to all the
terms and conditions hereof and on the basis of the representations and
warranties hereinafter set forth, to make available a revolving credit as more
fully hereinafter set forth. Each of you is hereinafter referred to as a "Bank,"
all of you are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Banks," and Bank of
Montreal, Chicago Branch, in its capacity as agent for the Banks hereunder is
hereinafter referred to as the "Agent".

ARTICLE ONE

THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

Section 1.1. The Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each Bank, by its acceptance hereof, severally agrees to make a loan or loans
(individually a "Loan" and collectively, "Loans") to the Borrower from time to
time on a revolving basis in the amount of its commitment to make Loans set
forth on the applicable signature page hereof or pursuant to Section 12.12
hereof (its "Commitment" and cumulatively for all the Banks, the "Commitments")
(subject to any reductions thereof pursuant to the terms hereof) prior to the
Termination Date. The aggregate principal amount of Loans at any one time
outstanding shall in no event exceed the Commitments then in effect, which
Commitments on the date hereof total $150,000,000. Each Borrowing of Loans shall
be made ratably from the Banks in proportion to their respective Commitments.
The Borrower may elect that each Borrowing of loans be made available by means
of Domestic Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, which Loans may be repaid and the
principal amount thereof reborrowed prior to the Termination Date, subject to
all reductions in the Commitments pursuant to Article Two hereof and all other
terms and conditions hereof.

Section 1.2. Applicable Interest Rates.

(a) Domestic Rate Loans. Each Domestic Rate Loan made by a Bank shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, and actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the
date such Loan is made until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at
a rate per annum equal to the Domestic Rate from time to time in effect, payable
quarterly on the 15th day of each September, December, March and June in each
year and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise).

"Domestic Rate" means for any day the greater of:

(i) the rate of interest announced by the Agent from time to time as
its prime commercial rate, or equivalent, for United States Dollar loans to
borrowers located in the United States with any change in the Domestic Rate
resulting from a change in said prime commercial rate to be effective as of
the date of the relevant change in said prime commercial rate; and

(ii) the sum of (x) the rate for that day set forth opposite the
caption "Federal Fund (Effective)" in the daily statistical release
designated as "Composite 3:30 P.M. Quotations for U.S. Government
Securities," or any successor publication, Published by the Federal Reserve
Bank of
<PAGE>

New York or, if such publication shall be suspended or terminated, the rate
determined by the Agent (based on quotations received from two or more
Federal funds dealers of recognized standing) to be the prevailing rate per
annum (rounded upward, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100 of 1%) at
approximately 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) (or as soon thereafter as is
practicable) on such day for the purchase at face value of overnight Federal
funds in an amount approximately equal to the principal amount owed to the
Agent for which such rate is being determined, plus (y) 1/2 of 1% (0.50%).

(b) Eurodollar Loans. Each Eurodollar Loan made by a Bank shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed)
on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date such Loan is made until
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the
sum of 1/4 of 1% per annum (the "Eurodollar Margin") plus Adjusted LIBOR
applicable to such Loan, payable on the last day of the applicable Interest
Period and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). There shall not
be more than six separate Interest Periods applicable to outstanding Borrowings
at any one time.

"Adjusted LIBOR" means, for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, a rate per
annum determined in accordance with the following formula:

LIBOR
Adjusted LIBOR =  100% - Eurodollar Reserve Percentage

"LIBOR" means, with respect to an Interest Period for a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans, the average of the respective rates of interest per annum, as
determined by the Agent (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest whole
multiple of 1/16 of 1%), at which deposits of United States Dollars in
immediately available and freely transferable funds are offered to the Agent at
11:00 a.m. (London, England time) two Business Days prior to the commencement of
such Interest Period by major banks in the interbank eurodollar market for a
period equal to such Interest Period and in an amount equal to the principal
amount of the Eurodollar Loan scheduled to be made by the Agent as part of such
Borrowing.

"Eurodollar Reserve Percentage" means, for any Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans, the daily average for the applicable Interest Period of the maximum rate
at which reserves (including, without limitation, any supplemental, marginal and
emergency reserves) are imposed during such Interest Period by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) on "eurocurrency
liabilities," as defined in such Board's Regulation D, (or in respect of any
other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the
interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined or any category of extension of
credit or other assets that include loans by non-United States offices of any
Bank to United States residents) subject to any amendments of such reserve
requirement by such Board or its successor, taking into account any transitional
adjustments thereto. For purposes of this definition, the Eurodollar Loans shall
be deemed to be "eurocurrency liabilities" as defined in Regulation D without
benefit or credit for any prorations, exemptions or offsets under Regulation D.

"Interest Period" means the period commencing on the date a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans is made and ending on the date, as the Borrower may select 1, 2
or 3 weeks or 1, 2 or 3 months thereafter; provided, however, that:

(i) the Borrower may not select an Interest Period that extends beyond
the Termination Date; and

(ii) whenever the last day of any Interest Period would otherwise be a
day that is not a Business Day, the last day of such Interest Period shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, provided that, if such
extension would cause the last day of such Interest Period to occur in the

<PAGE>

following calendar month, the last day of such Interest Period shall be the
immediately preceding Business Day; and

(iii) for purposes of determining Interest Periods, a month means a
period starting on one day in a calendar month and ending on the numerically
corresponding day in the next calendar month; provided, however. that if
there is no numerically corresponding day in the month in which such an
Interest Period is to end, then such Interest Period shall end on the last
Business Day of the calendar month in which such Interest Period is to end.

(c) Rate Determinations. The Agent shall determine the Domestic Rate and
Adjusted LIBOR as applicable to the Loans hereunder (but the Borrower shall
select which of such rate options is to apply to each such Loan as provided in
Section 1.4 hereof), and its determination thereof shall be conclusive and
binding except in the case of manifest error or willful misconduct.

Section 1.3. Minimum Borrowing Amounts. Each Borrowing of Loans shall be in
an amount not less than $10,000,000, or any larger amount that is an integral
multiple of $1,000,000.

Section 1.4. Manner of Borrowing Loans.

(a) Notice to the Agent. The Borrower shall give telephonic or telecopy
notice to the Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable once given and, if by
telephone, shall be promptly confirmed in writing) by no later than 9:00 am.
(Chicago time) (i) on the date at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
date of each requested Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) on the date of any
requested Borrowing of Domestic Rate Loans. Each such notice shall specify the
date of the requested Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), the amount of
the requested Borrowing, the type of Loans to comprise such Borrowing and, if
such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period
applicable thereto. The Borrower agrees that the Agent may rely on any such
telephonic or telecopy notice given by any person it reasonably believes is an
Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent investigation and
in the event any notice by such means conflicts with any written confirmation,
such notice shall govern if the Agent has acted in reliance thereon.

(b) Notice to the Banks. The Agent shall give prompt telephonic, telex or
telecopy notice to each of the Banks of any Borrowing request received pursuant
to Section 1.4(a) above (but, if such notice is given by telephone, the Agent
shall confirm such borrowing request in writing) and, if such notice requests
the Banks to make Eurodollar Loans, the Agent shall give notice to the Borrower
and each of the Banks by like means of the interest rate applicable thereto
(but, if such notice is given by telephone, the Agent shall confirm such rate in
writing) promptly after the Agent has made such determination.

(c) Borrower's Failure to Notify. In the event the Borrower fails to give
notice pursuant to Section 1.4(a) above of the reborrowing of the principal
amount of any maturing Borrowing of Loans and has not notified the Agent by
10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the day such Borrowing matures that the Borrower
intends to repay such Borrowing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested
a Borrowing of Domestic Rate Loans on such day in the amount of the maturing
Borrowing of Loans, subject to Section 7.2 hereof.

(d) Disbursement of Loans. Not later than noon (Chicago time) on the date of
any Borrowing of Loans, each Bank shall, subject to Article Seven hereof, make
available its Loan in funds immediately available in Chicago, Illinois at the
principal office of the Agent, except to the extent such Borrowing is a
reborrowing, in whole or in part, of the principal amount of a maturing
Borrowing of Loans (a "Refunding Borrowing"), in which case each Bank shall
record the Loan made by it as a part of such Refunding Borrowing on its books
and records or on a schedule to its Note, as provided in Section 2.4(b) hereof,
and shall effect the repayment, in whole or in part, as appropriate, of its
maturing Loan through the proceeds of

<PAGE>

such new Loan. The Agent shall make the proceeds of each Borrowing available to
the Borrower at the Agent's principal office in Chicago, Illinois.

ARTICLE TWO
GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO LOANS;
REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS

Section 2.1. Maturity of Loans. Each Loan shall, unless required to be
sooner paid pursuant to any of the provisions hereof, mature and become due and
payable by the Borrower as follows: Domestic Rate Loans shall become due and
payable on the 90th day after the date made (but not later than the Termination
Date) and Eurodollar Loans shall become due and payable on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

Section 2.2. Prepayments. (a) Loans. The Borrower shall have the privilege
of prepaying without premium or penalty and in whole or in part (but, if in
part, then: (i) in an amount not less than $5,000,000 and in integral multiples
of $1,000,000 and (ii) in an amount such that the minimum amount required for a
Borrowing pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof remains outstanding) any Borrowing of
Loans at any time upon three Business Days', in the case of Eurodollar Loans, or
one Business Day's, in the case of Domestic Rate Loans, prior notice to the
Agent (which shall promptly advise each Bank of the receipt by it of each such
notice), such prepayment to be made by the payment of the principal amount to be
prepaid and accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for prepayment and, in
the case of Eurodollar Loans, any compensation required by Section 2.6 hereof.

(b) Reborrowings. Any amount paid or prepaid before the Termination Date
may, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be borrowed, repaid
and borrowed again.

Section 2.3. Default Rate. If any payment of principal on any Loan is not
made when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), such Loan shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed)
from the date such payment was due until paid in full, payable on demand, at a
rate per annum equal to:

(a) with respect to any Domestic Rate Loan, the sum of two percent
(2%) plus the Domestic Rate from time to time in effect; and

(b) with respect to any Eurodollar Loan the sum of two percent (2%)
plus the rate of interest in effect thereon at the time of such default
until the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, thereafter, the
sum of two percent (2%) plus the Domestic Rate from time to time in effect.

Section 2.4. The Notes. (a) All Loans made to the Borrower by each Bank
shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the Borrower payable to such
Bank in the amount of its Commitment and otherwise in the form of Exhibit A
hereto. Each such promissory note is hereinafter referred to as a "Note" and
collectively as the "Notes".

(b) Each Bank shall record on its books and records or on a schedule to its
Note the amount and type of each Loan made by it to the Borrower, all payments
of principal and the principal balance from time to time outstanding thereon and
in respect of any Eurodollar Loan, the Interest Period and interest rate
applicable thereto; provided that prior to the transfer of any Note all such
amounts shall be recorded on a schedule to such Note. The record thereof,
whether shown on such books and records of a Bank or on a schedule to any Note,
shall be prima facie evidence as to all such amounts; provided however, that the
failure of any Bank to record any of the foregoing or any error in any such
record shall not limit or

<PAGE>

otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay all Loans made to it
hereunder together with accrued interest thereon.

Section 2.5. Commitment Terminations. (a) Optional. The Borrower shall have
the right at any time and from time to time, upon five (5) Business Days' prior
written notice to the Agent, to terminate without premium or penalty, in whole
or in part, the Commitments, any partial termination to be in an amount not less
than $10,000,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000, and to reduce ratably the respective Commitments of each Bank;
provided that the Commitments may not be reduced to an amount less than the
aggregate principal amount of Loans then outstanding. Any termination of
Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.5 may not be reinstated.

(b) Mandatory. The Commitments shall automatically reduce ratably by the net
proceeds received by the Borrower or any Subsidiary from the issuance of
Indebtedness with a final scheduled maturity of one year or more, exclusive of
Indebtedness issued to finance the acquisition or construction of a fixed asset
(including Indebtedness issued for such purposes in the form of Capitalized
leases and industrial development revenue bonds), Indebtedness of Subsidiaries
existing at the time they become Subsidiaries and notes issued by the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries to sellers of stock or other assets to the Borrower
or its Subsidiaries evidencing the deferred portion of the purchase price for
the stock or other assets in question. The Borrower shall promptly notify the
Agent of each incurrence of Indebtedness giving rise to a reduction in the
Commitments pursuant hereto with such reduction to become effective on the date
the Borrower or Subsidiary in question receives the proceeds of the Indebtedness
giving rise to the reduction. On the date of each such reduction the Borrower
shall repay outstanding Loans to the extent the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Loans exceed the Commitments as so reduced. If any such repayment
would require the Borrower to make a reimbursement payment to the Banks under
Section 2.6 hereof, the Borrower may at its option, in lieu of such payment,
deliver the amount of the required payment to the Agent to be held by it for
application to the Loans on the first date when such a repayment can be effected
without requiring the Borrower to make a payment under Section 2.6 hereof. In
such event, the funds so held by the Agent shall, at the option of the Borrower,
be invested in high-grade investment securities mutually acceptable to the
Borrower and the Agent.

(c) Change in Control. After the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
Required Banks may at any time, but in no event later than 30 days after the
date the Borrower notifies the Banks of such Change in Control, terminate the
Commitments effective on the Business Day after the day the Borrower receives
notice of such termination. Any Loans outstanding on the date the Commitments
are so terminated, together with all other amounts owing hereunder, shall be due
and payable on such date.

Section 2.6. Funding Indemnity. In the event any Bank shall incur any loss,
cost or expense (including, without limitation, any loss of profit, and any
loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund or maintain any Eurodollar
Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid
to such Bank) as a result of:

(a) any payment or prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan on a date other
than the last day of its Interest Period for any reason,

(b) any failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of
Article Seven or otherwise) by the Borrower to borrow a Eurodollar Loan on
the date specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.

(c) any failure by the Borrower to make any payment of principal on
any Eurodollar Loan when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), or


<PAGE>

(d) any acceleration of the maturity of a Eurodollar Loan as a result of
the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder,

then, upon the demand of such Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
amount as will reimburse such Bank for such loss, cost or expense. If any Bank
makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to the Borrower, with a
copy to the Agent, a certificate executed by an officer of such Bank setting
forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including
an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or
expense), and the amounts shown on such certificate if reasonably calculated
shall be conclusive.

ARTICLE THREE

FEES

Section 3.1. Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
ratable account of the Banks a commitment fee at the rate of 1/4 of 1% per annum
(computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the
actual number of days elapsed) on the average daily unused amount of the
Commitments hereunder, such fee being payable in arrears on September 15, 1994,
on the 15th day of each December, March, June and September thereafter and on
the Termination Date, unless the Commitments are terminated in whole on an
earlier date, in which event the commitment fee for the period to the date of
such termination in whole shall be paid on the date of such termination.

Section 3.2. Closing Fee. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to the initial
Borrowing set forth in Section 7.1 hereof, the Borrower shall pay to the Agent
for its own use and benefit the nonrefundable closing fee heretofore agreed to
between the Agent and the Borrower.

ARTICLE FOUR

PLACE AND APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS

Section 4.1. Place and Application of Payments. All payments of principal of
and interest on the Loans, of the commitment fee and of all other amounts
payable under this Agreement by the Borrower shall be made to the Agent by no

Chicago, Illinois (or such other location in the State of Illinois as the Agent
may designate to the Borrower) for the benefit of the Banks. Any payments
received after such time shall be deemed to have been received by the Agent on
the next Business Day. All such payments shall be made in lawful money of the
United States of America, in immediately available funds at the place of
payment, without setoff or counterclaim. The Agent will promptly thereafter
cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or
interest on Loans or fees ratably to the Banks and like funds relating to the

applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE SIX
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Borrower represents and warrants to the Banks as follows:

Section 6.1. Organization and Qualification. The Borrower is duly organized
and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, has full and adequate corporate power to carry on its business as now
conducted, is duly licensed or qualified and in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business transacted by it or the nature
of the Property owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified and in good
standing would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
Property, business or operations of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

Section 6.2. Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized
and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it was incorporated, has full and adequate corporate power to carry on its
business as now conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business transacted by
it or the nature of the Property owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
and in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or Property, business or operations of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Schedule 6.2 correctly sets forth, as to each
Subsidiary which is operating or has material assets, the

<PAGE>

jurisdiction of its incorporation, the percentage of issued and outstanding
shares of each class of its capital stock owned by the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries and, if such percentage is not 100% (excluding directors'
qualifying shares as required by law), a description of each class of its
authorized capital stock and the number of shares of each class issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Subsidiary are validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and nonassessable
and all such shares indicated in Schedule 6.2 as owned by the Borrower or a
Subsidiary are owned, beneficially and of record, by the Borrower or such
Subsidiary, free of any Lien.

Section 6.3. Corporate Authority and Validity of Obligations. The Borrower
has full right and authority to enter into this Agreement, to make the
borrowings herein provided for, to issue its Notes in evidence thereof and to
perform all of its obligations hereunder and under the Notes; this Agreement and
each Note delivered by the Borrower have been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Borrower and constitute valid and binding obligations of the
Borrower enforceable in accordance with their terms; and this Agreement and the
Notes do not, nor does the performance or observance by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of any of the matters or things therein provided for, contravene any
provision of law or any charter or by-law provision of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or any material covenant, indenture or agreement of or affecting the
Borrower or any Subsidiary or a substantial portion of their respective
Properties.

Section 6.4. Not an Investment Company. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Section 6.5. Margin Stock. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
is engaged principally, or as one of its primary activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock, and
neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries will use the proceeds of any
Loan in a manner that violates any provision of Regulation U or X of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Section 6.6. Financial Reports. The consolidated statement of financial
condition of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as at May 29, 1994 and the
related statements of consolidated income and consolidated cash flows of the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries for the year then ended and accompanying notes
thereto, which financial statements are accompanied by the report of Price
Waterhouse, independent public accountants, and heretofore furnished to the
Banks, fairly presents the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and
the Subsidiaries as at such date and their consolidated results of operations
and consolidated cash flows for the period then ended in conformity with GAAP.

Section 6.7. No Material Adverse Change. Since May 29, 1994, there has been
no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or business
prospects of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 6.8. Litigation. There is no litigation or governmental proceeding
pending, nor to the knowledge of the Borrower threatened, against the Borrower
or any Subsidiary which if adversely determined would (a) impair the validity or
enforceability of, or materially impair the ability of the Borrower to perform
its obligations under, this Agreement or the Notes or (b), except as disclosed
in the Borrower's Form IO-K filed with the SEC covering the period through May
29, 1994 (or in any such Reports hereafter delivered to the Banks pursuant to
Section 8.5(a) or 8.5(b) hereof or disclosed from time to time pursuant to
Section 8.5(d)(iii) hereof), result in any material adverse change in the
financial condition or Property, business or operations of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 6.9. Tax Returns. The consolidated United States federal income tax
returns of the Borrower for the taxable year ended May 28, 1989 and for all
taxable years ended prior to said date have been examined by the Internal
Revenue Service and have been approved as filed, and any additional


<PAGE>

assessments in connection with any of such years have been paid or the
applicable statute of limitations therefor has expired. There are no
assessments in respect of the consolidated United States federal income tax
returns of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries of a material nature for any
taxable year ended after May 28, 1989 pending, nor to the knowledge of the
Borrower is any such assessment threatened, other than for those which are
provided for by adequate reserves under GAAP.

Section 6.10. Approvals. No authorization, consent, license, exemption or
filing or registration with any court or governmental department, agency or
instrumentality, or any approval or consent of the stockholders of the Borrower
or from any other Person, is necessary to the valid execution, delivery or
performance by the Borrower of this Agreement or the Notes.

Section 6.11. Liens. There are no Liens on any of the Property of the Borrower
or any SUBSIDIARY, except those permitted by Section 8.11 hereof.

Section 6.12. ERISA. The Borrower and each Subsidiary are in compliance in all
material respects with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), to the extent applicable to them and have received no notice
to the contrary from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") or any
other governmental entity or agency. As of May 29, 1994 the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries would not have any liability to PBGC in respect of Unfunded Vested
Liabilities if all employee pension benefit plans maintained by the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries had been terminated as of such date. No condition exists or
event or transaction has occurred with respect to any Plan which could
reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary of any material liability, fine or penalty. Except as disclosed to
the Banks in writing, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any contingent
liability with respect to any post-retirement benefits under a Welfare Plan,
other than liability for continuation coverage described in Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA.

Section 6.13. Environmental and Health Matters. In the ordinary course of its
business, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries conduct an ongoing review of the
effect of Environmental and Health Laws on the properties and all aspects of the
business and operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the course of
which the Borrower identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs
(including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required
for clean-up or closure of properties currently or previously owned, any capital
or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with
standards imposed by law and any actual or potential liabilities to third
parties, including employees or governmental entities, and any related costs and
expenses). On the basis of this review, the Borrower has reasonably concluded
that Environmental and Health Laws are unlikely to have any material adverse
effect on the financial condition or Property, business or operations of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

its properties, which exceptions, encumbrances, easements, reservations,
rights and restrictions do not in the aggregate materially detract from the
value of such properties or materially impair their use in the operation of
the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; and

(e) Other Liens on fixed assets securing Indebtedness incurred to
finance the acquisition of the fixed assets in question and being in an
aggregate principal amount not exceeding at any time 5% of the Borrower's
and Subsidiaries' consolidated assets.

Section 8.12.  Use of Proceeds. The Borrower shall only use the proceeds of
the Loans to refinance short term Indebtedness of the Borrower and for other
general corporate purposes not involving the refinancing of Indebtedness. In no
event will the Borrower use the proceeds of any Loan to finance the acquisition
of equity securities in any Person if such securities are acquired in connection
with an effort to acquire a controlling equity interest in such Person and the
Board of Directors (or other persons exercising similar functions) of the issuer
of such securities disapproves of such acquisition and recommends to the holders
of such securities that they reject such acquisition of a controlling interest.

Section 8.13.  Compliance with Laws. Without limiting any of the other
covenants of the Borrower in this Article Eight, the Borrower will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, conduct its business, and otherwise be, in
compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances and orders of any
governmental or judicial authorities, non-compliance with which would (a) impair
the validity or enforceability or the ability of the Borrower to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or the Notes or (b) result in any material
adverse change in the financial condition or Properties, business or operations
of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

ARTICLE TEN
CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

Section 10.1. Change of Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement or any Note, if at any time after the date hereof any change in
applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof makes it unlawful
for any Bank to make or continue to maintain Eurodollar Loans or to give effect
to its obligations as contemplated hereby, such Bank shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Borrower, with a copy to the Agent, and such Bank's obligations
to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans under this Agreement shall terminate until
it is no longer unlawful for such Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans. The
Borrower shall, if but only if, the continued maintenance of the then
outstanding Eurodollar Loans is unlawful, prepay on demand the outstanding
principal amount of any such affected Eurodollar Loans, together with all
interest accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to such Bank
under this Agreement; provided however, subject to all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may then elect to borrow the
principal amount of the affected Eurodollar Loan from such Bank by means of a
Domestic Rate Loan from such Bank that shall not be made ratably by the Banks
but only from such affected Bank.

Section 10.2. Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain, or
Inadequacy of, LIBOR. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for
any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans:

(a) the Agent determines that deposits in United States Dollars (in
the applicable amounts) are not being offered to it in the eurodollar
interbank market for such Interest Period, or

(b) the Required Banks advise the Agent that LIBOR as determined by
the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of
funding their Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period,

then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to
make Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended.

Section 10.3. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If on or after the date
hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change
therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its
Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force
of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

<PAGE>

(i) shall subject any Bank (or its Lending Office) to any tax, duty or
other charge with respect to its Eurodollar Loans, its Notes or its
obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or shall change the basis of taxation
of payments to any Bank (or its Lending Office) of the principal of or
interest on its Eurodollar Loans or any other amounts due under this
Agreement in respect of its Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make
Eurodollar Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net
income of such Bank or its Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in
which such Bank's principal executive office or Lending Office is located);
or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement (including, without limitation, any such
requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
but excluding with respect to any Eurodollar Loans any such requirement
included in an applicable Eurodollar Reserve Percentage) against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or
its Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Lending Office) or
on the interbank market any other condition affecting its Eurodollar Loans,
its Notes or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or
its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan, or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending
Office) under this Agreement or under its Notes with respect thereto, by an
amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within fifteen (15) days after
demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall be obligated
to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Bank for such increased cost or reduction provided, however, that such Bank
shall promptly notify the Borrower of an event which might cause it to seek
compensation, and the Borrower shall be obligated to pay only such
compensation which is incurred or arises subsequent to the date which is 30 days
prior to the date such notice is given.

(b) If after the date hereof, any Bank shall have determined that the
adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy,
or any change therein (including, without limitation, any revisions in the Final
Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (12 CFR part 208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225, Appendix A) or of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR Part 3, Appendix A), or in any
other applicable capital rules heretofore adopted and issued by any governmental
authority), or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its
Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Bank's capital, or on the capital of any corporation controlling such
Bank, as a consequence of it obligations hereunder to a level below that which
such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance
(taking into consideration such Bank's policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to
time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the
Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.

(c) Each Bank that determines to seek compensation under this Section 10.3
shall notify the Borrower and the Agent of the circumstances that entitle the
Bank to such compensation pursuant to this Section 10.3 and will designate a
different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce
the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming
compensation under this Section 10.3 and setting forth the computation of the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which computation shall
be prima facie correct. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

<PAGE>

Section 10.4. Lending Offices. Each Bank may, at its option, elect to make
its Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified on the
appropriate signature page hereof (each a "Lending Office") for each type of
Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates
as it may from time to time elect and designate in a notice to the Borrower and
the Agent; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be liable for any
increased cost which a Bank would not have incurred but for its change in
Lending Offices unless the Borrower has consented to such change.

Section 10.5. Discretion of Bank as to Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each Bank shall be entitled to fund and
maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees fit,
it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all
determinations hereunder shall be made as if each Bank had actually funded and
maintained each Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of deposits in the
eurodollar interbank market having a maturity corresponding to such Loan's
Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to LIBOR for such Interest
Period.

Section 10.6. Substitution of Bank. If (a) the obligation of any Bank to
make Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 10.1, (b) any Bank
has demanded compensation or given notice of its intention to demand
compensation under Section 10.3 or (c) the Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Bank pursuant to Section 12.1, and in any such case
the Required Banks are not in the same situation, the Borrower shall have the
right, with the assistance of the Agent if desired, to seek a mutually
satisfactory substitute bank or banks (which may be one or more of the Banks) to
replace such Bank under this Agreement. The Bank to be so replaced shall
cooperate with the Borrower and substitute bank to accomplish such substitution
on the terms of Section 12.12 hereof, other than the minimum assignment amount
(which shall not apply), provided that such Bank's entire Commitment is
replaced.

ARTICLE ELEVEN
THE AGENT

Section 11.1. Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank hereby irrevocably
appoints Bank of Montreal, Chicago Branch its Agent under this Agreement and
hereby authorizes the Agent to take such action as Agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the
terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

Section 11.2. Agent and Affiliates. The Agent shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from
exercising the same as though it were not the Agent, and the Agent and its
affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the
Borrower as if it were not the Agent hereunder. The term Bank as used herein,
unless the context otherwise clearly requires, includes the Agent in its
individual capacity as a Bank. References in Section l hereof to the Agent's
Loans, or to the amount owing to the Agent for which an interest rate is being
determined, refer to the Agent in its individual capacity as a Bank.

Section 11.3. Action by the Agent. The obligations of the Agent under this
Agreement are only those expressly set forth herein. In no event shall the Agent
be required to take any action in violation of applicable law or of any
provision of this Agreement, and the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified
in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless the Agent shall be indemnified to
its reasonable satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action. In all cases in which this Agreement does not require the Agent
to take certain actions, the Agent shall be fully justified in using its
discretion in failing to take or in taking any action hereunder. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall not be required to
take any action with respect to any Event of Default, except as expressly
provided in Section 9.2. The Agent

<PAGE>

shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default until
it receives written notice thereof from the Borrower or a Bank specifically
identified as a "notice of default". The Agent shall be acting as an
independent contractor hereunder and nothing herein shall be deemed to impose on
the Agent any fiduciary obligations to the Banks or the Borrower.

Section 11.4. Consultation with Experts. The Agent may consult with legal
counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and
shall not be liable to the Banks for any action taken or omitted to be taken by
it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
experts.

Section 11.5. Liability of Agent. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or
not taken by it in connection herewith (i) with the consent or at the request of
the Required Banks or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or
employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into
or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with
this Agreement or any Borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of
any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of
any condition specified in Article Seven, except receipt of items required to be
delivered to the Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of
this Agreement, the Notes or any other instrument or writing furnished in
connection herewith. The Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in
reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, request or statement (whether
written or oral) or other document believed by it to be genuine or to be sent by
the proper party or parties and, in the case of legal matters, in relying on the
advice of counsel (including counsel for the Borrower). The Agent may treat the
Banks named herein as the holders of the Notes and of the indebtedness
contemplated herein unless and until the Agent receives notice of the assignment
of the Note and the indebtedness held by a Bank hereunder pursuant to an
assignment contemplated by Section 12.11 or 12.12 hereof.

Section 11.6. Indemnification. Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance with
its Commitment (or, if the Commitments have been terminated in whole, ratably in
accordance with its Commitment as of the date of such termination in whole),
indemnify the Agent, its directors, officers, agents, and employees (to the
extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including
counsels' fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss, obligation,
damages, penalties, judgments, suits or liability (except such as result from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party claiming
indemnification) that any of them may suffer or incur in connection with this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by any of them hereunder or in
connection herewith.

Section 11.7. Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking any action under this Agreement. Except for notices, reports and
other documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks
by the Agent hereunder the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any of their affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Agent or any
of its affiliates.

Section 11.8. Resignation of Agent and Successor Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent may
resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the
Borrower, and the Required Banks may remove the Agent, with the consent of the
Borrower, at any time with or without cause. Upon any such resignation or
removal of the Agent, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint, with
the consent of the Borrower, a successor Agent. If no

<PAGE>

successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks, and shall
have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring
Agent's giving of notice of resignation or receiving notice of its removal, then
the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which
shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of
America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $200,000,000. Upon the acceptance by a successor Agent of its appointment
as Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any
retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Article Eleven shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent.

Section 11.9. Payments. Unless the Agent shall have been notified by a Bank
prior to the date on which such Bank is scheduled to make payment to the Agent
of the proceeds of a Loan (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that
such Bank does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such
Bank has made such payment when due and the Agent may in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the Borrower the
proceeds of the Loan to be made by such Bank and, if any Bank has not in fact
made such payment to the Agent, such Bank shall, on demand, pay to the Agent the
amount made available to the Borrower attributable to such Bank together with
interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date
such amount was made available to the Borrower and ending on (but excluding) the
date such Bank pays such amount to the Agent at a rate per annum equal to the
Federal Funds Rate. If such amount is not received from such Bank by the Agent
immediately upon demand, the Borrower will, on demand, repay to the Agent the
proceeds of the Loan attributable to such Bank with interest thereon at a rate
per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan, but
without such payment being considered a payment or prepayment of a Loan, so that
the Borrower will have no liability under Section 2.7 hereof with respect to
such payment. "Federal Funds Rate" shall mean the "Federal Funds (Effective)"
rate described in clause (ii) of Section 1.2(a) hereof.

ARTICLE TWELVE
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 12.1. Withholding Taxes.

(a) Payments Free of Withholding. Except as otherwise required by law and
subject to Section 12.1(b) hereof, each payment by the Borrower under this
Agreement or the Notes shall be made without withholding for or on account of
any present or future taxes (other than overall net income taxes on the
recipient) imposed on a Bank by or within the jurisdiction in which the Borrower
is domiciled, any jurisdiction from which the Borrower makes any payment, or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. If any such
withholding is so required, the Borrower shall make the withholding, pay the
amount withheld to the appropriate governmental authority before penalties
attached thereto or interest accrues thereon and forthwith pay such additional
amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by
each Bank and the Agent free and clear of such taxes (including such taxes on
such additional amount) is equal to the amount which that Bank or the Agent (as
the case may be) would have received had such withholding not been made. If the
Agent or any Bank pays any amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or
interest the Borrower shall reimburse the Agent or that Bank for that payment on
demand in the currency in which such payment was made. If the Borrower pays any
such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver official tax receipts
evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof to the Bank or Agent on
whose account such withholding was made (with a copy to the Agent if not the
recipient of the original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment. If any
Bank or the Agent determines it has received or been granted a credit against or
relief or remission for, or repayment of, any taxes paid or payable by it
because of any taxes, penalties or interest paid by the Borrower and evidenced
by such a tax receipt, such Bank or Agent shall, to the extent it can do so
without prejudice to the retention

<PAGE>

of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the
Borrower such amount as such Bank or Agent determines is attributable to such
deduction or withholding and which will leave such Bank or Agent (after such
payment) in no better or worse position than it would have been in if the
Borrower had not been required to make such deduction or withholding. Nothing in
this Agreement shall interfere with the right of each Bank and the Agent to
arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige any Bank or
the Agent to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any
computations in connection with such taxes.

(b) U.S. Withholding Tax Exemptions. Each Bank that is not a United States
person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit
to the Borrower and the Agent on or before the earlier of the date the initial
Borrowing is made hereunder and thirty (30) days after the date hereof, two duly
completed and signed copies of either Form 1001 (relating to such Bank and
entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding under the Code on all
amounts to be received by such Bank, including fees, pursuant to this Agreement
and the Loans) or Form 4224 (relating to all amounts to be received by such
Bank, including fees, pursuant to this Agreement and the Loans) of the United
States Internal Revenue Service. Thereafter and from time to time, each Bank
shall submit to the Borrower and the Agent such additional duly completed and
signed copies of one or the other of such Forms (or such successor forms as
shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing
authorities) as may be (i) requested of such Bank by the Borrower, directly or
through the Agent, and (ii) required under then-current United States law or
regulations to avoid or reduce United States withholding taxes on payments in
respect of all amounts to be received by such Bank, including fees, pursuant to
this Agreement or the Loans. Upon the request of the Borrower, each Bank that is
a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code) shall submit to the Borrower a certificate to the effect that it is such a
United States person.

(c) Inability of Bank to Submit Forms. If any Bank determines, as a result
of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any official
application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to submit to the
Borrower or Agent any form or certificate that such Bank is obligated to submit
pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 12.1 or that such Bank is required to
withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted or any such
form or certificate otherwise becomes ineffective or inaccurate, such Bank shall
promptly notify the Borrower and Agent of such fact and, without affecting the
Borrower's obligations hereunder, the Bank shall to that extent not be obligated
to provide any such form or certificate and will be entitled to withdraw or
cancel any affected form or certificate, as applicable.

Section 12.2. No Waiver of Rights. No delay or failure on the part of any
Bank or on the part of the holder or holders of any Note in the exercise of any
power or right shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor as an acquiescence in any
default, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other power or right, and the rights and remedies
hereunder of the Banks and of the holder or holders of any Notes are cumulative
to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would
otherwise have.

Section 12.3. Non-Business Day. If any payment of principal or interest on
any Loan or of any fee hereunder shall fall due on a day which is not a Business
Day, interest at the rate such Loan bears for the period prior to maturity or at
the rate such fee accrues shall continue to accrue from the stated due date
thereof to and including the next succeeding Business Day, on which the same
shall be payable.

Section 12.4. Documentary Taxes. The Borrower agrees that it will pay any
documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable in respect of this Agreement or any
Note, including interest and penalties, in the event any such taxes are assessed
irrespective of when such assessment is made and whether or not any credit is
then in use or available hereunder.

<PAGE>

Section 12.5. Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties made herein or in certificates given pursuant hereto shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and of the Notes, and shall
continue in full force and effect with respect to the date as of which they were
made as long as any credit is in use or available hereunder.

Section 12.6. Survival of Indemnities. All indemnities and all other
provisions relative to reimbursement to the Banks of amounts sufficient to
protect the yield of the Banks with respect to the Loans, including, but not
limited to, Section 2.6 and Section 10.3 hereof, shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and the Notes.

Section 12.7. Sharing of Set-Off. Each Bank agrees with each other Bank that
if such Bank receives and retains any payment of principal or interest, whether
by set-off or application of deposit balances or otherwise ("Set-off"), on any
of its Loans outstanding under this Agreement in excess of its ratable share of
such payments on all Loans, then such Bank shall purchase for cash at face
value, but without recourse, ratably from each of the other Banks such amount of
the Loans held by each such other Bank (or interest therein) as shall be
necessary to cause such Bank to share such excess payment ratably with all the
other Banks; provided, however, that if any such purchase is made by any Bank,
and if such excess payment or part thereof is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Bank, the related purchases from the other Banks shall be rescinded
ratably and the purchase price restored as to the portion of such excess payment
so recovered, together with any interest assessed against the purchasing Bank
thereon. Each Bank's ratable share of any such Set-off shall be determined by
the proportion that the aggregate amount of Loans then due and payable to such
Bank bears to the total aggregate amount of the Loans then due and payable to
all the Banks.

Section 12.8. Notices. Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices
hereunder shall be in writing (including cable, telecopy or telex) and shall be
given to the relevant party at its address, telecopier number or telex number
set forth below, in the case of the Borrower, or on the appropriate signature
page hereof, in the case of the Banks and the Agent, or such other address,
telecopier number or telex number as such party may hereafter specify by notice

Section 12.10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
the Borrower and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of
each of the Banks and of the Agent and the benefit of their respective
successors and assigns, including any subsequent holder of any Note. The
Borrower may not assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
written consent of all of the Banks.

Section 12.11. Participants and Note Assignees. Each Bank shall have the
right at its own cost to grant participations (to be evidenced by one or more
agreements or certificates of participation) in the Loans made, and/or
Commitment held, by such Bank at any time and from time to time, and to assign
its rights under such Loans or the Note evidencing such Loans to one or more
other Persons; provided that no such participation or assignment shall relieve
any Bank of any of its obligations under this Agreement, and provided further
that no such assignee or participant shall have any rights under this Agreement
except as provided in this Section 12.11, and the Agent shall have no obligation
or responsibility to such participant or assignee, except that nothing herein
provided is intended to affect the rights of an assignee of a Note to enforce
the Note assigned. Any party to which such a participation or assignment has
been granted shall have the benefits of Section 2.6 and Section 10.3 hereof but
shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under either such Section
than the Bank granting such participation or assignment would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the rights transferred. No assignee shall be entitled
to any of the benefits of subparts (a) and (c) of Section 12.1 hereof unless it
complies with the terms of subpart (b) of Section 12.1.

Section 12.12. Assignment of Commitments by Banks. Bank of Montreal shall
have the right at any time, with the prior written consent of Borrower (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to sell, assign,
transfer or negotiate all or any part of its Commitment to one or more
commercial banks or other financial institutions; provided that such assignment
is in an amount of at least $10,000,000. Upon any such assignment, and its
notification to the Agent, the assignee shall become a Bank hereunder, all Loans
and the Commitment it thereby holds shall be governed by all the terms and
conditions hereof, and Bank of Montreal shall have its Commitment, and its
obligations and rights in connection therewith, reduced by the amount of such
assignment and new Notes shall be issued to the assignor and assignee in the
amounts of their respective Commitments after giving effect to the assignment.
If any assignee is not a United States person, the Borrower may withhold its
consent to any assignment unless such assignee complies with Section 12.1(b)
hereof.

Section 12.13. Amendments. Any provision of this Agreement or the Notes may
be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed by (a) the Borrower, (b) the Required Banks, and (c) if the rights or
duties of the Agent are affected thereby, the Agent; provided that:

(i) no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section shall (A) increase
any Commitment of any Bank without the consent of such Bank or (B) reduce
the amount of or postpone the date for payment of any principal of or
interest on any Loan or of any fee payable hereunder without the consent of
the Bank to which such payment is owing or which has committed to make such
Loan hereunder; and

(ii) no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section shall, unless
signed by each Bank, change the provisions of this Section, the definition
of Required Banks or Termination Date, any condition precedent set forth in
Article Seven hereof or the provisions of Section 9.1.(h), 9.1.(i) or 9.3,
or affect the number of Banks required to take any action under this
Agreement.

each Bank and the Agent, its directors, officers and employees against all

judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitations, all
expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not any Bank or the
Agent is a party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any Note, the transactions contemplated hereby or
the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of
any Loan hereunder, other than those which arise from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party claiming indemnification. The obligations of the
Borrower under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Section 12.15. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and
the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties hereto, shall be construed
and determined in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois,
without regard to conflict of laws doctrine. The Borrower hereby submits to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois and of any Illinois state court sitting in the City of
Chicago for the purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought
in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

Section 12.16. Headings. Article and Section headings used in this Agreement
are for reference only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.

Section 12.17. One Bank. If and so long as Bank of Montreal is the only Bank
hereunder, Bank of Montreal shall have all rights, powers and privileges
afforded the Agent, the Banks or the Required Banks hereunder.

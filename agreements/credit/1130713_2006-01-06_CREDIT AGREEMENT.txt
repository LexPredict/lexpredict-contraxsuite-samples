Exhibit 10.1





Seventh Modification to Credit Agreement





This Seventh
Modification to Credit Agreement Note (this “Modification”) is entered into as
of December 31, 2005, by and between OVERSTOCK.COM, INC., a Delaware
corporation (“Borrower”), and WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“Bank”).





Recitals:





A.    Bank has agreed to extend
credit to Borrower in the maximum principal amount of $30,000,000.00 pursuant
to the terms and conditions of that certain Credit Agreement dated as of
February 13, 2004 and a related Revolving Line of Credit Note dated December
22, 2004, executed by Borrower and payable to the order of Bank, as amended
most recently by a Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement dated October 18, 2005
(as amended, the “Agreement” and the “Note”).





B.    The obligations of Borrower
under the Agreement and the Note are secured by the security interests and
liens granted by Borrower pursuant to (1) a Security Agreement: Securities
Account, (2) an Addendum to Securities Agreement: Securities Account, and (3) a
Securities Account Control Agreement, all dated as of October 18, 2005 (which,
together with all other security agreements and control agreements in favor of
Bank, shall be referred to as the “Security Agreement”).  The Agreement, the Note and the Security
Agreement shall be referred to collectively as the “Loan Documents.”





C.    The security interests granted
by the Security Agreement includes a security interest in two (2) fixed income
securities bearing the guaranty of Bayerische Landesbank, with respective
maturity dates of September 20, 2006 and November 1, 2006 (collectively the “Fixed
Income Investments”).





D.    Bank
and Borrower have agreed (1) to extend the termination date of the line of
credit represented by the Agreement and the maturity date of the Note to
December 31, 2007 and (2) to provide for pricing and funding adjustments upon
the substitution of collateral for the Fixed Income Investments encumbered by
the Security Agreement.





Agreement:





Now,
therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree that the Note shall be
modified as follows:





1.                                       Subsection (a)
of the “Borrowing and Repayment” section of the Note shall be amended to read
as follows:





(a)                                  Borrowing
and Repayment:  Borrower may from
time to time during the term of this Note borrower, partially or wholly repay
its outstanding borrowings, and reborrow, subject to all of the limitations,
terms and conditions of this Note and of any document executed in connection
with



























or governing
this Note; provided however, that the total outstanding borrowings under this
Note shall not at any time exceed the principal amount stated above.  The unpaid principal balance of this
obligation at any time shall be the total amounts advanced hereunder by the
holder hereof less the amount of principal payments made hereon by or for any
Borrower, which balance may be endorsed hereon from time to time by the
holder.  The outstanding principal
balance of this Note shall be due and payable in full on January 1, 2008.





2.                                       Borrower hereby
agrees to replace the Fixed Income Investments upon their respective maturities
with replacement collateral that satisfies all required qualifications and
valuations set forth in the Security Agreement.
Upon a determination by Lender that such replacement and substitution
has been completed and that the interest of Lender therein has attached and has
been perfected, Lender hereby agrees to modify the Note to provide that
interest under both the Fixed Rate Term LIBOR option and the Daily LIBOR rate
option shall accrue at an increment equal to one-half of one percent (0.50%)
above the applicable LIBOR determination.





3.                                       Upon completion
of the collateral substitution set forth in paragraph 2 above, the definition
of “Collateral Value” in the Addendum to Security Agreement: Securities
Account, which is included in the definition of
“Security Agreement” and which governs the amounts that may be disbursed
under the Agreement and the Note, shall be amended to read as follows:





“Collateral
Value” means the percentage set forth below of the lower of the face or
market value, or the lower of the face or redemption value, as appropriate, for
each type of investment property held in the Securities Account at the time of
computation, with such value and the classification of any particular
investment property in all instances determined by Bank in its sole discretion,
and excluding from such computation (a) all WF Securities and Collective
Investment Funds, (b) any stock with a market value of $10.00 or less, and (c)
all investment property from an issuer if Bank determines such issuer to be
ineligible.

4.                                       In consideration

hereof, Borrower shall pay herewith a non-refundable fee equal to $37,500, (one
eight of one percent of the LOC commitment amount of $30,000,000).

5.                                       Except as
expressly set forth herein, all terms and conditions of the Loan Documents

this Modification.  This Modification and
the Loan Documents shall be read together as one document.





6.                                       Borrower
certifies that as of the date of this Modification (a) there exists no Event of
Default under the Loan Documents, nor any condition, act or event which with
the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would constitute any such
Event of Default, and (b) Borrower has no defense offset or counterclaim with
respect to Borrower’s obligations under the Loan Documents.





7.                                       All security

WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Modification to be executed as of
the day and year first written above.

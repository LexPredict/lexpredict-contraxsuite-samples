parties; and provided further that no such participation shall affect the
rights and duties of the Lender vis-a-vis the Borrower.  The Borrower shall not

assignee, but the Lender may provide any such Person with any information
furnished by the Borrower to the Lender in compliance with subsection 9.11.

summons may be served by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail, or a form of
mail substantially equivalent thereto, addressed to it at its address set forth

AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AS
TO ANY ISSUE RELATING HERETO IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING

the Lender is requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or regulatory authority to disclose any such information, the
Lender will provide the Borrower with prompt notice of such request or
requirement in order to enable the Borrower to seek an appropriate protective
order or other remedy, or to consult with the Lender with respect to the
Borrower's taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal
process.  If, in such event, the Borrower has not provided the Lender with a
protective order or other remedy in sufficient time, with the Lender acting in
good faith and otherwise in its sole discretion, for the Lender to avoid
unlawful nondisclosure of such information, the Lender may disclose such
information pursuant to such law, regulation, or in such legal process, or to
such regulatory authority, as the case may be, without any recourse or remedy
against the Lender by the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower, which the
Borrower hereby expressly waives.

9.12      FCC Compliance.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein or in any other agreement, instrument or document
executed in connection herewith, no party hereto shall take any actions

license, permit or authorization issued by the Federal Communications Commission
(the "FCC") or a change of control over any such license, permit or
authorization requiring the prior approval of the FCC without first obtaining
such prior approval of the FCC.

stock of the Borrower; and

WHEREAS, the Borrower and the Lender have entered into a Credit
Agreement dated as of the date hereof (as amended, modified and supplemented
from time to time, the "Credit Agreement") pursuant to which the Lender has
agreed to make Loans to the Borrower; and

WHEREAS, in order to secure the Obligations of the Borrower under
the Credit Agreement and the Note and the obligations of the Pledgor under the

security interest in and lien on all of its right, title and interest in, to

payment and performance in full of the Obligations of the Borrower under the

SECTION 3.          Delivery of Certificates.  Simultaneously
with the execution and delivery hereof, the Pledgor is delivering to the Lender
all instruments and certificates representing the Pledged Securities, together
with appropriate undated instruments of transfer or assignment duly executed in
blank.  In addition, the Pledgor shall promptly deliver to the Lender, or cause

certificates, instruments or other property, including any cash dividends or
distributions representing or constituting any Collateral received or
receivable by the Pledgor after the date of this Pledge Agreement, other than

or assignment duly executed in blank by the Pledgor.  Any such certificates,
instruments or other property representing or constituting any Collateral
received by the Pledgor after the date of this Pledge Agreement shall be held
by the Pledgor in trust for the Lender and shall forthwith be delivered by the
Pledgor to the Lender as aforesaid.  If at any time the Lender notifies the
Pledgor that additional endorsements or other instruments of transfer or
assignment with respect to any of the Collateral held by the Lender are
required, the Pledgor shall promptly execute the same in blank and deliver such
endorsements or other instruments of transfer or assignment as the Lender may
request.

SECTION 4.          Dividends and Distributions.  The Pledgor
shall deliver to the Lender, as Collateral, any and all additional shares of

subscription rights, liquidation (in whole or in part), conversion, prepayment
or redemption (in whole or in part) or otherwise.

SECTION 5.          Power of Attorney.  The Pledgor hereby
constitutes and irrevocably appoints the Lender, with full power of
substitution and revocation by the Lender, as the Pledgor's true and lawful
attorney-in-fact, for the purpose from time to time upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default of carrying out the provisions of
this Pledge Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that
the Lender deems necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this
Pledge Agreement, including, without limitation, to affix to certificates and
documents representing any Collateral the endorsements or other instruments of
transfer or assignment delivered with respect thereto and to transfer or cause
the transfer of the Collateral, or any part thereof, on the books of the
Borrower.  The power of attorney granted pursuant to this Pledge Agreement and
all authority hereby conferred are granted and conferred solely to protect the
Lender's interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the
Lender to exercise any power.  This power of attorney shall be irrevocable as
one coupled with an interest.

SECTION 6.          Representations of Pledgor.  The Pledgor
represents and warrants to the Lender that:

by or in respect of, any arbitrator or Governmental Authority and no
consent of any other Person is required (i) for the execution, delivery
and performance of this Pledge Agreement by the Pledgor, (ii) for the
pledge by the Pledgor of the Collateral to the Lender pursuant to this
Pledge Agreement, or (iii) subject to Section 17 hereof, for the
exercise by the Lender of the rights provided for in this Pledge
Agreement or the remedies in respect of the Collateral pursuant to this
Pledge Agreement, except as may be required under federal or state
securities laws in connection with any sale of the





<PAGE>   33

Collateral;

(b)   The Pledgor is the sole legal and beneficial owner of, and
has valid and transferrable title to, the Collateral, free and clear of
all Liens, other than the Lien in favor of the Lender created by this
Pledge Agreement;

(c)   There are no outstanding options, warrants or other
agreements with respect to the Collateral;

(d)   The Shares represent 100% of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Borrower;

(e)   The Pledged Securities have been duly authorized and
validly issued, are fully paid and non- assessable, and, subject to
Section 17 hereof, are not subject to any charter, bylaw, statutory,
contractual or other restrictions governing their issuance, transfer,
ownership or control; and

(f)   All actions (including, without limitation, delivery to the
Lender of all certificates representing the Pledged Securities together
with undated stock powers or other instruments of assignment duly
executed in blank, registration of the Lien created hereby on the
Collateral on the books and records of the issuer of any Pledged
Securities and, if required, the filing of UCC-1 financing statements in
all appropriate jurisdictions) required to create and perfect the Lien
of the Lender in the Collateral have been taken and the Lien on the
Collateral in favor of the Lender is superior in right to any rights or
claims of any other Person.

SECTION 7.          Obligations of Pledgor.  The Pledgor further

in, or suffer or permit any Lien to exist on or with respect to, any of
the Collateral except the Lien created under this Pledge Agreement;

(b)   The Pledgor will, at its own expense, at any time and from
time to time at the request of the Lender, do, make, procure, execute

as may be reasonably requested by the Lender to further preserve,
establish, perfect or enforce the Lender's rights, interests and
remedies created by, provided in or emanating from this Pledge
Agreement;

(c)   The Pledgor will defend the Lender's right, title and
interest in, to and under the Collateral against the claims and demands
of all Persons whomsoever (other than Persons claiming by or through the
Lender);

(d)   The Pledgor hereby authorizes the Lender to file one or
more financing or continuation statements and amendments thereto
relating to all or any part of the Collateral without the Pledgor's
signature.  A photocopy or other reproduction of this Pledge Agreement
shall be sufficient as a financing statement;

(e)   The Pledgor will not permit the Borrower to issue any
additional securities or capital



<PAGE>   34


stock; and

(f)   The Pledgor will cause the Borrower to execute and deliver
to the Lender on the date hereof a letter substantially in the form of
Exhibit A hereto.

SECTION 8.          Rights of Pledgor.  So long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Pledgor shall be entitled to vote
or consent with respect to the Collateral in any manner not inconsistent with
this Pledge Agreement, the Credit Agreement or any other Related Document.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Lender shall have the exclusive right to vote the Pledged Securities.  The
Pledgor hereby grants to the Lender an irrevocable proxy to vote the
Collateral, which proxy shall be effective immediately upon the occurrence of
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and upon the request of the
Lender, the Pledgor agrees to deliver to the Lender such further evidence of
such irrevocable proxy or such further irrevocable proxy to vote the Collateral
as the Lender may request.

SECTION 9.          Rights of the Lender.

(a)   If the Pledgor fails to perform any agreement contained
herein, the Lender may (but shall not be obligated or required to)
perform, or cause the performance, of such agreement.

(b)   At any time upon and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Lender may (but shall not be obligated or required to):

(i)   Subject to Section 17 hereof, cause the Collateral to
be transferred to its name or to the name of its nominee or
nominees and thereafter exercise as to such Collateral all of the
rights, powers and remedies of an owner;

(ii)    Ask for, demand, collect, sue for, recover,
compromise, receive and give acquittances and receipts for monies
due or to become due under or in respect of any of the Collateral
and hold the same as part of the Collateral, or apply the same to
any of the Obligations in such manner as the Lender may direct in
its sole discretion;

(iii)   Receive, endorse and collect any drafts or other
instruments, documents and chattel paper, in connection with
clause (ii) above (including, without limitation, all instruments
representing dividends, interest payments or other distributions
in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof and give full
discharge for the same);

(iv)    Subject to Section 17 hereof, file any claims or
take any actions or institute any proceedings that the Lender may
deem necessary or desirable for the collection of any of the
Collateral or otherwise to enforce compliance with the rights of
the Lender with respect to any of the Collateral;

(v)     Enter into any extension, subordination,
reorganization, deposit, merger, or consolidation agreement, or
any other agreement relating to or affecting the Collateral, and
in connection therewith deposit or surrender control of such
Collateral thereunder, and accept other property in exchange
therefor and hold and apply such property or money so received in
accordance with the provisions hereof; and




<PAGE>   35

(vi)    Discharge any taxes levied on the Collateral or pay
for the maintenance and preservation of the Collateral; the
amount of such payments, plus any and all fees, costs and
expenses of the Lender (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) actually in connection therewith, shall, at the
Lender's option, be reimbursed by the Pledgor on demand.

SECTION 10.   Release of Collateral.  In the event that the
entire outstanding principal sum of and accrued interest on the Loans is paid
in full and all other non-contingent Obligations are paid and performed in
full, the Lender shall deliver the Collateral to the Pledgor, thereby releasing
the security interest granted hereunder and this Pledge Agreement shall
terminate.

SECTION 11.   Event of Default; Remedies.  Upon and during the
continuance of an Event of Default:

(a)   The Lender shall have all the rights and remedies of a
secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any
applicable jurisdiction.  In addition, the Lender shall have the right,
without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement or notice
of any kind, except as specified below, to or upon the Pledgor or any
other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements and/or
notices are hereby expressly waived), to proceed forthwith to collect,
receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part
thereof and to proceed forthwith to sell, assign, give an option or
options to purchase, contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of and
deliver the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at
public or private sale or sales at such prices and on such terms and
restrictions (including, without limitation, a requirement that any
purchaser of all or any part of the Collateral shall be required to
purchase any securities constituting the Collateral solely for
investment and without any intention to make a distribution thereof) as
the Lender may deem appropriate without any liability for any loss due
to decrease in the market value of the Collateral during the period
held.  If any notification to the Pledgor of the intended disposition of
the Collateral is required by law, such notification shall be deemed
reasonable and properly given if hand delivered or made by telecopy at
least ten Business Days' prior to such disposition to the address of the
Pledgor indicated below.

(b)   All of the Lender's rights and remedies under this Pledge
Agreement and under applicable law, including but not limited to the
foregoing, shall be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be
enforceable alternatively, successively or concurrently as the Lender
may deem expedient.

(c)   Upon any sale or other disposition, the Lender shall have
the right to deliver, endorse, assign and transfer to the purchaser
thereof the Collateral so sold or disposed of.  Each purchaser at any
such sale or other disposition, including the Lender, shall hold the
Collateral free from any claim or right of whatever kind, including any
equity or right of redemption.  The Pledgor specifically waives all
rights of stay or appraisal which the Pledgor had or may have under any
rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter adopted.

(d)   The Lender undertakes to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause a sale of the Collateral; provided, that the Lender
shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition unless the
terms thereof shall be satisfactory to it.  The Pledgor acknowledges and
agrees that the





<PAGE>   36

Lender shall have no liabilities for any delay experienced in its efforts
to effect such a sale or the ultimate terms of any such sale.  The Lender
may, without notice or publication, adjourn any private or public
sale, and, upon ten Business Days' prior notice to the Pledgor, hold such
sale at any time or place to which the same may be so adjourned.  In case
of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral, on credit or future
delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Lender until the
selling price is paid by the purchaser thereof, but the Lender shall
incur no liability in case of the failure of such purchaser to take up
and pay for the property so sold and, in case of any such failure, such
property may again be sold as herein provided.

SECTION 12.   Disposition of Proceeds.  The proceeds of any sale
or disposition of all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied (after
payment of any amounts payable to the Lender pursuant to Section 14 hereof) by
the Lender to the payment of the Obligations in such order as the Lender may
elect.  Any surplus thereafter remaining shall be paid to the Pledgor, subject
to the rights of any holder of a Lien on the Collateral of which the Lender has
actual notice.  If the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral are
insufficient to satisfy the Obligations, the Pledgor shall remain liable for
any deficiency.

SECTION 13.   Termination.  This Pledge Agreement shall: (a)
create a continuing security interest in the Collateral; (b) remain in full
force and effect for so long as any Obligations under any of the Related
Documents are outstanding; (c) be binding upon the Pledgor and its permitted
successors and assigns; and (d) inure to the benefit of the Lender and its
successors, transferees and assigns.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Lender
may assign or otherwise transfer the Loan, or any portion thereof, held by it to
any other Person in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, and such
other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect
thereof granted herein or otherwise.  The Pledgor may not assign its rights or
obligations under this Pledge Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Lender.

SECTION 14.   Expenses of the Lender.  All expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) actually
incurred by the Lender in connection with the failure by the Pledgor to perform
or observe any provision of this Pledge Agreement, the exercise or enforcement
of any rights of the Lender under this Pledge Agreement and the custody or
preservation of any of the Collateral and any actual or attempted sale or
exchange of, or any enforcement, collection, compromise or settlement
respecting, the Collateral, or any other action taken by the Lender hereunder
whether directly or as attorney-in-fact pursuant to a power of attorney or
other authorization herein conferred, shall be deemed an Obligation secured by
the Collateral and the Lender may apply the Collateral to payment of or
reimbursement of itself for such liability.

SECTION 15.   Lender's Duty.  Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in Section 11(d) hereof, the Lender shall not be required to take any
action hereunder in respect of an Event of Default.  The Lender shall not be
liable for any acts, omissions, errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law
including, without limitation, acts, omissions, errors or mistakes with respect
to the Collateral, except for those arising out of or in connection with the
Lender's (i) gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (ii) failure to use
reasonable care with respect to the safe custody of any certificate or
instrument evidencing any part of the Collateral which is in the physical
possession of the Lender.  The Lender shall be under no obligation to take any
steps necessary to preserve rights in the Collateral against any prior parties
but may do so at its option, and all expenses incurred in connection therewith
shall be for the account of the Pledgor, and shall be added to the Obligations
secured hereby.



<PAGE>   37
SECTION 16.   General Provisions.

(a)   No failure on the part of the Lender to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the
Lender of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or
future exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy.  The representations, covenants and agreements of the Pledgor
herein contained shall survive the date hereof.

(b)   This Pledge Agreement is a Related Document to which
reference is made in, and which is executed pursuant to, the Credit
Agreement and shall (unless otherwise expressly indicated herein) be
construed, administered and applied in accordance with the terms and
provisions thereof.

(c)   No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Pledge
Agreement nor consent to any departure by the Pledgor herefrom nor
release of all or any part of the Collateral shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing, signed by the Lender.
Any such waiver or consent or release shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given.

(d)   Except as expressly otherwise provided herein, all notices,
requests and demands to or upon the respective parties hereto to be
effective shall be in writing (including by telecopy or telex), and
shall be delivered and deemed effective in the manner set forth in the
Credit Agreement, except that the address for all notices to Pledgor
shall be the address set forth below the signature of the Pledgor.

(e)   THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND INTERPRETED
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
EACH OF THE LENDER AND THE PLEDGOR HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT.

(f)   The Pledgor hereby consents to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York for New York
County and the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York with respect to any suit, claim, action or proceeding arising
out of or related to this Pledge Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and hereby waives any objection which it may have
now or hereafter to the venue of any suit, claim, action or proceeding
arising out of or related to this Pledge Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and brought in the courts specified above and also
hereby waives any claim that any such suit, claim, action or proceeding
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  The Pledgor agrees that
service of process or other legal summons for purposes of any action or
proceeding under this Pledge Agreement or the other Related Documents
may be served on Pledgor by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail,
or a form of mail substantially equivalent thereto, addressed to it at
its address set forth in or designated pursuant to Section 16(d), such
service to become effective 10 days after such mailing and agrees that
nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in
any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any
other jurisdiction.
<PAGE>   38

(g)   If any provision of this Pledge Agreement is determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be automatically reformed and construed so as to be valid,
operative and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law
while most nearly preserving its original intent.  The invalidity of any
part of this Pledge Agreement shall not render invalid the remainder of
the Pledge Agreement.

(h)   This Pledge Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each
of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument.

(i)   The section headings in this Pledge Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation
hereof.

SECTION 17.  FCC Compliance.

(a)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
or in any other agreement, instrument, or document executed in
connection herewith, no party hereto shall take any actions hereunder
that would constitute or result in a transfer or assignment of any
Station License (as defined in the HAT Exchange Agreement), permit or
authorization, or a change of control over such Station License, permit
or authorization requiring the prior approval of the FCC without first
obtaining such prior approval of the FCC.  In addition, the parties
acknowledge that the voting rights of the Pledged Securities shall
remain with the Pledgor even upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default until the FCC shall have given its
prior consent to the exercise of stockholder rights by a purchaser at a
public or private sale of such Pledged Securities or the exercise of
such rights by the Lender or by a receiver, trustee, conservator or
other agent duly appointed pursuant to applicable law.

(b)   If an Event of Default shall have occurred, Pledgor shall
take any action which the Lender may request in the exercise of its
rights and remedies under this Pledge Agreement in order to transfer or
assign the Collateral to the Lender or to such one or more third parties
as the Lender may designate, or to a combination of the foregoing.  To
enforce the provisions of this Section 17, the Lender is empowered to
seek from the FCC and any other Governmental Authority, to the extent
required, consent to or approval of any involuntary transfer of control
of any entity whose Collateral is subject to this Pledge Agreement for
the purpose of seeking a bona fide purchaser to whom control ultimately
will be transferred.  Pledgor agrees to cooperate with any such
purchaser and with the Lender in the preparation, execution and filing
of any forms and providing any information that may be necessary or
helpful in obtaining the FCC's consent to the assignment to such
purchase of the Collateral.  Pledgor hereby agrees to consent to any
such voluntary or involuntary transfer after and during the continuation
of an Event of Default and, without limiting any rights of the Lender
under this Pledge Agreement, to authorize the Lender to nominate a
trustee or receiver to assume control of the Collateral, subject only to
required judicial, FCC or other consents required by Governmental
Authorities, in order to effectuate the transactions contemplated by
this Section 17.  Such trustee or receiver shall have all the rights and
powers as provided to it by law or court order, or to the Lender under
this Pledge Agreement.  Pledgor shall cooperate fully in obtaining the
consent of the FCC and the approval or consent of each other
Governmental Authority required to effectuate the foregoing.
<PAGE>   39

(c)   In connection with this Section 17, the Lender shall be
entitled to rely in good faith upon an opinion of outside FCC counsel of
the Lender's choice with respect to any such assignment or transfer,
whether or not the advice rendered is ultimately determined to have been
accurate.

GUARANTY


GUARANTY (the "Guaranty") made as of ______________, 1998 by
STC BROADCASTING OF VERMONT, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), in
favor of HEARST-ARGYLE STATIONS, INC. (the "Lender").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, STC BROADCASTING OF VERMONT SUBSIDIARY, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Borrower") has entered into a Credit Agreement dated
as of the date hereof (as amended, modified and supplemented from time to time,
the "Credit Agreement") with the Lender pursuant to which the Lender has agreed
to make Loans to the Borrower;

WHEREAS, the Guarantor is the sole shareholder of the
Borrower;

WHEREAS, the Lender has required the Guarantor to guarantee
the Obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Guarantor is willing to guarantee the Obligations
of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the Related Documents to which
the Borrower is a party on the terms set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the Guarantor acknowledges it is receiving direct
benefits from the consummation of the Credit Agreement; and

WHEREAS, to secure the payment and performance of the
Obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and the Note and its
obligations under this Guaranty and the Pledge Agreement, the Guarantor has
executed and delivered to the Lender a Pledge Agreement (as amended, modified
and supplemented from time to time, the "Pledge Agreement") dated as of the
date hereof pursuant to which the Guarantor has granted to the Lender a
security interest in and lien upon all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Borrower.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

SECTION 1.       DEFINITIONS

1.1      Defined Terms.  Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings provided to such terms in the
Credit Agreement.




<PAGE>   45

SECTION 2.       GUARANTY

2.1      Guaranty of Obligations.  The Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees (as primary obligor and not merely
as surety) to the Lender the full payment and performance by the Borrower, when
due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), of all the
Obligations.  The Guarantor hereby agrees that it will forthwith pay and
perform the Obligations immediately upon demand by the Lender as such
Obligations become due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.

2.2      Guaranty Absolute.  This Guaranty is an unconditional
and absolute guaranty of payment (and not merely of collection) and shall apply
to all of the Obligations without limitation as to either amount or period of
time.  The Obligations shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in
reliance upon this Guaranty.  This Guaranty shall be enforceable against the
Guarantor, its successors and assigns, without the necessity of making any
demand of the Borrower or taking any action or resorting to any suit or
proceeding against the Borrower or any other party or exhausting any other
security or collateral.  The Guarantor guarantees that all the Obligations will
be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and the
Related Documents to which the Borrower is a party, regardless of any law,
regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting
any of such terms or the rights of the Lender with respect thereto and
notwithstanding any claim, defense or right of set-off the Borrower, the
Guarantor or any other Person may have against the Lender.

2.3      Waivers.  The Guarantor waives (i) the right to have
the Lender pursue any other remedy or enforce any other rights, (ii) the right
to receive notice of acceptance of this Guaranty or notice of the incurrence,
existence or non-payment of any of the Obligations and (iii) presentment,
demand, notice of dishonor, protest or any other notice or demand to which the
Guarantor might otherwise be entitled.  The Guarantor shall not be exonerated
or discharged from liability hereunder by any time or grace period given to the
Borrower or by any other indulgence or concession granted to the Borrower,
including, without limitation, any such period, indulgence or concession
whatsoever affecting or preventing a recovery of the Obligations which, but for
this provision, might operate to exonerate or discharge the Guarantor from its
obligations hereunder.

2.4      Guaranty Not Affected by Changes.  This Guaranty
shall be a continuing guaranty, and the obligations and liability of the
Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected, impaired, released, reduced or
discharged by reason of the occurrence of any of the following, all without
further notice to or consent of the Guarantor:

(a)      the amendment, modification or supplement (whether
material or otherwise) of any of the Obligations, the Credit Agreement
or any of the Related Documents;

(b)      the assertion of any of the rights or remedies of the
Lender under the Credit Agreement or any of the Related Documents;

(c)      the failure, omission or delay on the part of the
Lender to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy
conferred on or available to the Lender under the Credit Agreement or
any of the Related Documents;



<PAGE>   46

(d)      any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, assignment for the benefit of creditors, receivership or
trusteeship affecting the Borrower;

(e)      any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the
Obligations, the Credit Agreement, any of the Related Documents or any
other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

(f)      any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to
or departure from any other guaranty or security for all or any of the
Obligations; or

(g)      any other circumstances which might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or
the Guarantor (other than a defense of payment or performance).

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated,
as the case may be, if at any time, any payment of any amounts payable by the
Borrower is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Lender upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.  If an event permitting the acceleration
of any of the Obligations of the Borrower shall at any time have occurred and
be continuing and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented by reason
of the pendency against the Borrower of a case or proceeding under any
bankruptcy or insolvency law, the Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this
Guaranty and its obligations hereunder, the Obligations of the Borrower shall
be deemed to have been accelerated and the Guarantor shall forthwith pay such
Obligations, and the other obligations hereunder, without any further notice or
demand (including interest which, but for the filing of a petition in
bankruptcy with respect to the Borrower, would accrue on the Obligations).

2.5      Payments.  Each payment to be made by the Guarantor
under this Guaranty or in connection herewith to any Person shall be made
without set-off or deduction of any kind whatsoever and also shall be made free
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any
tax, reserve, levy or duty of, or imposed by, any governmental or taxing
authority in any jurisdiction unless the Guarantor is required to make such a
payment subject to the deduction or withholding of such tax, in which case the
amount payable by the Guarantor in respect of which such deduction or
withholding is required to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary to
ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, such other
Person receives and retains (free from any liability in respect of any such
deduction or withholding) a net amount equal to the amount which it would have
received and so retained had no such deduction or withholding been made or
required to be made.  The provisions of this subsection 2.5 shall survive the
payment in full of the Obligations.

2.6      Subrogation.  Notwithstanding any payment or payments
made by the Guarantor hereunder, until the Obligations are paid and performed
in full, the Guarantor expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation,
reimbursement, contribution, exoneration and indemnity (contractual, statutory
or otherwise) arising from the existence or performance of this Guaranty and
the Guarantor irrevocably waives any right to enforce any remedy which the
Lender now has or may hereafter have against the Borrower, and waives any
benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security now or hereafter held
by the Lender.




<PAGE>   47

SECTION 3.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Guarantor represents and warrants to the Lender that:

3.1      Status.  The Guarantor (i) is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) has
the corporate power, authority and legal right to own or operate its properties
or to lease the properties it operates, to conduct the business in which it is
currently engaged and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the
Related Documents to which it is a party, (iii) is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its
ownership, lease or operation of properties or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, (iv) directly owns all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Borrower and (v) does not have any
Subsidiaries other than the Borrower.

3.2      Corporate Power; Authorization; Consent.  The
Guarantor has the corporate power, authority and legal right to make, deliver
and perform this Guaranty and has taken all necessary corporate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty and the
other Related Documents to which it is a party.  No consent of any other Person
(including, without limitation, stockholders and creditors of the Guarantor),
and no authorization of, notice to, or other act by or in respect of the
Guarantor by or with any Governmental Authority, foreign or domestic, is
required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or
enforceability of this Guaranty or any other Related Documents to which it is a
party.

3.3      Binding Effect.  This Guaranty and each of the other
Related Documents to which the Guarantor is a party has been duly executed and
delivered by the Guarantor and constitute its legal, valid, and binding
obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, or other similar laws affecting creditors, rights generally and
general principles of equity.

3.4      Non-contravention.  The execution, delivery and

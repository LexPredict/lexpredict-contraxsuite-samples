notice (a “Notice of Borrowing”) to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly advise each Lender of its receipt thereof) not later than 10:00 A.M. (Chicago time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of any proposed
borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Advances and on the date of any proposed borrowing of Base Rate Advances. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be sent by telecopier, confirmed immediately in writing, and shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit
B, specifying therein the requested (i) date of borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) Type of Advances to be borrowed, (iii) aggregate amount of such Advances, and (iv) in the case of a borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial
Interest Period therefor. Each Lender shall, before 12:00 noon (Chicago time) on the date of such borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section
8.02, in same day funds, such Lender’s ratable portion of the requested borrowing. After the Administrative Agent’s receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent’s aforesaid address.

(b) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. If a Notice of Borrowing requests Eurodollar Rate Advances,
the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the requested borrowing date the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including
any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the requested Advance to be made by such Lender.

(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the date of any requested borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the requested borrowing date in accordance with Section 2.02(a) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to Advances made in connection with such borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Lender’s Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it on any borrowing date shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Advance to be made by such other Lender.

(e) Each Borrowing of Base Rate Advances shall at all times
be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000; and each Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Advances shall at all

Borrowings of Eurodollar Rate Advances outstanding at any time.

Amount may not be increased.

(b) The
Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be reduced on each Bond Issuance Date by the principal amount of all debt securities issued by the Borrower on such date (rounded down, if necessary, to an integral multiple of $10,000,000).

(c) The Aggregate Commitment Amount shall be reduced to
$550,000,000 (i) on October 20, 2003 if the Borrower does not exercise its right of first refusal to purchase British Energy’s 50% ownership interest in AmerGen Energy Company, LLC prior to the close of business on such date or (ii) on any date

principal amount of the Outstanding Advances on the Commitment Termination Date.

Advance, a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for each applicable Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of each Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advance
(and, if any Interest Period for such Advance is six months, on the day that is three months after the first day of such Interest Period) or, if earlier, on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance is converted to a Base Rate Advance or paid in full.


SECTION 2.07 Additional Interest on Eurodollar
Advances. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, for any period during which such Lender is required under regulations of the FRB to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities,
additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender, from the date of such Advance until such Advance is paid in full or converted to a Base Rate Advance, at an interest rate per annum equal to the
remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period for such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such
Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Advance; provided that no Lender shall be entitled to demand such additional interest more than 90 days following the last day of the Interest Period
in respect of which such demand is made; provided, further, that the foregoing proviso shall in no way limit the right of any Lender to demand or receive such additional interest to the extent that such additional interest relates to
the retroactive application of the reserve requirements described above if such demand is made within 90 days after the implementation of such retroactive reserve requirements. Such additional interest shall be determined by the applicable Lender
and notified to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.


SECTION 2.08 Interest Rate Determination. (a) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of each
applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a) or (b).

(b) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Majority Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for
any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so
notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon

(i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor (unless prepaid or converted to a Base Rate Advance on or prior to such day), convert into a Base Rate Advance, and


(ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make,
continue or convert into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.


13








SECTION 2.09 Continuation and Conversion of Advances. (a) The Borrower may on any Business Day,
upon notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 A.M. (Chicago time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of any proposed continuation of or conversion into Eurodollar Rate Advances, and on the date of any proposed
conversion into Base Rate Advances, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08 and 2.12, continue Eurodollar Rate Advances for a new Interest Period or convert a Borrowing of Advances of one Type into Advances of the other Type;
provided that any continuation of Eurodollar Rate Advances or conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances, unless, in the
case of such a conversion, the Borrower shall also reimburse the Lenders pursuant to Section 8.04(b) on the date of such conversion. Each such notice of a continuation or conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i)
the date of such continuation or conversion, (ii) the Advances to be continued or converted, and (iii) in the case of continuation of or conversion into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for such Advances.


(b) If the Borrower shall fail to select the
Type of any Advance or the duration of any Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of “Interest Period” in Section 1.01 and Section 2.09(a),
the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into Base Rate Advances.

SECTION 2.10 Prepayments. (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the
Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior to any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Advances, or one Business Day’s notice prior to any prepayment of Base Rate Advances, in each case stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances made as part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount not less than $10,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $1,000,000 in the case of any prepayment of Eurodollar
Rate Advances and $5,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $1,000,000 in the case of any prepayment of Base Rate Advances, and (ii) in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
Lenders pursuant to Section 8.04(b) on the date of such prepayment.

(b) If, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitment Amount pursuant to Section 2.04(b) or (c), the Outstanding Advances exceed the Aggregate Commitment Amount, the Borrower shall
immediately prepay Advances in an amount equal to such excess.

SECTION 2.11 Increased Costs. (a) If on or after the date of this Agreement, any Lender determines that (i) the introduction of or any change (other than, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether
or not having the force of law) shall increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand
to the



14









Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts (without duplication of any amount payable pursuant
to Section 2.14) sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided that no Lender shall be entitled to demand such compensation more than 90 days following the last day of the Interest Period in respect of which
such demand is made; provided, further, that the foregoing proviso shall in no way limit the right of any Lender to demand or receive such compensation to the extent that such compensation relates to the retroactive application of any
law, regulation, guideline or request described in clause (i) or (ii) above if such demand is made within 90 days after the implementation of such retroactive law, interpretation, guideline or request. A certificate as to the amount of
such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by a Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(b) If any Lender determines that, after the date of this Agreement, compliance with any law or regulation
or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) regarding capital adequacy requirements affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender (including, in any event, any determination after the date of this Agreement by any such governmental authority or central bank that, for purposes of capital adequacy requirements, any Lender’s
Commitment to the Borrower does not constitute a commitment with an original maturity of less than one year) and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender’s Commitment or the Advances made by
such Lender, then upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender from time to time as specified by such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such controlling Person, as applicable, in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such
Lender’s Commitment or the Advances made by such Lender; provided that no Lender shall be entitled to demand such compensation more than one year following the payment to or for the account of such Lender of all other amounts payable
hereunder by the Borrower and under any Note of the Borrower held by such Lender and the termination of such Lender’s Commitment to the Borrower; provided, further, that the foregoing proviso shall in no way limit the right of any
Lender to demand or receive such compensation to the extent that such compensation relates to the retroactive application of any law, regulation, guideline or request described above if such demand is made within one year after the implementation of
such retroactive law, interpretation, guideline or request. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by the applicable Lender shall be conclusive and binding, for all purposes, absent manifest error.


(c) Any Lender claiming compensation pursuant
to this Section 2.11 shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for,
or reduce the amount of, any such compensation that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.


15








SECTION 2.12 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender
shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or
its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, (i) the obligation of such Lender to make, continue or convert Advances into Eurodollar
Rate Advances shall be suspended (subject to the following paragraph of this Section 2.12) until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and (ii) all
Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender then outstanding shall, on the last day of the then applicable Interest Period (or such earlier date as such Lender shall designate upon not less than five Business Days’ prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent), be automatically converted into Base Rate Advances.

If the obligation of any Lender to make, continue or convert into Eurodollar Rate Advances has been suspended pursuant to the preceding paragraph, then, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, (i) all Advances that would otherwise be made by such Lender as Eurodollar Rate Advances shall instead be made as Base Rate Advances and (ii) to the extent that
Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender have been converted into Base Rate Advances pursuant to the preceding paragraph or made instead as Base Rate Advances pursuant to the preceding clause (i), all payments and prepayments of principal that
would have otherwise been applied to such Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Lender shall be applied instead to such Base Rate Advances of such Lender.

SECTION 2.13 Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under any Note not later than 10:00 A.M. (Chicago
time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02 in same day funds without setoff, counterclaim or other deduction. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause
to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest, facility fees and utilization fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.02(b), 2.07, 2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(b)) to the
Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from the effective date specified in such
Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all
appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

(b) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent any payment owed to such Lender by the Borrower is not made when due
hereunder, to charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower’s accounts with such Lender any amount so due.


16








(c) All computations of interest based on the Prime Rate shall be made by the
Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent, and all computations
of interest pursuant to Section 2.07 shall be made by a Lender, on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.07, by a Lender) of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall
be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of any interest or fees, as the case may be;
provided that if such extension would cause payment of interest on a Eurodollar Rate Advance to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due by the Borrower to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that the
Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any amount payable by the Borrower hereunder that is not paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall (to the fullest extent permitted by law) bear interest from the date when due until paid in full at a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate plus 2%, payable upon demand.


SECTION 2.14 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the
Borrower hereunder or under any Note shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.13, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lender’s Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities, collectively, “Taxes”). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as



17









may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14),
such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, the Borrower severally agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies to the extent arising from the execution, delivery or registration of this Agreement or the Notes (all of the foregoing, “Other Taxes”).

(c) No Lender may claim or demand payment or reimbursement in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant
to this Section 2.14 if such Taxes or Other Taxes, as the case may be, were imposed solely as the result of a voluntary change in the location of the jurisdiction of such Lender’s Applicable Lending Office.

(d) The Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the
Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.14) paid by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. Such indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date
such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

(e) Prior to the date of an initial borrowing hereunder in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof, and on the date
of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter within 30 days from the date of request if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each Lender
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall provide the Administrative Agent and the Borrower with the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying that such Lender is exempt from
United States withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be made to such Lender hereunder and under any Note. If for any reason during the term of this Agreement, any Lender becomes unable to submit the forms referred to above or the
information or representations contained therein are no longer accurate in any material respect, such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing to that effect. Unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent have
received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder or under any Note are not subject to United States withholding tax, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall withhold taxes from such payments at the
applicable statutory rate in the case of payments to or for any Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States and no Lender may claim or demand payment or reimbursement for such withheld taxes pursuant to this
Section 2.14.

(f) Any Lender claiming
any additional amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory



18









restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
any such additional amount which may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.


(g) If the Borrower makes any additional payment to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 in respect of any Taxes or Other
Taxes, and such Lender determines that it has received (i) a refund of such Taxes or Other Taxes or (ii) a credit against or relief or remission for, or a reduction in the amount of, any tax or other governmental charge attributable solely to any
deduction or credit for any Taxes or Other Taxes with respect to which it has received payments under this Section 2.14, such Lender shall, to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of such refund, credit, relief,
remission or reduction, pay to the Borrower such amount as such Lender shall have determined to be attributable to the deduction or withholding of such Taxes or Other Taxes. If, within one year after the payment of any such amount to the Borrower,
such Lender determines that it was not entitled to such refund, credit, relief, remission or reduction to the full extent of any payment made pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.14(g), the Borrower shall upon notice and demand of
such Lender promptly repay the amount of such overpayment. Any determination made by a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14(g) shall in the absence of bad faith or manifest error be conclusive, and nothing in this Section 2.14(g) shall
be construed as requiring any Lender to conduct its business or to arrange or alter in any respect its tax or financial affairs (except as required by Section 2.14(f)) so that it is entitled to receive such a refund, credit or reduction or as
allowing any Person to inspect any records, including tax returns, of such Lender.

(h) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower or any Lender hereunder, the agreements and obligations of
the Borrower and the Lenders contained in this Section 2.14 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under the Notes; provided that no Lender shall be entitled to demand any payment from the Borrower under
this Section 2.14 more than one year following the payment to or for the account of such Lender of all other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder and under any Note issued by the Borrower to such Lender and the termination of such
Lender’s Commitment; provided, further, that the foregoing proviso shall in no way limit the right of any Lender to demand or receive any payment under this Section 2.14 to the extent that such payment relates to the
retroactive application of any Taxes or Other Taxes if such demand is made within one year after the implementation of such Taxes or Other Taxes.

SECTION 2.15 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.02(b), 2.07, 2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(b)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by
all Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them, provided
that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such
recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount



19









so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so
recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off)
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.16 Term-Out Option. On the Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower may, subject to the approval of all Lenders (which approval may be
withheld by any Lender in its sole discretion), elect to convert all Outstanding Advances to term loans maturing 364 days after the Commitment Termination Date (in which event the parties hereto shall enter into an amendment hereto to reflect the
fact that this is no longer a revolving facility and to make such other changes to the terms hereof as may be agreed by the parties hereto).

THE AGENTS

SECTION 7.01 Authorization and Action. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as administrative
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in
so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any
action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 7.02 Administrative
Agent’s Reliance, Etc. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement, except for
its or their respective own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) the Administrative Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and
accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender which is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 8.07; (ii) the Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel
(including counsel for the Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants
or experts; (iii) the Administrative Agent makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statement, warranty or representation (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this
Agreement; (iv) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the Borrower or to inspect the property
(including the books and records) of the Borrower; (v) the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any instrument
or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier,
telegram, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.03 Administrative Agent and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment, Advances and Note (if any), Bank One shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Bank One in its
individual capacity. Bank One and its affiliates may accept



29









deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any Subsidiary and any
Person who may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, all as if it were not the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

SECTION 7.04 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.05
Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to their respective Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of
any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that such expenses are reimbursable by the Borrower but for which the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed by the Borrower.


SECTION 7.06 Successor Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative
Agent’s giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders’ removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a
commercial bank described in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of “Eligible Assignee” and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $150,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was



30









Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, then no successor Administrative Agent shall be appointed under this Section 7.06 without the prior written consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

SECTION 7.07 Documentation Agent and Lead Arranger. No Person
designated on the cover page, a signature page or elsewhere in this Agreement as the “Documentation Agent” or “Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner” shall have any duties or responsibilities in such capacity.

(b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of this Agreement or any instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or
observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.


(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain
at its address referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment Amount of, and principal
amount of the Advances owing by the Borrower to, each Lender from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders



34









may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
Assignee, together with any Note subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii)
record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, in exchange for the surrendered Note issued by the Borrower, a new Note to the order of the applicable assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment Amount assumed by such assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance
and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment Amount of such assigning Lender after giving effect to such assignment. Each such new Note or
Notes shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A.

(e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (each, a “Participant”) in or to all or a
portion of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any Note held by it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (v) such Lender shall retain the sole right to approve,
without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Note held by such Lender, other than any such amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Advance or Commitment in
which such Participant has an interest that forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Advance or Commitment, postpones any date fixed for any regularly scheduled payment of principal
of, or interest or fees on, any such Advance or Commitment, extends any Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Advance or releases any substantial portion of collateral, if any, securing any such Advance.

(f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant, or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on
behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Borrower received
by it from such Lender (subject to customary exceptions regarding regulatory requirements, compliance with legal process and other requirements of law).


35








(g) If (i) any Lender shall make demand for payment under Section 2.11(a),
2.11(b) or 2.14 or (ii) shall deliver any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.12 resulting in the suspension of certain obligations of such Lender with respect to Eurodollar Rate Advances, then (in the case
of clause (i)) within 60 days after such demand (if, but only if, such payment demanded under Section 2.11(a), 2.11(b) or 2.14 has been made by the Borrower), or (in the case of clause (ii)) within 60 days after
such notice (if such suspension is still in effect), as the case may be, the Borrower may demand that such Lender assign in accordance with this Section 8.07 to one or more Eligible Assignees designated by the Borrower and reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent all (but not less than all) of such Lender’s Commitment and the Advances owing to it within the next succeeding 30 days. If any such Eligible Assignee designated by the Borrower shall fail to consummate
such assignment on terms acceptable to such Lender, or if the Borrower shall fail to designate any such Eligible Assignee for all of such Lender’s Commitment and Advances, then such Lender may (but shall not be required to) assign such
Commitment and Advances to any other Eligible Assignee in accordance with this Section 8.07 during such period.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “Granting Bank”) may grant to a special
purpose funding vehicle (an “SPC”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Advance that such
Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Advance and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option
or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of an Advance by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to
the same extent, and as if, such Advance were made by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the
Granting Bank). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial
paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United
States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.07, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without
paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Advances to the Granting Bank or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Administrative Agent, neither of which consents shall be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Advances and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
Advances to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This Section 8.07(h) may not be amended in any manner which adversely affects a Granting Bank or an
SPC without the written consent of such Granting Bank or SPC.

If the differential is two levels or more, the intermediate rating at the midpoint will apply. If there is no midpoint, the higher of the two intermediate ratings will apply. If the Borrower has no Moody’s Rating or no S&P Rating, Level V
Status shall exist.

To each of the Agents and the Lenders which is a
party to the Credit
Agreement, dated as of
September 29, 2003, among Exelon Generation
Company, LLC, as Borrower, the various financial
institutions named therein, as Lenders and Bank
One, NA, as Administrative Agent


Re:	Credit Agreement


Ladies and Gentlemen:

This
opinion letter is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2003 (the “Agreement”), among Exelon Generation Company, LLC (the “Borrower”), as Borrower, the various financial
institutions named therein, as Lenders and Bank One, NA, as Administrative Agent. Unless otherwise specified, terms defined in the Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

We have acted as special counsel for the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the
Agreement. In that capacity, we have examined the following:

(i) The Agreement and the Notes;

(ii) The documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01 of the Agreement;
(iii) The Operating Agreement of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the “Operating Agreement”); and

(iv) A certificate of the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, dated September 23, 2003, attesting to the continued
subsistence of the Borrower in Pennsylvania on such dates (the “State Certificate”); and

(v) A certificate executed by the Secretary of the Borrower certifying that, among other things, the Borrower has not filed any
Certificate of Merger or Consolidation or a Certificate of Dissolution since September 23, 2003 (the “Secretary’s Certificate” and, together with the Operating Agreement and the State Certificate, the “Corporate Documents”).



D-1








We have also examined the originals, or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such other corporate or
organizational records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Borrower, and such other agreements, instruments and documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. We have
assumed the legal capacity and competence of natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to original documents of documents submitted to us as certified,
conformed or photostatic copies. We have assumed that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have duly executed and delivered, with all necessary power and authority (corporate and otherwise), the Agreement.

When an opinion or confirmation is given to our knowledge or with reference
to matters of which we are aware or which are known to us, or with another similar qualification, the relevant knowledge or awareness is limited to the actual knowledge or awareness of the lawyer in this firm who is the current primary contact for
the Borrower and the individual lawyers in this firm who have participated in the specific transaction to which this opinion letter relates and without any special or additional investigation undertaken for the purposes of this opinion letter,
except as otherwise noted herein. Based upon the foregoing and subject to the exceptions, limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the following opinion:

1. In reliance on the Corporate Documents, the Borrower is a limited liability company duly formed and validly subsisting
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

2. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Agreement and the Notes (a) are within the Borrower’s limited liability company powers, (b) have been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability company action of the Borrower,
(c) do not contravene (i) the Operating Agreement, of the Borrower, (ii) any law of the United States or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or (iii) to our knowledge, any agreement or instrument to which the Borrower is a party or by which the
Borrower is bound and (d) to our knowledge, do not result in or require the creation of any lien, security interest or other charge or encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the Borrower’s properties under such agreements or instruments.


3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no
notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body of the United States or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Agreement or the Notes, except for
the authorization of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which authorization has been received and is in full force and effect.

4. The Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered by the
Borrower, and the Agreement and the Notes are the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

5. The Borrower is not an “investment company” or a company “controlled” by an “investment
company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

We confirm to you that, to our knowledge, after inquiry of each lawyer in this firm who is the current
primary contact for the Borrower or who has devoted substantive attention to matters on behalf of the Borrower during the preceding twelve months and who is still currently employed by or a member of this firm, except as disclosed in Exelon
Corporation’s (“Exelon”) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 or Exelon’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, no litigation or governmental proceeding is pending or
threatened in writing against the Borrower (i) with respect to the Agreement or the Notes, or (ii) which is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

We draw to your attention the existence of the following two Pennsylvania statutes in connection with the fact that the Advances bear floating rates of
interest:

(i) Section 911 of the Pennsylvania “Crime
Code,” 18 Pa. C.S.A. §911, enacted by the Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482. Section 911 of the Crime Code bears a close resemblance to certain of the provisions of the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970,
18 U.S.C. §§1961-1968, commonly known as RICO, and is referred to hereinafter as the “Pennsylvania RICO Act.” The Pennsylvania RICO Act provides, among other things, that it is a criminal offense, punishable as a felony, to
“use or invest, directly or indirectly ... in the acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise” any income collected in full or partial satisfaction of a loan made “at a rate of interest
exceeding 25% per annum ... .”

(ii) The Act of December
29, 1982, P.L. 1671, 18 Pa. C.S.A. §4806.1 et seq. (superseded volume) (the “Criminal Usury Statute”). The Criminal Usury Statute provides, among other things, that it is a criminal offense, punishable as a felony, to engage
in, “charging, taking or receiving any money ... on the loan ... of any money ... at a rate exceeding thirty-six percent per annum... .”

(iii) The Criminal Usury Statute may have been repealed, but the manner in which the repeal was enacted leaves the matter subject to uncertainty.


Both the Pennsylvania RICO Act and the Criminal Usury Statute
appear to be intended by the legislature to apply only to racketeering and loan sharking type activities, and not to the type of commercial loan transaction evidenced by the Agreement. Nevertheless, in view of the plain language of the Pennsylvania
courts, we cannot say that the ultimate resolution of this issue is free from doubt.

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications:

(a) Our opinions are subject to the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or
similar laws affecting creditors’ rights and remedies generally, general principles of equity, including without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and limitations on



D-3









enforceability of rights to indemnification by federal or state securities laws or regulations or by public policy.

(b) We express no opinion as to the application or requirements of the
Pennsylvania Securities Act or federal or state securities, patent, trademark, copyright, antitrust and unfair competition, pension or employee benefit, labor, environmental health and safety or tax laws in respect of the transactions contemplated
by or referred to in the Agreement.

(c) We express no opinion
as to the validity or enforceability of any provision of the Agreement or the Notes which (i) permits the Lenders to increase the rate of interest in the event of delinquency or default if such increase would be deemed a penalty under applicable
law; (ii) purports to be a waiver by the Borrower of any right or benefit except to the extent permitted by applicable law; (iii) purports to require that waivers must be in writing to the extent that an oral agreement or implied agreement by trade
practice or course of conduct modifying provisions of the Agreement or the Notes has been made; (iv) purports to exculpate any party from its own negligent acts; or (v) purports to authorize any Participant to set off and apply any deposits at any
time held, and any other indebtedness at any time owing, by such Participant to or for the account of the Borrower.

We express no opinion as to the law of any jurisdiction other than the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal law of the United States.


The foregoing opinions are solely for your benefit in
connection with the consummation of the transaction described herein and may not be used or relied upon by you for any other purpose or by any other Person for any purpose without our express written consent (except that any Eligible Assignee that
may become a Lender under the Agreement after the date hereof may rely on this opinion letter as if it were an addressee hereof). The opinions given herein are as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update or supplement this opinion
letter to reflect facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in laws which may hereafter occur.

Very truly yours,

BALLARD SPAHR ANDREWS & INGERSOLL

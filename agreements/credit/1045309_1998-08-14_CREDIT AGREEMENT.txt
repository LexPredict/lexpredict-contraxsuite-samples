364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of May 14, 1998, among W.
R. GRACE & CO.-CONN., a Connecticut corporation (the "Company"), W. R. GRACE &
CO. (formerly named Grace Specialty Chemicals, Inc.), a Delaware corporation
(the "Parent"), the several banks from time to time parties to this Agreement
(the "Banks"), the co-agents signatories hereto (the "Co-Agents"), BANK OF
AMERICA NATIONAL TRUST AND SAVINGS ASSOCIATION, a [national banking
corporation], and NATIONSBANK, N.A., a national association, as
co-documentation agents (each, in such capacity, a "Co-Documentation Agent"),
THE CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, a New York banking corporation, as administrative
agent for the Banks hereunder (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent")
and CHASE SECURITIES INC., as arranger (in such capacity, the "Arranger").

The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:

"ABR Loans": Loans the rate of interest applicable to which
is based upon the Alternate Base Rate.

"Additional Bank": as defined in subsection 2.4(b).

"Affiliate": as to any Person, (a) any other Person (other
than a Subsidiary) which, directly or indirectly, is in control of, is
controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person or (b) any
Person who is a director, officer, shareholder or partner (i) of such
Person, (ii) of any Subsidiary of such Person or (iii) of any Person
described in the preceding clause (a). For purposes of this
definition, "control" of a Person means the power, directly or
indirectly, either to (i) vote 10% or more of the securities having
ordinary voting power for the election of directors of such Person or
(ii) direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of
such Person whether by contract or otherwise.

"Aggregate Outstanding Bilateral Option Loans": at any time,
(i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Dollar Bilateral
Loans and (ii) the aggregate Dollar Equivalents at such time with
respect to all outstanding Alternative Currency Bilateral Loans.

"Agreement": this 364-Day Credit Agreement, as the same may
be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.

"Alternate Base Rate": for any day, a rate per annum (rounded
upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the greater of
(a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day and (b) the Federal Funds
Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. "Prime Rate"
shall mean the rate of interest per annum publicly announced from time
to time by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate in effect at its
principal office in New York

<PAGE>


City. "Federal Funds Effective Rate" shall mean, for any day, the
weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions
with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by federal funds
brokers, as published on the next succeeding Business Day by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, if such rate is not so published
for any day which is a Business Day, the average of the quotations for
the day of such transactions received by the Administrative Agent from
three federal funds brokers of recognized standing selected by it. If
for any reason the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that it is
unable to ascertain the Federal Funds Effective Rate, for any reason,
including, the inability or failure of the Administrative Agent to
obtain sufficient quotations in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Alternate Base Rate shall be determined without regard to clause (b)
of the first sentence of this definition until the circumstances
giving rise to such inability no longer exist. Any change in the
Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the Federal
Funds Effective Rate shall be effective on the effective date of such
change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate,
respectively.

"Alternative Currency": any currency other than Dollars which
is freely transferable and convertible into Dollars.

"Alternative Currency Bilateral Loan": a Loan made by a Bank
to any Borrower in an Alternative Currency pursuant to Section 3.

"Applicable Margin": for any day on which the long term
senior unenhanced, unsecured debt of the Company is rated by both S&P
and Moody's, the rate per annum under the caption "Margin" (a "Margin
Rate") set forth below opposite the S&P and Moody's ratings applicable
to such debt on such day (or, if such ratings are set opposite two
different Margin Rates, then the Applicable Margin shall be the lower
of said two Margin Rates):

Margin             S&P                    Moody's

.450%              BB+ or lower           Ba1 or lower

.300%              BBB-                   Baa3

.240%              BBB                    Baa2

.210%              BBB+                   Baa1

.195%              A- or higher           A3 or higher

provided that if on any day the long term senior unenhanced, unsecured
debt of the Company is rated by only one of either S&P or Moody's, the
Applicable Margin will be determined based on the rating by such
rating agency, and provided, further, that if on any day the long term
senior unenhanced, unsecured debt of the Company is rated by neither
S&P nor Moody's, the Applicable Margin will be determined based on the
rating of such debt by Duff & Phelps, Fitch or another nationally
recognized statistical rating organization agreed to by and among the
Company, the Administrative Agent and the Majority Banks (each, a


<PAGE>
Page


"Substitute Rating Agency") and will be the Margin Rate set forth
above opposite the S&P and Moody's ratings comparable to such
Substitute Rating Agency's rating of such debt on such date, and
provided, further, that if on any day the long term senior unenhanced,
unsecured debt of the Company is rated by none of S&P, Moody's or any
Substitute Rating Agency, the Company, the Administrative Agent and
the Banks will negotiate in good faith to determine an alternative
basis for calculating the Applicable Margin consistent with the table
set forth above and, if agreement on such alternative basis is not
reached within 30 days, the Applicable Margin will be calculated on an
alternative basis determined by the Administrative Agent and the Banks
in their reasonable discretion consistent with the table above, and
until such alternative basis is determined the Applicable Margin will
be the Applicable Margin last determined as provided in the table
above.

Credit Loans") to any Borrower from time to time during the Commitment Period
in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the

Revolving Credit Loan if, after giving effect to such Loan, the aggregate Loan
Outstandings of all of the Banks plus the Aggregate Outstanding Bilateral
Option Loans would exceed the aggregate Commitments.

<PAGE>

Page

(b) The Revolving Credit Loans may from time to time be (i)
Eurodollar Loans, (ii) ABR Loans or (iii) a combination thereof, as determined
by the Borrower thereof and notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance
with subsections 2.3 and 5.5, provided that no Revolving Credit Loan shall be
made as a Eurodollar Loan maturing after the Termination Date.

2.2 Obligations of Borrowers; Revolving Credit Notes. (a)
Each Borrower agrees that each Revolving Credit Loan made by each Bank to such
Borrower pursuant hereto shall constitute the promise and obligation of such
Borrower to pay to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Bank, at the
office of the Administrative Agent specified in subsection 13.2, in lawful
money of the United States of America and in immediately available funds the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans made by such
Bank to such Borrower pursuant to subsection 2.1, which amounts shall be due
and payable (whether at maturity or by acceleration) as set forth in this
Agreement and, in any event, on the Termination Date.

(b) Each Borrower agrees that each Bank and the
Administrative Agent are authorized to record (i) the date, amount and Type of
each Revolving Credit Loan made by such Bank to such Borrower pursuant to
subsection 2.1, (ii) the date of each continuation thereof pursuant to
subsection 5.5(b), (iii) the date of each conversion of all or a portion
thereof to another Type pursuant to subsection 5.5(a), (iv) the date and amount
of each payment or prepayment of principal of each such Revolving Credit Loan
and (v) in the case of each such Revolving Credit Loan which is a Eurodollar
Loan, the length of each Interest Period and the Eurodollar Rate with respect
thereto, in the books and records of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as
the case may be, and in such manner as is reasonable and customary for such
Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and a certificate of an
officer of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, setting
forth in reasonable detail the information so recorded, shall constitute prima
facie evidence of the accuracy of the information so recorded; provided that
the failure to make any such recording shall not in any way affect the
obligations of such Borrower hereunder.

(c) Each Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the
Administrative Agent by any Bank at any time, the Revolving Credit Loans made
by such Bank to such Borrower shall be evidenced by a promissory note of such
Borrower, substantially in the form of Exhibit A with appropriate insertions as
to Borrower, payee, date and principal amount (a "Revolving Credit Note"),
payable to the order of such Bank and in a principal amount equal to the lesser
of (a) the amount of the initial Commitment of such Bank and (b) the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans made by such Bank to such
Borrower. Upon the request to the Administrative Agent by any such Bank at any
time, such Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Bank a Revolving Credit
Note conforming to the requirements hereof and executed by a duly authorized
officer of such Borrower. Each Bank is hereby authorized to record the date,
Type and amount of each Revolving Credit Loan made by such Bank to such
Borrower, each continuation thereof, each conversion of all or a portion
thereof to another Type, the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of
principal thereof and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the length of each
Interest Period and the Eurodollar Rate with respect thereto, on the schedule
annexed to and constituting a part of its Revolving Credit Note and any such

<PAGE>

Page

shall not in any way affect the obligations of such Borrower hereunder or
thereunder. Each Revolving Credit Note shall (x) be dated the Closing Date, (y)
be stated to mature on the Termination Date and (z) provide for the payment of
interest in accordance with subsection 5.1.

2.3 Procedure for Revolving Credit Borrowing. Any Borrower
may borrow under the Commitments from all Banks during the Commitment Period on
any Business Day, provided that such Borrower shall give the Administrative
Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative
Agent (a) prior to 4:00 P.M., New York City time, three Business Days prior to
the requested Borrowing Date, if all or any part of the requested Revolving
Credit Loans are to be initially Eurodollar Loans, or (b) prior to 10:00 A.M.,
New York City time, on the requested Borrowing Date, otherwise), specifying (i)
the amount to be borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date, (iii) whether the
borrowing is to be of Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans or a combination thereof and
(iv) if the borrowing is to be entirely or partly of Eurodollar Loans, the
respective amounts of each such Type of Loan and the respective lengths of the
initial Interest Periods therefor. Each borrowing under the Commitments shall
be in an amount equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof (or, in the case of ABR Loans, if the amount of the Available
Commitments minus the Aggregate Outstanding Bilateral Option Loans is less than
$5,000,000, such lesser amount). Upon receipt of such notice from such
Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof.
Each Bank will make the amount of its pro rata share of each such borrowing
available to the Borrower at the office of the Administrative Agent specified
in subsection 13.2 prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Borrowing
Date requested by such Borrower in funds immediately available to the
Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to such
Borrower on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts made
available to the Administrative Agent by the Banks and in like funds as
received by the Administrative Agent.

2.4 Extension of Termination Date. (a) The Company may
request, in a notice given as herein provided to the Administrative Agent and
each of the Banks not less than 45 days and not more than 60 days prior to the
Termination Date then in effect ("Existing Termination Date"), that the
Termination Date be extended, which notice shall specify a date (which shall be
the Existing Termination Date) as of which the requested extension is to be
effective (the "Effective Date"), and the new Termination Date to be in effect
following such extension (the "Requested Termination Date"), which date shall
be no more than 364 days after the effectiveness of such extension (with the
Effective Date being counted as the first day). Each Bank shall, not later than
a date 30 days prior to the Effective Date, notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent of its election to extend or not to extend the Termination
Date with respect to its Commitment. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any notice by any Bank of its willingness to extend
the Termination Date with respect to its Commitment shall be revocable by such
Bank in its sole and absolute discretion at any time more than 30 days prior to
the Effective Date. Any Bank which shall not timely notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent of its election to extend the Termination Date shall be
deemed to have elected not to extend the Termination Date with respect to its
Commitment.

(b) If any one or more Banks shall timely notify the Company
and the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection 2.4
of their election not to extend their Commitments or shall be deemed to have
elected not to extend their Commitments, (such Banks
<PAGE>

Page

being called "Terminating Banks"), then the Company may (i) designate from the
Banks other than Terminating Banks (the "Continuing Banks") one or more such
Continuing Banks to increase their Commitments, which Continuing Banks shall
have given notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent of their
willingness to so increase their Commitments, (ii) with notice to the
Administrative Agent, designate one or more other banking institutions willing
to extend Commitments until the Requested Termination Date (any such banking
institution, an "Additional Bank"), or (iii) any combination thereof, the
aggregate amount of the increases of such Continuing Banks' Commitments and the
amount of such Additional Banks' Commitments not to exceed the aggregate of the
Commitments of the Terminating Banks. Any such increase in the Commitment of a
Continuing Bank shall be evidenced by a written instrument executed by such
Continuing Bank, the Company and the Administrative Agent, and shall take
effect on the Existing Termination Date. Any Additional Bank shall, on the
Existing Termination Date, execute and deliver to the Company and the
Administrative Agent a "Commitment Transfer Supplement", satisfactory to the
Company and the Administrative Agent, setting forth the amount of such
Additional Bank's Commitment and containing its agreement to become, and to
perform all the obligations of, a Bank hereunder, and the Commitment of such
Additional Bank shall become effective on the Existing Termination Date.

(c) The Company and each other Borrower, if any, shall
deliver to each Continuing Bank and each Additional Bank which shall have
requested Revolving Credit Notes pursuant to subsection 2.2(c), on the Existing
Termination Date in exchange for each Revolving Credit Note, if any, of each of
the Borrowers held by such Bank, new Revolving Credit Notes, maturing on the
Requested Termination Date, in the principal amount of such Bank's Commitment
after giving effect to the adjustments made pursuant to this subsection 2.4.

(d) If some of or all the Banks shall have elected to extend
their Commitments as provided in this subsection 2.4, then (i) the Commitments
of the Continuing Banks and any Additional Banks shall continue until the
Requested Termination Date specified in the notice from the Company, and as to
such Banks the term "Termination Date", as used herein shall on and after the
Effective Date mean such Requested Termination Date; (ii) the Commitments of
the Terminating Banks shall continue until the Termination Date in effect prior
to such extension, and shall then terminate, and as to the Terminating Banks,
the term "Termination Date", as used herein, shall continue to mean such
Existing Termination Date; and (iii) from and after the Termination Date in
effect prior to such extension, the term "Banks" shall be deemed to include the
Additional Banks.

SECTION 3. BILATERAL OPTION LOANS

3.1 Requests for Offers. (a) From time to time during the
period from the Closing Date until the Termination Date, any Borrower may
request any or all of the Banks (each such Bank to which such a request is
made, a "Requested Bank") to make offers to make Bilateral Option Loans,
provided that immediately after making any such Bilateral Option Loan, the
aggregate Loan Outstandings of all the Banks plus the Aggregate Outstanding
Bilateral Option Loans will not exceed the aggregate Commitments. Any such
request shall specify the principal amount and maturity date of the Bilateral
Option Loans for which such Borrower is requesting offers, whether such
Bilateral Option Loans are requested to be Dollar Bilateral Loans or
Alternative Currency Bilateral Loans, the
<PAGE>

Page

time by which offers to make such Bilateral Option Loans must be made by such
Requested Bank and by which such offers shall be accepted or rejected by such
Borrower, and if all or any part of the requested Bilateral Option Loans are
requested to be made as Alternative Currency Bilateral Loans, the Alternative
Currency to be applicable thereto. Each Requested Bank may, but shall have no
obligation to, make such offers on such terms and conditions as are
satisfactory to such Requested Bank, and such Borrower may, but shall have no
obligation to, accept any such offers. No Bilateral Option Loan may mature
after the Termination Date.

(b) Each Borrower and Requested Bank shall separately agree
as to the procedures, documentation, lending office and other matters relating
to any Bilateral Option Loan.

3.2 Reports to Administrative Agent; Determination of Dollar
Equivalents. (a) The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a
report in respect of each Bilateral Option Loan (a "Bilateral Option Loan
Report") by 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date on which the applicable
Borrower accepts any Bilateral Option Loan, on the date on which any principal
amount thereof is repaid prior to the scheduled maturity date, or on the
scheduled maturity date if payment thereof is not made on such scheduled
maturity date, specifying for such Bilateral Option Loan the date on which such
Bilateral Option Loan was or will be made, such amount of principal is or will
be repaid or such payment was not made as the case may be; in the case of
Alternative Currency Bilateral Loans, the Alternative Currency thereof; and the
principal amount of such Bilateral Option Loan or principal prepayment or
repayment or the amount paid (in the case of any Alternative Currency Bilateral
Loan, expressed in the Alternative Currency therefor).

(b) Upon receipt of a Bilateral Option Loan Report with
respect to the acceptance of a Bilateral Option Loan, the Administrative Agent
shall determine the Dollar Equivalent thereof.

(c) If on any Borrowing Date on which after giving effect to
the Loans made on such date, the sum of the aggregate Loan Outstandings of all
the Banks plus the Aggregate Outstanding Bilateral Option Loans exceeds 85% of
the aggregate Commitments, then the Administrative Agent shall redetermine as
of such Borrowing Date, on the basis of the most recently delivered Bilateral
Option Loan Report for each Bilateral Option Loan, the Dollar Equivalent of
each Alternative Currency Bilateral Loan then outstanding. In addition, for so
long as the condition specified in the preceding sentence remains in effect,
the Administrative Agent shall determine, at the end of each fiscal quarter of
the Company, on the basis of the most recently delivered Bilateral Option Loan
Report for each Bilateral Option Loan, the Dollar Equivalent of each
Alternative Currency Bilateral Loan then outstanding.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Company of each Dollar Equivalent under this subsection 3.2.

3.3 Judgment Currency. If for the purpose of obtaining
judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower
hereunder or under any of the Notes in the currency expressed to be payable
herein or under the Notes (the "specified currency") into another currency, the
parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so,
that the rate
<PAGE>

Page


of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking
procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with
such other currency at the Administrative Agent's New York office on the
Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligations
of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Bank or the Administrative
Agent hereunder or under any Note shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a
currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent
that on the Business Day following receipt by such Bank or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other
currency such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in
accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the specified currency with
such other currency; if the amount of the specified currency so purchased is
less than the sum originally due to such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as
the case may be, in the specified currency, each Borrower agrees, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Bank or the Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, against such difference, and if the amount of the
specified currency so purchased exceeds:

(a) the sum originally due to any Bank or the Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, and

(b) any amounts shared with other Banks as a result of
allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Bank
under subsection 13.7,

such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such
excess to the applicable Borrower.

3.4 Repayments. Each Borrower shall repay to each Bank which
has made a Bilateral Option Loan on the maturity date of each Bilateral Option
Loan (such maturity date being that specified in the documentation referred to
in subsection 3.1(a)) the then unpaid principal amount of such Bilateral Option
Loan.

SECTION 4. BID LOANS

time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until

such that the aggregate Loan Outstandings of all the Banks at any time plus the
Aggregate Outstanding Bilateral Option Loans at such time will not exceed the
aggregate Commitments at such time, and provided, further, that no such Bid
Loan shall be made if, after giving effect thereto, any Bid Loans would mature
after the Termination Date.

4.2 Procedure for Bid Loans. (a) A Borrower shall request Bid
Loans by delivering a Bid Loan Request to the Administrative Agent, in writing,
by facsimile transmission, or by telephone, confirmed by facsimile
transmission, not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) one Business Day

for Bid Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and
<PAGE>

Page

for not more than three alternative maturity dates for such Bid Loans. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank by facsimile transmission
of the contents of each Bid Loan Request received by it.

(b) Upon receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent of
the contents of a Bid Loan Request, any Bank that elects, in its sole
discretion, to do so, shall irrevocably offer to make one or more Bid Loans at
a rate of interest determined by such Bank in its sole discretion for each such
Bid Loan. Any such irrevocable offer shall be made by delivering a Bid Loan
Offer to the Administrative Agent, by telephone, immediately confirmed by
facsimile transmission, before 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the proposed
Borrowing Date, setting forth the maximum amount of Bid Loans for each maturity
date, and the aggregate maximum amount for all maturity dates, which such Bank
would be willing to make (which amounts may, subject to subsection 4.1, exceed
such Bank's Commitments) and the rate of interest at which such Bank is willing
to make each such Bid Loan; the Administrative Agent shall advise the Borrower
before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the proposed Borrowing Date of the
contents of each such Bid Loan Offer received by it. If the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as a Bank shall, in its sole discretion, elect to make
any such offer, it shall advise the Borrower of the contents of its Bid Loan
Offer before 9:15 A.M. (New York City time) on the proposed Borrowing Date.

(c) The Borrower shall before 10:30 A.M. (New York City
time) on the proposed Borrowing Date, in its absolute discretion, either:

(i) cancel such Bid Loan Request by giving the
Administrative Agent telephone notice to that effect, and the
Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephone notice
thereof to the Banks and the Bid Loans requested thereby
shall not be made; or

(ii) accept one or more of the offers made by any Bank
or Banks by giving telephone notice to the Administrative
Agent (confirmed as soon as practicable thereafter by
delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Bid Loan
Confirmation in writing or by facsimile transmission) of the
amount of Bid Loans for each relevant maturity date to be
made by each Bank (which amount for each such maturity date
shall be equal to or less than the maximum amount for such
maturity date specified in the Bid Loan Offer of such Bid
Loan Bank, and for all maturity dates included in such Bid
Loan Offer shall be equal to or less than the aggregate
maximum amount specified in such Bid Loan Offer for all such
maturity dates) and reject any remaining offers made by
Banks; provided, however, that (x) the Borrower may not
accept offers for Bid Loans for any maturity date in an
aggregate principal amount in excess of the maximum principal
amount requested in the related Bid Loan Request, (y) if the
Borrower accepts any of such offers, it must accept offers
strictly based upon pricing for such relevant maturity date
and no other criteria whatsoever and (z) if two or more Banks
submit offers for any maturity date at identical pricing and
the Borrower accepts any of such
<PAGE>

Page

offers but does not wish to (or by reason of the limitations
set forth in subsection 4.1 or in clause (x) of this proviso,
cannot) borrow the total amount offered by such Banks with
such identical pricing, the Borrower shall accept offers from
all of such Banks in amounts allocated among them pro rata
according to the amounts offered by such Banks.

(d) If the Borrower accepts pursuant to clause (c) (ii) above
one or more of the offers made by any Bid Loan Bank or Bid Loan Banks, the
Administrative Agent shall notify before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) each
Bid Loan Bank which has made such an offer, of the aggregate amount of such Bid
Loans to be made on such Borrowing Date for each maturity date and of the
acceptance or rejection of any offers to make such Bid Loans made by such Bid
Loan Bank. Each Bid Loan Bank which is to make a Bid Loan shall, before 12:00
Noon (New York City time) on the Borrowing Date specified in the Bid Loan
Request applicable thereto, make available to the Administrative Agent at its
office set forth in subsection 13.2 the amount of Bid Loans to be made by such
Bid Loan Bank, in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent will
make such funds available to the Borrower at or before 2:00 P.M. (New York City
time) on such date at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address. As soon as
practicable after each Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Bank of the aggregate amount of Bid Loans advanced on such Borrowing Date
and the respective maturity dates thereof.

4.3 Repayments. Each Borrower shall repay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Bid Loan Bank which has made a Bid
Loan on the maturity date of each Bid Loan (such maturity date being that
specified by the Borrower for repayment of such Bid Loan in the related Bid
Loan Request) the then unpaid principal amount of such Bid Loan. The Borrowers
shall not have the right to prepay any principal amount of any Bid Loan without
the prior written consent of the Bid Loan Bank which made such Bid Loan.

4.4 Interest on Bid Loans. Each Borrower which shall have
borrowed a Bid Loan shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of such
Bid Loan from the Borrowing Date to the stated maturity date thereof, at the
rate of interest determined pursuant to subsection 4.2 above (calculated on the
basis of a 360 day year for actual days elapsed), payable on the interest
payment date or dates specified by such Borrower for such Bid Loan in the
related Bid Loan Request. If all or a portion of the principal amount of any
Bid Loan shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise), such overdue principal amount shall, without
limiting any rights of any Bank under this Agreement, bear interest from the
date on which such payment was due at a rate per annum which is 2% above the
rate which would otherwise be applicable to such Bid Loan until the scheduled
maturity date with respect thereto, and for each day thereafter at a rate per
annum which is 2% above the Alternate Base Rate until paid in full (as well
after as before judgment).

4.5 Obligations of Borrowers; Bid Loan Notes. (a) Each
Borrower agrees that each Bid Loan made by each Bid Loan Bank to such Borrower
pursuant hereto shall constitute the promise and obligation of such Borrower to
pay to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Bid Loan Bank, at the office
of the Administrative Agent specified in subsection 13.2, in lawful money of
the United

<PAGE>

Page

States of America and in immediately available funds the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of each Bid Loan made by such Bid Loan Bank to such Borrower
pursuant to subsection 4.2, which amounts shall be due and payable (whether at
maturity or by acceleration) as set forth in the Bid Loan Request related to
such Bid Loan and in this Agreement.

(b) Each Borrower agrees that each Bid Loan Bank and the
Administrative Agent are authorized to record (i) the date and amount of each
Bid Loan made by such Bid Loan Bank to such Borrower pursuant to subsection
4.2, and (ii) the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of
each such Bid Loan, in the books and records of such Bid Loan Bank or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and in such manner as is reasonable
and customary for such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be,
and a certificate of an officer of such Bid Loan Bank or the Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, setting forth in reasonable detail the information
so recorded, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the
information so recorded; provided that the failure to make any such recording
shall not in any way affect the obligations of such Borrower hereunder.

(c) Each Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the
Administrative Agent by any Bid Loan Bank at any time, the Bid Loans made by
such Bid Loan Bank to any Borrower shall be evidenced by a promissory note of
such Borrower, substantially in the form of Exhibit B with appropriate
insertions (a "Bid Loan Note"), payable to the order of such Bid Loan Bank and
representing the obligation of such Borrower to pay the unpaid principal amount
of all Bid Loans made by such Bid Loan Bank, with interest on the unpaid
principal amount from time to time outstanding of each Bid Loan evidenced
thereby as prescribed in subsection 4.4. Upon the request to the Administrative
Agent by any such Bid Loan Bank at any time, such Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Bid Loan Bank a Bid Loan Note conforming to the requirements
hereof and executed by a duly authorized officer of such Borrower. Each Bid
Loan Bank is hereby authorized to record the date and amount of each Bid Loan
made by such Bank, the maturity date thereof, the date and amount of each
payment of principal thereof and the interest rate with respect thereto on the
schedule annexed to and constituting part of its Bid Loan Note, and any such
recordation shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the
information so recorded; provided, however, that the failure to make any such
recordation shall not affect the obligations of such Borrower hereunder or
under any Bid Loan Note. Each Bid Loan Note shall be dated the Closing Date and
each Bid Loan evidenced thereby shall bear interest for the period from and
including the Borrowing Date thereof on the unpaid principal amount thereof
from time to time outstanding at the applicable rate per annum determined as
provided in, and such interest shall be payable as specified in, subsection
4.4.

SECTION 5. LOAN FACILITY COMMON PROVISIONS

5.1 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar
Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect
thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.

(b) Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate
per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4.4, if all or
a portion of (i) the principal amount of any Loan or (ii) any interest payable
thereon shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate
per annum which is (x) in the case of overdue principal, the rate that would
otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
subsection plus 2% or (y) in the case of overdue interest, the rate described
in paragraph (b) of this subsection plus 2%, in each case from the date of such
non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before
judgment).

(d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
subsection shall be payable on demand.

(e) Subject to the limitations set forth herein, each
Borrower may use the Loans by borrowing, prepaying and reborrowing the Loans,
all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

5.2 Facility Fee, etc. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee for the period
from and including the date hereof to the Termination Date, computed at the
rate per annum determined as set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection on
the average daily amount of the Commitment of such Bank during the period for
which payment is made, payable quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth day of
each March, June, September and December and on the Termination Date or such
earlier date as the Commitments shall terminate as provided herein, commencing
on the first of such dates to occur after the date hereof.

(b) The rate per annum at which such facility fee under
paragraph (a) above shall be computed (the "Applicable Facility Fee Rate"), for
any day on which the long term senior unenhanced, unsecured debt of the Company
is rated by both S&P and Moody's, shall be the rate per annum under the caption
"Facility Fee Rate" (a "Facility Fee Rate") set forth below opposite the S&P
and Moody's ratings applicable to such debt on such day (or, if such ratings
are set opposite two different rates under said caption, then the Applicable
Facility Fee Rate shall be the lower of said two Facility Fee Rates):

<PAGE>

Page

FACILITY FEE
RATE                   S&P                       MOODY'S

.1500%                 BB+ or lower              Ba1 or lower

.1000%                 BBB-                      Baa3

.0850%                 BBB                       Baa2

.0650%                 BBB+                      Baa1

.0550%                 A- or higher              A3 or higher

provided that if on any day the long term senior unenhanced, unsecured debt of
the Company is rated by only one of S&P or Moody's, such rate will be
determined based on the rating by such rating agency, and provided, further,
that if on any day the long term senior unenhanced, unsecured debt of the
Company is rated by neither S&P nor Moody's, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate
will be determined based on the rating of such debt by a Substitute Rating
Agency and will be the Facility Fee Rate set forth above opposite the S&P and
Moody's ratings comparable to the Substitute Rating Agency's rating of such
debt on such date, and provided, further, that if on any day the long term
senior unenhanced, unsecured debt of the Company is rated by none of S&P,
Moody's or any Substitute Rating Agency, the Company, the Administrative Agent
and the Banks will negotiate in good faith to determine an alternative basis
for calculating such rate consistent with the table set forth above and, if
agreement on such alternative basis is not reached with 30 days, such rate will
be calculated on an alternative basis determined by the Administrative Agent
and the Banks in their reasonable discretion consistent with the table above,
and until such alternative basis is determined such rate will be the rate last
determined as provided in the table above.

(c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent on
the Closing Date for the account of each Bank an upfront fee in an amount equal
to (i) the rate set forth below opposite the aggregate amount of such Bank's
initial Commitment on the Closing Date (the "Initial Commitment") multiplied by
(ii) such Bank's Initial Commitment:

Initial Commitment                    Rate
$50,000,000 or higher                   .125%
$35,000,000                        .100%
$25,000,000                        .075%
$17,000,000                        .050%

<PAGE>



(d) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and
the Arranger the fees in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in
writing by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Arranger.

5.3 Termination or Reduction of Commitments; Change of
Control Date. (a) The Company shall have the right, upon not less than five
Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Commitments
or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Commitments, provided that
no such termination or reduction shall be permitted to the extent that, after
giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of Loans made on the effective
date thereof, the sum of the aggregate Loan Outstandings of all the Banks, plus
the Aggregate Outstanding Bilateral Option Loans would exceed the Commitments
then in effect. Any such partial reduction shall be in an amount equal to
$5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce
permanently the Commitments then in effect.

(b) (i) In the event that a Change of Control Date shall
occur, (A) the Company shall, within 10 days after such Change of Control Date,
give each Bank notice thereof in writing describing in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances giving rise thereto, and (B) such Bank, by written
notice given to the Company not later than 30 days after the Change of Control
Date, may declare the Commitments of such Bank to be terminated in full or
reduced as of the date of (or as of a later date specified in) such notice to
the Company, and may require that the Borrowers prepay as provided in this
subsection 5.3 any Loans payable to such Bank and outstanding on such date to
the extent the principal amount thereof exceeds such Bank's Commitment, if any,
remaining after such termination or reduction. To the extent such Bank so
requires, the Borrowers shall prepay such Loans on the 75th day after the date
of the Company's notice or, in the event such 75th day is not a Business Day,
the Business Day next succeeding such 75th day ("Prepayment Date").

(ii) On the Prepayment Date, the Borrowers shall prepay
the unpaid principal amount of the Loans payable to such Bank, without premium
or penalty, together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the
Prepayment Date.

(iii) Subsections 5.9(a), (b) and (c) shall not apply to
prepayments under this subsection 5.3(b).

(iv) Paragraph (a) of this subsection 5.3 hereof shall
not apply to any Commitment reductions pursuant to this paragraph (b).

(v) In the event that a Change of Control Date shall
occur, the Company shall not thereafter, without the prior written consent of
the Majority Banks, borrow any additional Loan (other than a Bilateral Option
Loan) in order to make, directly or indirectly, any payment or prepayment on
any Indebtedness subordinated as to the payment of principal and interest or on
liquidation to the prior payment of any of the Obligations.

5.4 Prepayments. (a) Any Borrower may at any time and from
time to time upon at least four Business Days' irrevocable notice to the
Administrative Agent, in the case of Eurodollar

<PAGE>

Page

Loans, or upon at least one Business Day's irrevocable notice to the
Administrative Agent, in the case of ABR Loans, prepay the Loans (other than
Bid Loans), in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (subject to
subsection 5.13), specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether the
prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans or a combination thereof, and, if
of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. Upon receipt of any
such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank thereof.
If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due
and payable on the date specified therein. Partial prepayments shall be in an
aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof.

(b) If at any time, the Administrative Agent shall determine
(which determination shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error) that
the sum of the aggregate Loan Outstandings of all the Banks plus the Aggregate
Outstanding Bilateral Option Loans exceeds the aggregate Commitments, the
Borrowers shall immediately prepay the Loans in an aggregate principal amount
equal to such excess.

5.5 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) Any Borrower may
elect at any time and from time to time (subject to subsection 5.13) to convert
its Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least
two Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election. Any Borrower may
elect at any time and from time to time to convert its ABR Loans to Eurodollar
Loans by giving the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice of such election
(which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 4:00 P.M.,
New York City time, three Business Days prior to the requested conversion
date). Any such notice of conversion to Eurodollar Loans shall specify the
length of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor. Upon
receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Bank thereof. All or any part of outstanding Eurodollar Loans and ABR Loans may
be converted as provided herein, provided that (i) no Loan may be converted
into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
and the Administrative Agent or the Majority Banks have determined that such a
conversion is not appropriate, and (ii) any such conversion may only be made
if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 5.6 shall not have been
contravened.

(b) Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the
expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the
Borrower thereof giving notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in subsection
1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans,
provided that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such (i) when any Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the
Majority Banks have determined that such a continuation is not appropriate, or
(ii) if, after giving effect thereto, subsection 5.6 would be contravened and
provided, further, that if any Borrower shall fail to give any required notice
as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted
pursuant to the preceding proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted
to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.

5.6 Minimum Amounts of Eurodollar Tranches. All borrowings,
conversions and continuations of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest
Periods hereunder shall be in such

<PAGE>

Page

amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect
thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising each Eurodollar
Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof.

5.7 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest on ABR
Loans and facility fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as
the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. Interest on Eurodollar
Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual days
elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the
Borrowers and the Banks of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change
in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Prime Rate shall
become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change
in the Prime Rate is announced. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
practicable notify the Borrowers and the Banks of the effective date and the
amount of each such change in interest rate.

(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrowers and the Banks in the absence of
manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Company,
deliver to the Company a statement showing in reasonable detail the quotations
and calculations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest
rate pursuant to subsections 5.1 and 5.7(a).

5.8 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. In the event that
prior to the first day of any Interest Period:

(a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers)
that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market,
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or

(b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Majority Banks that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be
determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Banks (as conclusively certified by such
Banks) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such
Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to
the Borrowers and the Banks as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice
is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such
Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans that were to have
been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans
shall be continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall
be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until
such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further
Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall any Borrower
have the right to convert Loans to Eurodollar Loans.

5.9 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing by
any Borrower of Revolving Credit Loans from the Banks hereunder, each payment
by the Company on account of any

<PAGE>

Page

facility fee hereunder, and any reduction of the Commitments of the Banks shall
be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment Percentages of the
Banks.

(b) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent
or any Bank under this Agreement or any Note is insufficient to pay in full all
amounts then due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Banks under
this Agreement and the Notes, and the Administrative Agent has not received a
Payment Sharing Notice (or if the Administrative Agent has received a Payment
Sharing Notice but the Event of Default specified in such Payment Sharing
Notice has been cured or waived), such payment shall be distributed and applied
by the Administrative Agent and the Banks in the following order: first, to the
payment of fees and expenses due and payable to the Administrative Agent in its
capacity as Administrative Agent under and in connection with this Agreement;
second, to the payment of all expenses due and payable under subsection 13.5,
ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate amount of such
payments owed to each such Bank; third, to the payment of fees due and payable
under subsections 5.2(a) and (b), ratably among the Banks in accordance with
their Commitment Percentages; fourth, to the payment of interest then due and
payable on the Loans, ratably among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate
amount of interest owed to each such Bank; and fifth, to the payment of the
principal amount of the Loans which is then due and payable, ratably among the
Banks in accordance with the aggregate principal amount owed to each such Bank.

(c) After the Administrative Agent has received a Payment
Sharing Notice which remains in effect, all payments received by the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note shall be distributed and
applied by the Administrative Agent and the Banks in the following order:
first, to the payment of all amounts described in clauses first through third
of the foregoing paragraph (b), in the order set forth therein; and second, to
the payment of the interest accrued on and the principal amount of all of the
Loans, regardless of whether any such amount is then due and payable, ratably
among the Banks in accordance with the aggregate accrued interest plus the
aggregate principal amount owed to such Bank.

(d) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by any
Borrower hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal,
interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and
shall be made prior to 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the due date thereof
(i) in the case of fees and Loans other than Bilateral Option Loans, to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Banks, at the Administrative
Agent's office specified in subsection 13.2, and (ii) in the case of Bilateral
Option Loans made by any Bank, to such Bank, at the Bank's office specified in
Schedule I (or, with respect to Alternative Currency Bilateral Loans, if
different, at such other office of the Bank that it shall designate), in each
case in Dollars (or, with respect to Alternative Currency Bilateral Loans, in
the relevant Alternative Currency) and in immediately available funds. If any
payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (unless,
with respect to any payment on a Eurodollar Loan, the result of such extension
would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event
such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day), and,
with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the
then applicable rate during such extension.

<PAGE>

Page

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified
in writing by the Bank prior to a Borrowing Date that such Bank will not make
the amount of any Loan it has committed to make on such date available to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has
made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date,
and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is
made available to the Administrative Agent on a date after such Borrowing Date,
such Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to
the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during such
period, times (ii) the amount of the Loan such Bank was committed to make,
times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse
from and including such Borrowing Date to the date on which such Bank's Loan
shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent and the
denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent
submitted to any Bank with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Bank's Commitment
Percentage of such borrowing is not in fact made available to the
Administrative Agent by such Bank within three Business Days of such Borrowing
Date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount with
interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on
demand, from such Borrower.

5.10 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein,
if any change after the date hereof in any Requirement of Law or in the
interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Bank to
make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the
commitment of such Bank hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar
Loans as such and convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be
cancelled and (b) such Bank's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if
any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days
of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such
earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan
occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period
with respect thereto, the Borrower of such Loan shall pay to such Bank such
amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to subsection 5.13.

5.11 Requirements of Law. (a) In the event that any change
after the date hereof in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

(i) shall subject any Bank to any tax of any kind
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Note or any Eurodollar
Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such
Bank in respect thereof (except for taxes covered by subsection 5.12
and changes in taxes based upon or measured by income of such Bank);

(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement
against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the
account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any
other

<PAGE>

Page

acquisition of funds by, any office of such Bank which is not
otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate
hereunder; or

(iii) shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank, by
an amount which such Bank deems in its reasonable judgment to be material, of
making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or to
reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof then, in any such
case, the Company shall promptly pay such Bank, upon its demand, any additional
amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduced
amount receivable. If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts
pursuant to this subsection, it shall promptly notify the Company, through the
Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so
entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
subsection setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail (as
determined by such Bank in its reasonable discretion) submitted by such Bank,
through the Administrative Agent, to the Company shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b) In the event that any Bank shall have determined that any
change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Bank or any
corporation controlling such Bank with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank
or such corporation could have achieved but for such change or compliance
(taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material,
then from time to time, after submission by such Bank to the Company (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Company
shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Bank for such reduction. A certificate as to any additional amount payable
pursuant to this subsection setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable
detail (as determined by such Bank in its reasonable discretion) through the
Administrative Agent, to the Company shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error.

(c) Upon request by any Bank, through the Administrative
Agent, from time to time, the Borrowers shall pay the cost of all Eurocurrency
Reserve Requirements applicable to the Eurodollar Loans made by such Bank. If a
Bank is or becomes entitled to receive payments in respect of Eurocurrency
Reserve Requirements, pursuant to this subsection 5.11(c), it shall promptly
notify the Borrowers thereof through the Administrative Agent. A certificate as
to the amount of such Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements setting forth the
calculation thereof in reasonable detail (as determined by such Bank in its
reasonable discretion) submitted by such Bank, through the Administrative
Agent, to the Borrowers shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment
of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

<PAGE>

5.12 Taxes. (a) All payments made by any Borrower under this
Agreement and any Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority, excluding, in the case of the Administrative
Agent and each Bank, net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of
net income taxes) that would not have been imposed on the Administrative Agent
or such Bank, as the case may be, in the absence of a present or former
connection between the jurisdiction of the government or taxing authority
imposing such tax and the Administrative Agent or such Bank (other than a
connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Bank having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under,
or enforced, this Agreement or any Notes) or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions and withholdings being hereinafter
called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent or any Bank hereunder or under any Notes,
the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such
Bank (after payment of all Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable
hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the
Notes. Whenever any Taxes are payable by any Borrower in respect of any payment
made hereunder, as promptly as possible thereafter any Borrower shall send to
the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Bank,
as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received
by such Borrower showing payment thereof. If such Borrower fails to pay any
Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the
Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, such Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Banks
for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the
Administrative Agent or any Bank as a result of any such failure. The

Company or the Administrative Agent, unless in any such case an event
(including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and

default by any Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or
continuation of Eurodollar Loans after such Borrower has given a notice

limitation, in each case, any such loss or expense arising from the

in good standing in each jurisdiction wherein, in the opinion of the Company
and the Parent, the conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties
requires such qualification and (c) is in compliance with all Requirements of
Law, except to the extent that the failure to comply with paragraph (a), (b) or
(c) of this subsection would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

Each Loan Party has the corporate power and authority to make, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is or will be a
party, and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize (i) in the
case of the Borrowers, the borrowings under this Agreement and any Notes to
which it is or will be a party on the terms and conditions hereof and thereof

Documents to which it is or will be a party. This Agreement has been, and any
Note and the other Loan Documents to which it is or will be a party will be,
duly executed and delivered on behalf of each relevant Loan Party. This
Agreement constitutes, and each of the Notes, if any, and the other Loan
Documents when executed and delivered will constitute, a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Loan Party thereto, enforceable against such Loan
Party in accordance with its terms, such enforceability subject to limitations

creditors' rights and by general equitable principles (whether applied in a
proceeding in equity or at law). No consent of any

<PAGE>

Page

other party (including stockholders of the Parent) and no consent, license,
approval or authorization of, or registration or declaration with, any
Governmental Authority is required to be obtained by any Loan Party in
connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or
enforceability of this Agreement and any Notes.

6.3 No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, the borrowings
hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof, will not violate or contravene
any material provision of any Requirement of Law or material Contractual
Obligation of the Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and will not
result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any material Lien (other
than Liens permitted under subsection 9.2) on any of its or their respective
properties or revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual
Obligation.

6.4 No Material Litigation. There is no legal action,
administrative proceeding or arbitration (whether or not purportedly on behalf
of the Parent or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) presently pending, or
to the knowledge of the Parent or the Company threatened, against or affecting
the Parent or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, except that the foregoing is
subject to the fact that the Parent and the Company cannot predict at this time
the results and impact, if any, of (i) those investigations and litigations
incorporated by reference in Item 3 of the Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997 referred to in subsection 6.6 to
the extent that inability to make such a prediction or determine liability is
stated in Item 3 and (ii) the governmental investigation and related matters
described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in
Item 3.

6.5 Ownership of Properties. Each of the Parent, the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is the tenant under valid leases or has good title
to substantially all its properties and assets, real and personal (except
defects in title and other matters that would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect), subject to no Lien except as permitted to
exist under subsection 9.2.

6.6 Financial Condition. The consolidated balance sheet of
the Parent (or its predecessor) and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 1997
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and
of cash flows (together with the related notes), included or incorporated in
the Parent's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 1997, present fairly in all material respects the financial
position of the Parent (or its predecessor) and its Subsidiaries as at such
dates and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the fiscal
years then ended. All of such financial statements, including the notes to such
financial statements, have been prepared in conformity with GAAP (subject, in
the case of interim statements, to normal year-end adjustments and to the fact
that such financial statements may be abbreviated and may omit footnotes or
contain incomplete footnotes) consistently applied throughout the periods
involved except as stated therein.
<PAGE>

Page

6.7 Disclosure of Contingent Liabilities. To the best of the
knowledge and belief of the Parent, neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any contingent obligation, liability for taxes, long-term
leases, unusual forward or other liabilities, which are material in amount in
relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole and which are not disclosed in the financial
statements (including the related notes) described in subsection 6.6 above.

6.8 ERISA. Each Plan that is intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code satisfies in all material respects the applicable
requirements for qualification under that Code Section. No Reportable Event has
occurred and is continuing with respect to any such Plan, and neither the
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability to the PBGC under
Section 4062 of ERISA with respect to any such Plan that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.9 Certain Federal Regulations. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is engaged in or will engage in the business of extending
credit for the purposes of "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within
the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the
Board, and no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used for any purpose
which violates, or which would be inconsistent with, the provisions of
Regulation U or X of the Board.

6.10 No Default. Neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual
Obligations in any respect which would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.

6.11 Taxes. (a) Each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries has
filed or caused to be filed all tax returns which, to the knowledge of the
Parent, are required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and
payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its
property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its
property by any Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity
of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and with respect to which adequate reserves to the extent required in
conformity with GAAP, have been provided on the books of the Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be) except insofar as the failure to make such
filings or payments would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; and (b) no tax Lien (other than a Lien permitted under subsection
9.2(a)) has been filed, and, to the knowledge of the Parent, no claim is being
asserted, with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.12 Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. None of the
Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company", or a
company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. None of the Parent, the Company or
any other Borrower is subject to regulation under any Federal or State statute
or regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

<PAGE>

Page


6.13 Purpose of Loans. The proceeds of the Loans shall be
used by the Borrowers for general corporate purposes (which may include
purchases by the Parent of its capital stock).

6.14 Environmental Matters. To the best of the knowledge of
the Parent, the operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries and all parcels
of real estate owned or operated by the Parent or its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all Environmental Laws, except where the failure to so comply
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.15 Principal Subsidiaries. Set forth on Schedule II are all
of the Principal Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.

6.16 Year 2000. Any reprogramming relating to the year 2000
required to permit the proper functioning, in and following the year 2000, in
all material respects, of (i) the computer systems of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) any material equipment of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
containing embedded microchips and the testing of all such systems and
equipment, as so reprogrammed, is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999.
The aggregate cost to the Parent and its Subsidiaries of such reprogramming and
testing and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of year 2000 to the
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, reprogramming
errors and the failure of others' systems or equipment) is not expected to
result in a Default or a Material Adverse Effect.

Company in good faith thereafter, plus fees and other costs related to

SECTION 11. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

11.1 Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints Chase as the Administrative Agent of such Bank under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and each such Bank irrevocably authorizes Chase,
as the Administrative Agent for such Bank, to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent.

11.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may
execute any of its duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by
or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents
or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

11.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other Loan Document (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for
any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party
or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or
provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection
with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
the Notes or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party to
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall
not be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of any Loan Party.

<PAGE>

Page

11.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
cablegram, telegram, telecopy, statement, order or other document or
conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of
legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Company, the
Parent or any other Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and
treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Majority Banks as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to
its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the Notes and
the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Banks,
and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of the Notes.

11.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a
Bank or any Loan Party referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or
Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the
event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative
Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks. The Administrative Agent shall
take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
reasonably directed by the Majority Banks; provided that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks.

11.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Banks.
Each Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any
of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates
has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
the Loan Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty
by the Administrative Agent to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the
Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and made its own decision to
make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and

<PAGE>

Page

creditworthiness of the Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative
Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Loan Parties which may come
into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

11.7 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by
the Loan Parties and without limiting the obligation of the Parent, the Company
and any other Borrower to do so), ratably according to the respective amounts
of their Commitments as in effect on the date on which the claim for indemnity
by the Administrative Agent is sought, from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any
time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the
Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent
in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the other Loan
Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided that no Bank shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements
in this subsection shall survive the payment of the Notes and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

11.8 Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Parent, the Company or
any other Borrower as though the Administrative Agent were not the
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. With respect
to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents as any Bank and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks" shall
include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

11.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Banks. If the
Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, then the Majority Banks shall appoint from among
the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, which successor agent shall be
approved by the Company, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the
rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its
appointment, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as
Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or
deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to
this Agreement or any holders of the Notes. After any retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the

<PAGE>


Page

provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

11.10 Co-Agents. None of the Co-Agents shall have any rights
or obligations under this Agreement except in its capacity as a Bank hereunder.

SECTION 12. GUARANTEES

12.1 Parent Guarantee. The Parent hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent and the Banks the prompt and
complete payment and performance by each of the Borrowers when due (whether at
the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations owing to
the Administrative Agent and the Banks by such Borrowers. This guarantee (the
"Parent Guarantee") shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations
of each of the Borrowers are indefeasibly paid in full, notwithstanding that
from time to time prior thereto any Borrower may be free from any Obligations.
The Parent agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall
make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Bank on account of its
liability under this Parent Guarantee, it will notify the Administrative Agent
and such Bank in writing that such payment is made under this Parent Guarantee
for such purpose. No payment or payments made by any Borrower or any other
Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Bank from
any Borrower or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any
offset or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in
reduction of or in payment of the Obligations of such Borrower shall be deemed
to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the Parent
under this Parent Guarantee, which shall remain obligated under this Parent
Guarantee, notwithstanding any such payment or payments until the Obligations
are paid in full.

12.2 Company Guarantee. The Company hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent and the Banks, the
prompt and complete payment and performance by each of the other Borrowers when
due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the
Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and the Banks by such Borrowers.
This guarantee (the "Company Guarantee") shall remain in full force and effect
until the Obligations of each such Borrower are indefeasibly paid in full,
notwithstanding that from time to time prior thereto any such Borrower may be
free from any Obligations. The Company agrees that whenever, at any time, or
from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any
Bank on account of its liability under this Company Guarantee, it will notify
the Administrative Agent and such Bank in writing that such payment is made
under this Company Guarantee for such purpose. No payment or payments made by
any such Borrower or any other Person or received or collected by the
Administrative Agent or any Bank from any such Borrower or any other Person by
virtue of any action or proceeding or any offset or appropriation or
application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of
the Obligations of such Borrowers shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or
otherwise affect

<PAGE>

Page

the liability of the Company under this Company Guarantee, which shall remain
obligated under this Company Guarantee, notwithstanding any such payment or
payments until the Obligations of such Borrowers are paid in full.

12.3 No Subrogation, Contribution, Reimbursement or
Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Parent Guarantee and
the Company Guarantee (together, the "Guarantees", each a "Guarantee"), the
Parent and the Company (together, the "Guaranteeing Parties," each a
"Guaranteeing Party") hereby irrevocably waives all rights which may have
arisen in connection with its Guarantee to be subrogated to any of the rights
(whether contractual, under the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 509 thereof,
under common law or otherwise) of the Administrative Agent or any Bank against
the Company or any other Borrowers (together, the "Guaranteed Parties", each a
"Guaranteed Party") for the payment of the Obligations. Each Guaranteeing Party
hereby further irrevocably waives all contractual, common law, statutory or
other rights of reimbursement, contribution, exoneration or indemnity (or any
similar right) from or against any Guaranteed Party or Parties or any other
Person which may have arisen in connection with its Guarantee. So long as the
Obligations remain outstanding, if any amount shall be paid by or on behalf of
any Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteeing Party on account of any of the rights
waived in this subsection, such amount shall be held by such Guaranteeing Party
in trust, segregated from other funds of such Guaranteeing Party, and shall,
forthwith upon receipt by such Guaranteeing Party, be turned over to the
Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guaranteeing Party
(duly endorsed by such Guaranteeing Party to the Administrative Agent, if
required), to be applied against the Obligations of such Guaranteed Party or
Parties, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative
Agent may determine. The provisions of this subsection as they apply to each of
the Guaranteeing Parties shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations
of its Guaranteed Party or Parties.

12.4 Amendments, etc., with respect to the Obligations. Each
Guaranteeing Party shall remain obligated under its Guarantee notwithstanding
that, without any reservation of rights against such Guaranteeing Party, and
without notice to or further assent by such Guaranteeing Party, any demand for
payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Bank
may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Bank, and any of the
Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of any other party
upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor
or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in
part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised,
waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Bank, and
this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents may be amended,
modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the
Administrative Agent or the Banks (or the Majority Banks, as the case may be)
may deem advisable from time to time in accordance with the provisions of
subsection 13.1(a), and any collateral security, guarantee or right of set-off
at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Bank for the payment of the
Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither
the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any obligation to protect,
secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the
Obligations or for the obligations of any Guaranteeing Party under its
Guarantee or any property subject thereto.

<PAGE>

Page

12.5 Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guaranteeing
Party waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual
of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the
Administrative Agent or any Bank upon its Guarantee or acceptance of its
Guarantee; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to
have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon the Guarantees; and
all dealings between the Borrowers and the Parent, on the one hand, and the
Administrative Agent and the Banks, on the other, shall likewise be
conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the
Guarantees. Each Guaranteeing Party waives diligence, presentment, protest,
notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand for payment and
notice of default or nonpayment to or upon any Guaranteed Party or such
Guaranteeing Party with respect to the Obligations. The Guarantees shall be
construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment
without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any
Note, any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any collateral
security therefor or guarantee or right of set-off with respect thereto at any
time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Bank, (b) any
defense, offset or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or
performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by any of the
Guaranteed Parties against the Administrative Agent or any Bank or (c) any
other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of any of
the Guaranteed Parties or such Guaranteeing Party) which constitutes, or might
be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of any of the
Guaranteed Parties for the Obligations of such Guaranteed Party, or of such
Guaranteeing Party under its Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance.
When the Administrative Agent is pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder
against any Guaranteeing Party, the Administrative Agent or any Bank may, but
shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have
against its Guaranteed Party or any other Person or against any collateral
security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect
thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Bank to pursue such
other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from such Guaranteed Party
or such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or
guarantee or to exercise such right of offset or any release of such Guaranteed
Party or such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or
right of offset, shall not relieve such Guaranteeing Party of any liability
under its Guarantee, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies,
whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative
Agent and the Banks against such Guaranteeing Party.

12.6 Reinstatement. Each Guarantee shall continue to be
effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any
part thereof, of any of the Obligations of any Guaranteed Party thereunder is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent
or any Bank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
reorganization of such Guaranteed Party or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar
officer for, such Guaranteed Party or any substantial part of any of its
property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

12.7 Payments. Each Guaranteeing Party hereby agrees that the
Obligations will be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Banks, as the case may be, without set-off or
counterclaim in Dollars or Alternative Currency, as

SECTION 13. MISCELLANEOUS

Neither this Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof
or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with
the provisions of this subsection. With the written consent of the Majority
Banks, the Administrative Agent, the Parent and the Company may, from time to
time, enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to
the Notes, if any, and the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any
provisions to this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or the other Loan Documents
or changing in any manner the rights of the Banks, the Parent or of the
Borrowers hereunder or thereunder or waiving, on such terms and conditions as
the Administrative Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the
requirements of this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or the other Loan
Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its consequences; provided,
however, that no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification
shall (i) reduce the amount or extend the maturity of any Loan or Note or any
installment thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
interest thereon, or reduce any fee payable to any Bank hereunder, or change
the amount of any Bank's Commitment, in each case without the consent of the
Bank affected thereby, or (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this
subsection or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Majority
Banks, or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Parent or any Borrower
of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, or amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 12, in each case
without the written consent of all the Banks, or (iii) amend, modify or waive
any provision of Section 11 without the written consent of the then
Administrative Agent. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or
modification shall apply equally to each of the Banks and shall be binding upon
the Parent, the Borrowers, the Banks, the Administrative Agent, all future
holders of the Notes, if any, and all future obligees under the Loans. In the
case of any waiver, the Parent, the Borrowers, the Banks and the Administrative
Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under
the outstanding Loans or Notes, if any, and any other Loan Documents, and any
Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
subsection 13.1(a), so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing the Borrowers and the Parent shall be permitted in their
discretion (but, if any Revolving Credit Loans are then outstanding, with the
consent of the Majority Banks (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld)) to amend this Agreement to replace one or more Banks without the
consent of any Bank to be so replaced pursuant to this subsection 13.1(b) (a
"Replaced Bank") and to provide for (w) the termination of the Commitments of
such Replaced Bank, (x) the addition to this Agreement of one or more other
banking institutions, or an increase in the Commitments of one or more of the
other Banks (with the consent of such other Banks), so that the total
Commitments

after giving effect to such amendment shall be in the same amount as the total
Commitments immediately before giving effect to such amendment, (y) if any
Loans are outstanding at the time of such amendment, the making of such
additional Loans by such new financial institutions or other Bank or Banks, as
the case may be, as may be necessary to repay in full the outstanding Loans of
such Replaced Bank together with interest thereon and all accrued fees and
indemnities with respect thereto immediately before giving effect to such
amendment and (z) such other modifications to this Agreement as may be
necessary to effect the replacement of such Replaced Bank.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection 13.1, if as a result of a change in any
Requirement of Law after the date hereof any Borrower or the Parent has become
obligated to, or reasonably believes that it will become obligated to pay to
any Bank any increased amount pursuant to subsection 5.11, 5.12 or 5.13, and
such Bank shall not have waived payment of such increased amounts, then the
Borrowers and the Parent may, if no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing and payment of any such increased amounts as have become due
has been made or appropriately provided for, upon five Business Days' notice to
the Administrative Agent and such Bank, amend this Agreement, without the
consent of any Bank or the Administrative Agent, to replace any one or more of
the Banks to which such increased amounts have become payable or would become
payable and to provide for the matters referred to in clauses (w), (x), (y) and
(z) of subsection 13.1(b), and such replaced Bank or Banks shall be deemed to
be Replaced Banks for purposes of such clauses.

liabilities"), provided, that the Company shall have no obligation hereunder to
the Administrative Agent or any Bank with respect to indemnified liabilities
arising from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Administrative Agent or any such Bank, (ii) legal proceedings commenced against
the Administrative Agent or any such Bank by any security holder or creditor
thereof arising out of and based upon rights afforded any such security holder
or creditor solely in its capacity as such, or (iii) legal proceedings
commenced against the Administrative Agent or any such Bank by any other Bank
or by any Transferee (as defined in subsection 13.6). The agreements in this
subsection shall survive repayment of the Loans or Notes, if any, and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

13.6  Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing
Banks.

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parent, the Borrowers, the Banks, the Administrative Agent, all
future holders of the Notes, if any, all future obligees under the Loans and
their respective successors and assigns, except that neither the Parent nor any
Borrower may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of each Bank.

(b) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one
or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any
Loan owing to such Bank, any Note held by such Bank, any Commitments of such
Bank or any other interest of such Bank hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of participating interests
to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement to the other
parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely
responsible for the performance thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of
any such Note, if any, and the obligee under any such Loan for all purposes
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the Parent, the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Parent and each of the
Borrowers agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the Loans
or the Notes, if any, are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall
have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its
participating interest in


<PAGE>


Page

amounts owing under this Agreement and any Loan or Note to the same extent as
if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Bank
under this Agreement or any Loan or Note, provided that such Participant shall
only be entitled to such right of set-off if it shall have agreed in the
agreement pursuant to which it shall have acquired its participating interest
to share with the Banks the proceeds thereof as provided in subsection 13.7.
The Parent and each of the Borrowers also agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of subsections 5.11, 5.12, 5.13 and 13.5 with respect
to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to
time; provided, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater
amount pursuant to such subsections than the transferor Bank would have been
entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred
by such transferor Bank to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.

(c) Any Bank may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to any
Bank or any affiliate thereof and, with the consent of the Company and upon
notice to the Administrative Agent, to one or more additional banks or
financial institutions ("Purchasing Banks") all or any part of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the Loans or the Notes, if any, pursuant
to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, substantially in the form of Exhibit H,
executed by such Purchasing Bank, such transferor Bank (and, in the case of a
Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or an affiliate thereof, by the Company
and the Administrative Agent) and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its
acceptance and recording in the Register. Upon such execution, delivery,
acceptance and recording, from and after the Transfer Effective Date determined
pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (x) the Purchasing Bank
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such
Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Bank
hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein, and (y) the transferor Bank
thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of a Commitment Transfer Supplement covering all or the remaining portion
of a transferor Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
transferor Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Such Commitment Transfer
Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to
the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Bank and the
resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by
such Purchasing Bank of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such
transferor Bank under this Agreement and the Loan or the Notes, if any. On or
prior to the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant to such Commitment
Transfer Supplement, the relevant Borrower, at its own expense, if the
Purchasing Bank so requests, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent in exchange for any surrendered Revolving Credit Note and Bid Loan Note a
new Revolving Credit Note and Bid Loan Note to the order of such Purchasing
Bank in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such
Commitment Transfer Supplement and, if the transferor Bank has retained a
Commitment hereunder, new Notes to the order of the transferor Bank in an
amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall
be dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Notes
replaced thereby. Any Notes surrendered by the transferor Bank shall be
returned by the Administrative Agent to the Company marked "cancelled".


<PAGE>

Page

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in subsection 13.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement
delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the
names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, and principal amount of
the Loans owing to, each Bank from time to time. The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Parent, the
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection
by the Parent, the Borrowers or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e) Upon its receipt of a Commitment Transfer Supplement
executed by a transferor Bank and Purchasing Bank (and, in the case of a
Purchasing Bank that is not then a Bank or an affiliate thereof, by the Company
and the Administrative Agent) together with payment to the Administrative Agent
of a registration and processing fee of $3,500, the Administrative Agent shall
(i) promptly accept such Commitment Transfer Supplement (ii) on the Transfer
Effective Date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained
therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to
the Banks and the Company.

(f) The Parent and the Borrowers authorizes each Bank to
disclose to any Participant or Purchasing Bank (each, a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Bank's
possession concerning such Borrower and its affiliates which has been delivered
to such Bank by or on behalf of the Parent, the Company or such Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Bank by or on
behalf of the Parent, the Company or such Borrower in connection with such
Bank's credit evaluation of such Borrower and its affiliates prior to becoming
a party to this Agreement.

(g) If, pursuant to this subsection, any interest in this
Agreement or any Note is transferred to any Transferee which is organized under
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof,
the transferor Bank shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to represent to the transferor Bank (for
the benefit of the transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent, the Parent and
the Borrowers) that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required
to be withheld by the Administrative Agent, the Parent, the Borrowers or the
transferor Bank with respect to any payments to be made to such Transferee in
respect of the Loans, (ii) to furnish to the transferor Bank (and, in the case
of any Purchasing Bank registered in the Register, the Administrative Agent,
the Parent and the Company) either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or
U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 (wherein such Transferee claims
entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all
interest payments hereunder) and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the
transferor Bank, the Administrative Agent, the Parent and the Company) to
provide the transferor Bank (and, in the case of any Purchasing Bank registered
in the Register, the Administrative Agent, the Parent and the Company) a new
Form 4224 or Form 1001 upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously
delivered form and comparable statements in accordance with applicable U.S.
laws and regulations and amendments duly executed and completed by such
Transferee, and to comply from time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and
regulations with regard to such withholding tax exemption.

(h) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Bank from pledging or
assigning any Note to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable
law.

13.7  Adjustments; Set-off.

(a) If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank") shall at any time
receive any payment of all or part of its Revolving Credit Loans, or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 10(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any
such payment to or collateral received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of
such other Bank's Revolving Credit Loans, or interest thereon, such benefitted
Bank shall purchase for cash from the other Banks such portion of each such
other Bank's Loan, or shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of any
such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with each of the Banks; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each
Borrower agrees that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's Loan
may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of
set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Bank were the direct
holder of such portion.

(b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, each Bank shall have the right, without prior notice to the
Parent and the Borrowers, any such notice being expressly waived by the Parent
and the Borrowers, to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount
not being paid when due and payable by any Borrower hereunder or under the
Notes (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off
and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other
credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct
or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or
owing by such Bank or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the
account of the Parent or such Borrower. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the
Parent, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

13.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or
more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts,
and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one
and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all
the parties shall be lodged with the Parent, the Company and the Administrative
Agent.

13.9 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

13.10 Integration. This Agreement represents the agreement of
the Parent, each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks with respect
to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings,
representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Bank relative
to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein, in the
other Loan Documents or in any documentation entered into pursuant to
subsection 3.1(b).

13.11 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING SECTION 12)
AND THE NOTES AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

13.12 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. (a) The Parent,
each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally:

(i) submits for itself and its property in any legal
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York sitting in New
York County, the courts of the United States of America for the
Southern District of New York, and the appellate courts from any
thereof;

(ii) consents that any such action or proceeding may be
brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any
such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an
inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

(iii) agrees that service of process in any such action
or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered
or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
prepaid, to the Parent or such Borrower at its address set forth in
subsection 13.2 or, with respect to Borrowers other than the Company,
the Notice of Additional Borrower relating to such Borrower or at such
other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been
notified pursuant thereto;

(iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right
to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or
shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

(v) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by
law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or
proceeding referred to in this subsection any special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages.

(b) Each Borrower other than the Company hereby appoints and
empowers the Parent and the Company, 1114 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
York 10036-7794, Attention: Treasurer, as its authorized agent (the "Process
Administrative Agent") to receive on behalf of such Borrower service of any and
all process and documents in any such legal action or


<PAGE>

Page

proceeding brought in a New York state or federal court sitting in New York
City. It is understood that a copy of such process served on the Process
Administrative Agent will be promptly hand delivered or mailed (by registered
or certified airmail if available), postage prepaid, to such Borrower at its
address set forth in paragraph 5 of such Borrower's Notice of Additional
Borrower, but the failure of such Borrower to receive such copy shall not
affect in any way the service of such process on the Process Administrative
Agent. If the Process Administrative Agent shall refuse or be prevented from
acting as agent, notice thereof shall immediately be given by such Borrowers to
the Administrative Agent by registered or certified airmail (if available),
postage prepaid, and such Borrowers agree promptly to designate another agent
in New York City, satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to serve in place
of the Process Administrative Agent and deliver to the Administrative Agent
written evidence of such substitute agent's acceptance of such designation.

13.13 Acknowledgments. The Parent, each Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Banks hereby acknowledge that:

(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the other
Loan Documents;

(b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank has any
fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Parent or such Borrower, as
the case may be, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between
Administrative Agent and Banks, on one hand, and the Parent and the
Borrowers, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is
solely that of debtor and creditor; and

(c) as to any matter relating to any Loan Documents, no joint
venture exists among the Banks or among the Parent, the Borrowers and
the Banks.

13.14 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARENT, THE BORROWERS, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

13.15 Additional Borrowers. (a) Any Subsidiary of the Company
shall have the right to become a "Borrower" hereunder, and to borrow hereunder
subject to the terms and conditions hereof applicable to a Borrower and to the
following additional conditions:

(i) the Company shall deliver a notice in substantially
the form of Exhibit I hereto (a "Notice of Additional Borrower")
signed by such Subsidiary and countersigned by the Parent and the
Company to the Administrative Agent and the Banks stating that such
Subsidiary desires to become a "Borrower" under this Agreement and
agrees to be bound by the terms hereof. From the time of receipt of
such Notice of Additional Borrower by the Administrative Agent and the
Banks and subject to the satisfaction of each condition precedent
contained in such Notice of Additional Borrower, such


<PAGE>

Page

Subsidiary shall be a "Borrower" hereunder with all of the rights and
obligations of a Borrower hereunder; provided, however, that the
Company may revoke a Notice of Additional Borrower with respect to any
Subsidiary (other than the Company) upon five Business Days' written
notice to the Administrative Agent, so long as such Borrower has no
Obligations outstanding. No Notice of Additional Borrower relating to
a Subsidiary may be revoked as to amounts owed by such Subsidiary to
the Banks under this Agreement or any Notes or when an irrevocable
notice pursuant to subsection 2.3, or a notice of acceptance pursuant
to subsection 3.1 or 4.2, has been given by such Subsidiary as a
Borrower and is effective;

(ii) if such Subsidiary is a Foreign Subsidiary, if
reasonably requested by the Majority Banks, such Notice of Additional
Borrower shall be accompanied by an opinion of counsel for such
Subsidiary as specified in paragraph 4(a)(ii) of such Notice of
Additional Borrower;

(iii) and the other conditions set forth in such Notice
of Additional Borrower shall have been satisfied (including the
representations and warranties contained therein being true and
correct as of the date thereof).

(b) Promptly, upon receipt of any Notice of Additional
Borrower by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Bank thereof, and shall deliver to each Bank copies of each document
delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to such Notice of Additional
Borrower.

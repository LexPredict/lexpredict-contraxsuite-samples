authorized officer of the Borrower and made payable to the Lender), $5,000 for
each engineering review.

<PAGE>

2.15 Loans to Satisfy Obligations of Borrower. The Lender may, but shall
not be obligated to, but only if an Event of Default exists, make Loans for the
benefit of the Borrower and apply proceeds thereof to the satisfaction of any
condition, warranty, representation, or covenant of the Borrower contained in
this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Any such Loan shall be evidenced by
the Note and shall be made as a Floating Rate Loan.

2.16 Security Interest in Accounts; Right of Offset. As security for the
payment and performance of the Obligations, the Borrower hereby transfers,
assigns, and pledges to the Lender grants to the Lender a security interest in
all funds of the Borrower now or hereafter or from time to time on deposit with
the Lender, with such interest of the Lender to be retransferred, reassigned,
and/or released by the Lender, at the expense of the Borrower upon payment in
full and complete performance by the Borrower of all Obligations. All remedies
as secured party or assignee of such funds shall be exercisable by the Lender
during the existence of the occurrence of any Event of Default, regardless of
whether the exercise of any such remedy would result in any penalty or loss of
interest or profit with respect to any withdrawal of funds deposited in a time
deposit account prior to the maturity thereof. Furthermore, the Borrower hereby
grants to the Lender the right, exercisable during the existence of an Event of
Default, of offset or banker's lien against all funds of the Borrower now or
hereafter or from time to time on deposit with the Lender, regardless of whether
the exercise of any such remedy would result in any penalty or loss of interest
or profit with respect to any withdrawal of funds deposited in a time deposit
account prior to the maturity thereof, provided that such Obligation shall have
matured, whether by acceleration of maturity or otherwise.

2.17 General Provisions Relating to Interest. (a) It is the intention of
the parties hereto to comply strictly with the usury laws of the State of Texas
and the United States of America. In this connection, there shall never be
collected, charged, or received on the sums advanced hereunder interest in
excess of that which would accrue at the Highest Lawful Rate. For purposes of
Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code (Vernon's 1999), the Borrower agrees that
the Highest Lawful Rate shall be the "weekly ceiling" as defined in such
Section, provided that the Lenders may also rely, to the extent permitted by
applicable laws of the State of Texas or the United States of America, on
alternative maximum rates of interest under other laws of the State of Texas or
the United States of America applicable to the Lender, if greater.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Note to the contrary,
during any Limitation Period, the interest rate to be charged on amounts
evidenced by the Note shall be the Highest Lawful Rate, and the obligation, if
any, of the Borrower for the payment of fees or other charges deemed to be
interest under applicable law shall be suspended. During any period or periods
of time following a Limitation Period, to the extent permitted by applicable
laws of the State of Texas or the United States of America, the interest rate to
be charged hereunder shall remain at the Highest Lawful Rate until such time as
there has been paid to the Lender (i) the amount of interest in excess of that
accruing at the Highest Lawful Rate that the Lender would have received during
the Limitation Period had the interest rate remained at the otherwise applicable
rate, and (ii) all interest and fees otherwise payable to the Lender but for the
effect of such Limitation Period.

<PAGE>

(c) If, under any circumstances, the aggregate amounts paid on the
Note or under this Agreement or any other Loan Document include amounts which by
law are deemed interest and which would exceed the amount permitted if the
Highest Lawful Rate were in effect, the Borrower stipulates that such payment
and collection will have been and will be deemed to have been, to the extent
permitted by applicable laws of the State of Texas or the United States of
America, the result of mathematical error on the part of the Borrower and the
Lender; and the Lenders shall promptly refund the amount of such excess (to the
extent only of such interest payments in excess of that which would have accrued
and been payable on the basis of the Highest Lawful Rate) upon discovery of such
error by the Lender or notice thereof from the Borrower. In the event that the
maturity of any Obligation is accelerated, by reason of an election by the
Lender or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment,
then the consideration constituting interest under applicable laws may never
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate; and excess amounts paid which by law are deemed
interest, if any, shall be credited by the Lender on the principal amount of the
Obligations, or if the principal amount of the Obligations shall have been paid
in full, refunded to the Borrower.

(d) All sums paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Lender for the use,
forbearance and detention of the proceeds of any advance hereunder shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and
spread throughout the full term hereof until paid in full so that the actual
rate of interest is uniform but does not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate
throughout the full term hereof.

2.18 Yield Protection. (a) Without limiting the effect of the other
provisions of this Section (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay to
the Lender from time to time such amounts as the Lender may determine are
necessary to compensate it for any Additional Costs incurred by the Lender.

(b) Without limiting the effect of the other provisions of this
Section (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay to the Lender from
time to time on request such amounts as the Lenders may determine are necessary
to compensate the Lender for any costs attributable to the maintenance by the
Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office), pursuant to any Regulatory Change, of
capital in respect of the Commitment, such compensation to include, without
limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of return on assets or
equity of the Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office) to a level below that
which the Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office) could have achieved but for
such Regulatory Change.

(c) Without limiting the effect of the other provisions of this
Section (but without duplication), in the event that any Requirement of Law or
Regulatory Change or the compliance by the Lender therewith shall (i) impose,
modify, or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement
against any Letter of Credit or obligation to issue Letters of Credit, or (ii)
impose upon the Lender any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit or
obligation to issue Letters of Credit, and the result of any such event shall be
to increase the cost to the Lender of issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or obligation to issue Letters of Credit or any liability with respect to
payments by the Lender under Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount
receivable in connection therewith, then within 15 days of demand by the

<PAGE>

Lender, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, from time to time as specified by
the Lender, additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the
Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.

(d) Without limiting the effect of the other provisions of this
Section (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay to the Lender such
amounts as shall be sufficient in the reasonable opinion of the Lender to
compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense incurred by and as a result of:

(i) any payment, prepayment, or conversion by the Borrower of
a LIBO Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period for such Loan; or

(ii) any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBO Rate Loan
from the Lender on the date for such borrowing specified in the
relevant Borrowing Request;

such compensation to include, without limitation, with respect to any LIBO Rate
Loan, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest which
would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, converted, or not
borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, conversion,
or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current Interest Period for
such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such
Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to borrow) at the
applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein over (B) the
interest component (as reasonably determined by the Lender) of the amount (as
reasonably determined by the Lender) the Lender would have bid in the London
interbank market for Dollar deposits of amounts comparable to such principal
amount and maturities comparable to such period; provided, however, that the
Lender shall be limited to recover their actual losses and not anticipated
profits.

(e) Determinations by the Lender for purposes of this Section of the
effect of any Regulatory Change on capital maintained, their costs or rate of
return, maintaining Loans, issuing Letters of Credit, its obligation to make
Loans and issue Letters of Credit, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of
Loans, Letters of Credit, or such obligations, and the additional amounts
required to compensate the Lender under this Section shall be rebuttable
presumptions of the additional amounts due, provided that such determinations
are made on a reasonable basis. The Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a
certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and amount of increased
costs incurred or reduced amounts receivable as a result of any such event, and
the statements set forth therein shall be rebuttable presumptions of the
additional amounts due. The Lender shall (i) notify the Borrower, as promptly as
practicable after the Lender obtains knowledge of any Additional Costs or other
sums payable pursuant to this Section and determines to request compensation
therefore, of any event occurring after the Closing Date which will entitle the
Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section; provided that the Borrower
shall not be obligated for the payment of any Additional Costs or other sums
payable pursuant to this Section after the earlier of (A) the Final Maturity
(provided that the Obligations have been paid in full) and (B) the expiration of
the Commitment (provided that the

<PAGE>

Obligations have been paid in full) to the extent such Additional Costs or
other sums accrued more than 90 days prior to the date upon which the Borrower
was given such notice; and (ii) designate a different Applicable Lending Office
for the Loans of the Lender affected by such event if such designation will
avoid the need for or reduce the amount of such compensation and will not, in
the sole opinion of the Lender, be materially disadvantageous to the Lender. If
the Lender request compensation from the Borrower under this Section, the
Borrower may, by notice to the Lender, require that the Loans by the Lender of
the type with respect to which such compensation is requested be converted into
Floating Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.10. Any compensation requested
by the Lender pursuant to this Section shall be due and payable to the Lender
within fifteen days of delivery of any such notice by the Lender to the
Borrower.

(f) The Lender agrees that it shall not request, and the Borrower
shall not be obligated to pay, any Additional Costs or other sums payable
pursuant to this Section unless similar additional costs and other sums payable
are also generally assessed by the Lender against other customers of the Lender
similarly situated where such customers are subject to documents providing for
such assessment.

2.19 Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no more than 5 separate Loans shall be outstanding at any one
time, with, for purposes of this Section, all Floating Rate Loans constituting
one Loan and all LIBO Rate Loans for the same Interest Period constituting one
Loan. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the
determination of any interest rate for any LIBO Rate Loan for any Interest
Period therefor:

(a) the Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
that quotations of interest rates for the deposits referred to in the
definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.2 are not being provided in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of
determining the rate of interest for such Loan as provided in this
Agreement; or

(b) the Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
that the rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" in
Section 1.2 upon the basis of which the rate of interest for such Loan for
such Interest Period is to be determined do not accurately reflect the
cost to the Lenders of making or maintaining such Loan for such Interest
Period,

then the Lender shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof; and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lender shall be under no obligation to
make LIBO Rate Loans or to convert Loans of any other type into LIBO Rate Loans,
and the Borrower shall, on the last day of the then current Interest Period for
each outstanding LIBO Rate Loan, either prepay such LIBO Rate Loan or convert
such Loan into another type of Loan in accordance with Section 2.10. Before
giving such notice pursuant to this Section, the Lender will designate a
different available Applicable Lending Office for LIBO Rate Loans or take such
other action as the Borrower may request if such designation or action will
avoid the need to suspend the obligation of the Lender

<PAGE>

to make LIBO Rate Loans hereunder and will not, in the opinion of the Lender, be
materially disadvantageous to the Lender.

2.20 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
the event that it becomes unlawful for the Lender or their Applicable Lending
Office to (a) honor its obligation to make any type of LIBO Rate Loans
hereunder, or (b) maintain any type of LIBO Rate Loans hereunder, then the
Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof; and the obligation of the
Lender hereunder to make such type of LIBO Rate Loans and to convert other types
of Loans into LIBO Rate Loans of such type shall be suspended until such time as
the Lender may again make and maintain LIBO Rate Loans of such type, and the
outstanding LIBO Rate Loans of such type shall be converted into Floating Rate
Loans in accordance with Section 2.10. Before giving such notice pursuant to
this Section, the Lender will designate a different available Applicable Lending
Office for LIBO Rate Loans or take such other action as the Borrower may request
if such designation or action will avoid the need to suspend the obligation of
the Lenders to make LIBO Rate Loans and will not, in the opinion of the Lender,
be disadvantageous to the Lender.

2.21 Regulatory Change. In the event that by reason of any Regulatory
Change, the Lender (a) incur Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess
above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other
liabilities of the Lender which includes deposits by reference to which the
interest rate on any LIBO Rate Loan is determined as provided in this Agreement
or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which
includes any LIBO Rate Loan, or (b) becomes subject to restrictions on the
amount of such a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, at
the election of the Lender with notice to the Borrower, the obligation of the
Lender to make such LIBO Rate Loans and to convert Floating Rate Loans into such
LIBO Rate Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Regulatory Change
ceases to be in effect, and all such outstanding LIBO Rate Loans shall be
converted into Floating Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.10.

2.22 Limitations on Interest Periods. Each Interest Period selected by the
Borrower (a) which commences on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or,
with respect to any LIBO Rate Loan, any day for which there is no numerically
corresponding day in the appropriate subsequent calendar month) shall end on the
last Business Day of the appropriate subsequent calendar month, (b) which would
otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day (or, with respect to any LIBO Rate Loan, if such next
succeeding Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, on the next
preceding Business Day), (c) which would otherwise commence before and end after
Final Maturity shall end on Final Maturity, and (d) shall have a duration of not
less than one month, as to any LIBO Rate Loan, and, if any Interest Period would
otherwise be a shorter period, the relevant Loan shall be a Floating Rate Loan
during such period.

2.23 Letters in Lieu of Transfer Orders. The Lender agrees that none of
the letters in lieu of transfer or division orders provided by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 3.1(f)(iii) or Section 5.8 will be sent to the addressees
thereof prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default,

<PAGE>

at which time the Lender may, at its option and in addition to the exercise of
any of its other rights and remedies, send any or all of such letters.

2.24 Power of Attorney. The Borrower hereby designates the Lender as its
Lender and attorney-in-fact, to act in its name, place, and stead for the
purpose of completing and, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
delivering any and all of the letters in lieu of transfer orders delivered by
the Borrower to the Lender pursuant to Section 3.1(f)(iii) or Section 5.8,
including, without limitation, completing any blanks contained in such letters
and attaching exhibits thereto describing the relevant Collateral. The Borrower
hereby ratifies and confirms all that the Lender shall lawfully do or cause to
be done by virtue of this power of attorney and the rights granted with respect
to such power of attorney. This power of attorney is coupled with the interests
of the Lender in the Collateral, shall commence and be in full force and effect
as of the Closing Date and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
irrevocable so long as any Obligation remains outstanding or unpaid or any
Commitment exists. The powers conferred on the Lender by this appointment are
solely to protect the interests of the Lender under the Loan Documents and shall
not impose any duty upon the Lender to exercise any such powers. The Lender
shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of
the exercise of such powers and shall not be responsible to the Borrower or any
other Person for any act or failure to act with respect to such powers, except
for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans
and issue Letters of Credit, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender
(which representations and warranties shall survive the delivery of the Note)
that:

4.1 Due Authorization. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of this
Agreement and the borrowings hereunder, the execution and delivery by the
Borrower of the Note, the repayment of the Note and interest and fees provided
for in the Note and this Agreement, the execution and delivery of the Security
Instruments by the Borrower and the performance of all obligations of the
Borrower under the Loan Documents are within the power of the Borrower, have
been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability company action by the
Borrower, and do not and will not (a) require the consent of any Governmental
Authority, (b) contravene or conflict with any Requirement of Law, (c) except as
shown on Exhibit VI, contravene or conflict with any indenture, instrument, or
other agreement to which the Borrower is a party or by which any Property of the
Borrower may be presently bound or encumbered, except where such contravention
or conflict would not individually or in the aggregate result in a Material
Adverse Effect, or (d) result in or require the creation or imposition of any
Lien in, upon or of any Property of the Borrower under any such indenture,
instrument, or other agreement, other than the Loan Documents.

4.2 Limited Liability Company Existence. The Borrower is a limited
liability company duly organized, legally existing, and in good standing under
the laws of its state of formation and is duly qualified as foreign limited
liability company and is in good standing in all

<PAGE>

jurisdictions wherein the ownership of Property or the operation of its business
necessitates same, other than those jurisdictions wherein the failure to so
qualify will not have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.3 Valid and Binding Obligations. All Loan Documents, when duly executed
and delivered by the Borrower, will be the legal, valid, and binding obligations
of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their
respective terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally or by equitable principles relative to enforceability.

4.4 Security Instruments. The provisions of each Security Instrument are
effective to create in favor of the Lender, a legal, valid, and enforceable Lien
in all right, title, and interest of the Borrower in the Collateral described
therein, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally or by equitable principles relative to enforceability, which Liens,
assuming the accomplishment of recording and filing in accordance with
applicable laws prior to the intervention of rights of other Persons, shall
constitute fully perfected first-priority Liens on all right, title, and
interest of the Borrower in the Collateral described therein subject to
Permitted Liens.

4.5 Title to Assets. The Borrower has good and indefeasible title to all
of its interests in its Properties then owned by it, free and clear of all Liens
except Permitted Liens.

4.6 No Material Misstatements. As of the Closing Date, no information,
exhibit, statement, or report furnished to the Lender by or at the direction of
the Borrower in connection with this Agreement contains any material
misstatement of fact or omits to state a material fact or any fact necessary to
make the statements contained therein not misleading as of the date made or
deemed made.

4.7 Liabilities, Litigation, and Restrictions. As of the Closing Date,
other than as listed under the heading "Liabilities" on Exhibit VI attached
hereto, the Borrower has no liabilities, direct, or contingent, which would
result in a Material Adverse Effect, except as set forth under the heading
"Litigation" on Exhibit VI hereto, no litigation or other action of any nature
affecting the Borrower is pending before any Governmental Authority or, to the
best knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower
which might reasonably be expected to result in any material impairment of its
ownership of any Collateral or have a Material Adverse Effect. To the best
knowledge of the Borrower, after due inquiry, no unusual or unduly burdensome
restriction, restraint or hazard exists by contract, Requirement of Law, or
otherwise relative to the business or operations of the Borrower or the
ownership and operation of the Collateral would result in a Material Adverse
Effect, other than such as relate generally to Persons engaged in business
activities similar to those conducted by the Borrower.

4.8 Authorizations; Consents. Except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, no authorization, consent, approval, exemption, franchise, permit, or
license of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is
required to authorize or is otherwise required in connection with the valid
execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or

<PAGE>

any instrument contemplated hereby, the repayment by the Borrower of the Note
and interest and fees provided in the Note and this Agreement, or the
performance by the Borrower of the Obligations.

4.9 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower and its Property, including,
without limitation, the Mortgaged Property, are in compliance with all material
applicable Requirements of Law, including, without limitation, Environmental
Laws, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended, and ERISA, except to the
extent non-compliance with any such Requirements of Law could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.10 ERISA. No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Single
Employer Plan, and each Single Employer Plan has complied with and been
administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable provisions
of ERISA and the Code. To the knowledge of the Borrower, (a) no Reportable Event
has occurred with respect to any Multiemployer Plan, and (b) each Multiemployer
Plan has complied with and been administered in all material respects with
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. The present value of all benefits
vested under each Single Employer Plan maintained by the Borrower or any
Commonly Controlled Entity (based on the assumptions used to fund such Plan) did
not, as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto, exceed the value
of the assets of such Plan allocable to such vested benefits. Neither the
Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial
withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan for which there is any withdrawal
liability. As of the most recent valuation date applicable to any Multiemployer
Plan, neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become
subject to any liability under ERISA if the Borrower or such Commonly Controlled
Entity were to withdraw completely from such Multiemployer Plan. Neither the
Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has received notice that any
Multiemployer Plan is Insolvent or in Reorganization. To the knowledge of the
Borrower, no such Insolvency or Reorganization is reasonably likely to occur.
Based upon GAAP existing as of the date of this Agreement and current factual
circumstances, the Borrower has no reason to believe that the annual cost during
the term of this Agreement to the Borrower and all Commonly Controlled Entities
for post-retirement benefits to be provided to the current and former employees
of the Borrower and all Commonly Controlled Entities under Plans which are
welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) will, in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.11 Environmental Laws. To the knowledge and belief of the Borrower,
except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or as described on Exhibit
VI under the heading "Environmental Matters:"

(a) no Property of the Borrower is currently on or has ever been on,
or is adjacent to any Property which is on or has ever been on, any
federal or state list of Superfund Sites;

(b) no Hazardous Substances have been generated, transported, and/or
disposed of by the Borrower at a site which was, at the time of such
generation, transportation, and/or disposal, or has since become, a
Superfund Site;

<PAGE>

(c) except in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law or the
terms of a valid permit, license, certificate, or approval of the relevant
Governmental Authority, no Release of Hazardous Substances by the Borrower
or from, affecting, or related to any Property of the Borrower or adjacent
to any Property of the Borrower has occurred; and

(d) no Environmental Complaint has been received by the Borrower.

4.12 Compliance with Federal Reserve Regulations. No transaction
contemplated by the Loan Documents is in violation of any regulations
promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, including,
without limitation, Regulations G, T, U, or X.

Borrower directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of any Person
which is, an "investment company" or an "affiliated person" of an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

4.14 Public Utility Holding Company Act Compliance. The Borrower is not a
"holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

4.15 Proper Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes Due. The Borrower has
duly and properly filed its United States income tax return and all other tax
returns which are required to be filed and has paid all taxes due except such as
are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate provisions and
disclosures have been made. The respective charges and reserves on the books of
the Borrower with respect to taxes and other governmental charges are adequate.

4.16 Refunds. Except as described on Exhibit VI under the heading
"Refunds," no orders of, proceedings pending before, or other requirements of,
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Texas Railroad Commission, or any
Governmental Authority exist which could result in the Borrower being required
to refund any material portion of the proceeds received or to be received from
the sale of hydrocarbons constituting part of the Mortgaged Property.

4.17 Gas Contracts. Except as described on Exhibit VI under the heading
"Gas Contracts," the Borrower (a) is not obligated in any material respect by
virtue of any prepayment made under any contract containing a "take-or-pay" or
"prepayment" provision or under any similar agreement to deliver hydrocarbons
produced from or allocated to any of the Mortgaged Property at some future date
without receiving full payment therefor within 90 days of delivery, and (b) has
not produced gas, in any material amount, subject to, and neither the Borrower
nor any of the Mortgaged Properties is subject to, balancing rights of third
parties or subject to balancing duties under governmental requirements, except
as to such matters for which the Borrower has reflected in the most recent
engineering report or established monetary reserves adequate in amount to
satisfy such obligations and has segregated such reserves from other accounts.

<PAGE>

4.18 Intellectual Property. The Borrower owns or is licensed to use all
Intellectual Property necessary to conduct all business material to its
financial condition, business, or operations as such business is currently
conducted. No claim has been asserted or is pending by any Person with the
respect to the use of any such Intellectual Property or challenging or
questioning the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property; and
the Borrower knows of no valid basis for any such claim. The use of such
Intellectual Property by the Borrower does not infringe on the rights of any
Person, except for such claims and infringements as do not, in the aggregate,
give rise to any material liability on the part of the Borrower.

4.19 Casualties or Taking of Property. Except as disclosed on Exhibit VI
under the heading "Casualties," except as would not result in a Material Adverse
Effect, neither the business nor any Property of the Borrower has been
materially adversely affected as a result of any fire, explosion, earthquake,
flood, drought, windstorm, accident, strike or other labor disturbance, embargo,
requisition or taking of Property, or cancellation of contracts, permits, or
concessions by any Governmental Authority, riot, activities of armed forces, or
acts of God.

4.20 Locations of Borrower. The principal place of business and chief
executive office of the Borrower is located at the address of the Borrower set
forth in Section 8.3 or at such other location as the Borrower may have, by
proper written notice hereunder, advised the Lender, provided that such other
location is within a state in which appropriate financing statements from the
Borrower in favor of the Lender have been filed.

4.21 Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date, the Borrower has no
Subsidiaries except those described on Exhibit VI under the heading
"Subsidiaries".

grant participations in the Obligation or any portion thereof; and the Lender
may forward to each Transferee and prospective Transferee all documents and
information relating to such Obligations, whether furnished by the Borrower or
otherwise obtained, as the Lender determines necessary or desirable. The
Borrower agrees that each Transferee, regardless of the nature of any transfer
to it, may exercise all rights (including, without limitation, rights of
set-off) with respect to the portion of the Obligations held by it as fully as
if such Transferee were the direct holder thereof, subject to any agreements
between such Transferee and the transferor to such Transferee.

8.2 Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Covenants. All

GUARANTY BANK, FSB
333 CLAY STREET, SUITE 4400
HOUSTON, TEXAS  77002
Attention:  Richard E. Menchaca

Re:   Credit Agreement dated as of December 28, 2004, by and between F-W
OIL EXPLORATION L.L.C. and GUARANTY BANK, FSB, (as amended,
restated, or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement")

We have acted as counsel to F-W OIL EXPLORATION L.L.C. (the "Borrower") in
connection with the transactions contemplated in the Credit Agreement. This
Opinion is delivered pursuant to Section 3.1(m) of the Credit Agreement, and the
Lender is hereby authorized to rely upon this Opinion in connection with the
transactions contemplated in the Credit Agreement. Each capitalized term used
but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the
Credit Agreement.

In our representation of the Borrower, we have examined an executed
counterpart of each of the following (the "Loan Documents"):

(a) the Credit Agreement;

(b) the Note;

(c) Mortgage, Deed of Trust, Indenture, Security Agreement,
Assignment of Production, and Financing Statement dated of even date

to the Mortgage (the "Financing Statement").

(e) a certificate of incumbency dated the Closing Date, including

Borrower, such certificate being executed by the manager or another
authorized representative of the Borrower;

<PAGE>

(f) copies of resolutions, to the extent required under the
Operating Agreement of the Borrower, adopted by the board of directors of
the Borrower approving the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party
and authorizing the transactions contemplated herein and therein,
accompanied by a certificate dated the Closing Date issued by the manager
or another authorized representative of the Borrower to the effect that
such copies are true and correct copies of resolutions duly adopted and
that such resolutions constitute all the resolutions adopted with respect
to such transactions, have not been amended, modified, or rescinded in any
respect, and are in full force and effect as of the date of such
certificate;

(g) multiple counterparts, as requested by the Lender, of the
following Security Instruments creating, evidencing, perfecting, and
otherwise establishing Liens in favor of the Lender in and to the
Collateral:

(i) Ratification of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, Indenture,
Security Agreement, Assignment of Production, and Financing
Statement from the Borrower covering all Oil and Gas Properties of
the Borrower and all improvements, personal property, and fixtures
related thereto;

(ii) Financing Statements from the Borrower, as debtor,
constituent to the instrument described in clause (i) above;

(iii) undated letters, in form and substance satisfactory to
the Lender, from the Borrower to each purchaser of production and
disburser of the proceeds of production from or attributable to the
Mortgaged Properties, together with additional letters with the
addressees left blank, authorizing and directing the addressees to
make future payments attributable to production from the Mortgaged

<PAGE>

(h) certificates dated as of a recent date from the Secretary of
State or other appropriate Governmental Authority evidencing the existence
or qualification and good standing of the Borrower in its jurisdictions of
formation and in any other jurisdictions where it does business;

We have also examined the originals, or copies certified to our
satisfaction, of such other records of the Borrower, certificates of public
officials and officers of the Borrower, agreements, instruments, and documents
as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed.

In making such examinations, we have, with your permission, assumed:

(a) the genuineness of all signatures to the Loan Documents other
than those of the Borrower;

(b) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals
and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as
copies;

(c) the Lender is authorized and has the power to enter into and
perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement;

(d) the due authorization, execution, and delivery of all Loan
Documents by each party thereto other than the Borrower; and

(e) the Borrower has title to all Property covered or affected by
the Mortgage.

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth
herein, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Borrower is a corporation or limited liability companies duly
organized, legally existing, and in good standing under the laws of their
respective states of incorporation and are duly qualified as foreign
corporations or limited liability companies and are in good standing in
all jurisdictions wherein the ownership of their respective Property or
the operation of their respective businesses necessitates same.

2. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit
Agreement and the borrowings thereunder, the execution and delivery by the
Borrower of the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party, and
the payment and performance of all Obligations of the Borrower thereunder
are within the power of the Borrower, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and do not (a) require the consent of any
Governmental Authority, (b) contravene or conflict with any Requirement of
Law, (c) to our knowledge after due inquiry, contravene or conflict with
any indenture, instrument, or other agreement to which the Borrower is a
party or by which any Property of the Borrower may be presently bound or
encumbered, or (d) result in or require the creation or imposition of any
Lien upon any Property of the Borrower other than as contemplated by the
Loan Documents.

IV-iii
<PAGE>

3. The Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party constitute
legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against
the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

4. The forms of the Mortgage and the Financing Statement and the
description of the Mortgaged Property (as such term is defined in the
Mortgage and so used herein) situated in the State of Texas (the "State")
satisfy all applicable Requirements of Law of the State and are legally
sufficient under the laws of the State to enable the Lender to realize the
practical benefits purported to be afforded by the Mortgage.

5. The Mortgage creates a valid lien upon and security interest in
all Mortgaged Property situated in the State to secure the Indebtedness
(as such term is defined in the Mortgage and so used herein).

6. The Mortgage and the Financing Statement are in satisfactory form
for filing and recording in the offices described below.

7. The filing and/or recording, as the case may be, of (a) the
Mortgage in the office of the county clerk of each county in the State in
which any portion of the Mortgaged Property is located, and as a financing
statement and utility security instrument in the office of the Secretary
of State of the State, and (b) the Financing Statement in the Uniform
Commercial Code records in each county in the State in which any portion
of the Mortgaged Property is located are the only recordings or filings in
the State necessary to perfect the liens and security interests in the
Mortgaged Property created by the Mortgage or to permit the Lender to
enforce in the State its rights under the Mortgage. No subsequent filing,
re-filing, recording, or re-recording will be required in the State in
order to continue the perfection of the liens and security interests
created by the Mortgage except that (a) a continuation statement must be
filed with respect to the Mortgage filed as a financing statement in the
office of the Secretary of State of the State and with respect to the
Financing Statement in the Uniform Commercial Code records in each county
in the State in which any portion of the Mortgaged Property is located,
each within six months prior to the expiration of five years from the date
of the relevant initial financing statement filing, (b) a subsequent
continuation statement must be filed within six months prior to the
expiration of each subsequent five-year period from the date of each
initial financing statement filing, and (c) amendments or supplements to
the Mortgage filed as a financing statement and the Financing Statement
and/or additional financing statements may be required to be filed in the
event of a change in the name, identity, or structure of the Borrower or
in the event the financing statement filing otherwise becomes inaccurate
or incomplete.

8. To our knowledge after due inquiry, except as disclosed in
Exhibit VI to the Credit Agreement, no litigation or other action of any
nature affecting the Borrower is pending before any Governmental Authority
or threatened against the Borrower. To our knowledge after due inquiry, no
unusual or unduly burdensome restriction, restraint, or

hazard exists by contract, Requirement of Law, or otherwise relative to
the business or operations of the Borrower or the ownership and operation
of any Properties of the Borrower other than such as relate generally to
Persons engaged in business activities similar to those conducted by the
Borrower, as the case may be.

9. No authorization, consent, approval, exemption, franchise, permit
or license of, or filing (other than filing of Security Instruments in
appropriate filing offices) with, any Governmental Authority or any other
Person is required to authorize or is otherwise required in connection
with the valid execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan
Documents or any instrument contemplated thereby, or the payment
performance by the Borrower of the Obligations.

10. No transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents is in
violation of any regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, including, without limitation, Regulations G, T,
U, or X.

11. The Borrower is not, nor is the Borrower directly or indirectly
controlled by or acting on behalf of any Person which is, an "investment
company" or an "affiliated person" of an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

12. The Borrower is not a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a
"holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company,"
within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended.

The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following qualifications
and limitations:

A. We are licensed to practice law only in the State and other
jurisdictions whose laws are not applicable to the opinions expressed
herein; accordingly, the foregoing opinions are limited solely to the laws
of the State, applicable United States federal law.

law which limit the effect of waivers of rights by a debtor or grantor;
provided, however, that the limitations and other effects of such statutes
or rules of law upon the validity and binding effect of the Loan Documents
should not differ materially from the limitations and other effects of
such statutes or rules of law upon the validity and binding effect of
credit agreements, promissory notes, guaranties, and security instruments
generally.

under the Loan Documents is subject to general principles of equity

Term Lenders) and all other Obligations then due and owing to such Lenders under the Credit Agreement in their capacities as such and (iv) pay to each Existing Revolving Lender (including each Renewing Revolving Lender) all accrued and unpaid

Lender, a Tranche B Lender or a Revolving Lender, as the case may be, prior to the Refinancing Date, but that is not a New Lender.

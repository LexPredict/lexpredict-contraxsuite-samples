Loans”) to, and issue Letters of Credit for the account of, the Borrower, from time to time before the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided that, immediately after each Revolving Loan is made and Letter of Credit
issued, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans by the Bank and the face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit (whether or not drawn) shall not exceed the lesser of (i) $8,000,000 (as such figure may be reduced
from time to time as provided in this Agreement, the “Revolving Credit Commitment”), and (ii) the Borrowing Base. Subject to Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.1, repay or

Letter of Credit, (ii) the Bank must for any reason return or disgorge such reimbursement or (iii) the Borrower is required to make a payment under Section 2.1 hereof and fails to make such payment, then the amount of each
unreimbursed drawing under such Letter of Credit and payment required to be made under Section 2.1 hereof shall automatically be converted into an advance under the Revolving Credit Commitment which shall be made on the date of such
drawing for all purposes of this Agreement. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse the Bank with respect to each drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be absolute and unconditional.

7.2 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default:

(a) Acceleration of Indebtedness. The Bank may, in its sole discretion, (i) declare all or any part of a Loans immediately due
and payable, whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest, notice or legal process of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; provided, however,
that a Loan shall automatically become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Sections 7.1(h) or (j); (ii) pursue all other remedies available to it by contract, at law or in equity, including but not
limited to its rights under the Security Documents; (iii) cease to have any obligation to make the Loans or issue Letters of Credit, or to make any further disbursements hereunder; and (iv) require the Borrower to, and the Borrower shall

Letters of Credit plus all amounts paid by the Bank in connection with drawings under any Letter of Credit for which the Bank has not been reimbursed, and Borrower hereby pledges to the Bank, and grants to the Bank a security interest in, all such
cash as security for such obligations of Borrower.
(b) Right of Set-off. The Bank may, and is hereby authorized by the
Borrower, at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, without advance notice to the Borrower (any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower), set off and apply any and all deposits (general or

demand, provisional or final) at any time held and any other Indebtedness at any time owing by the Bank or
any of its Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any or all of the Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Credit Documents now or hereafter existing, whether or not such obligations have
matured. The Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off or application; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

(c) Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Non-Waiver; etc. The enumeration of the Bank’s rights and remedies set forth in this
Agreement is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise by the Bank of any right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies, all of which shall be cumulative, and shall be in addition to any other right or remedy
given hereunder, under the other Credit Documents or under any other agreement between the Borrower and the Bank or that may now or hereafter exist in law or in equity or by suit or otherwise. No delay or failure to take action on the part of the

or privilege or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default. No course of dealing between the Borrower and the Bank or their agents or employees shall be effective to change, modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any
of the other Credit Documents or to constitute a waiver of any Event of Default.

pertaining to any such Collateral or the use thereof, (e) any violation or alleged violation of any Environmental Law, federal or state securities law, common law, equitable requirement or other legal requirement by the Borrower or with respect
to any property owned, leased or operated by the Borrower (in the past, currently or in the future), or (f) any presence, generation, treatment, storage, disposal, transport, movement, release, suspected release or threatened release of any
Hazardous Material on, in, to or from any property (or any part thereof including without limitation the soil and groundwater thereon and thereunder) owned, leased or operated by the


28









Borrower (in the past, currently or in the future); provided, however, that such indemnity
shall not, as to any indemnified party, be available to the extent such liability results from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such indemnified party (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). All Costs shall be
additional Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, shall be payable on demand to the party to be indemnified, and shall be secured by the lien of the Security Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower shall be obligated to
pay, on demand, the costs of any investigation, monitoring, assessment, enforcement, removal, remediation, restoration or other response or corrective action undertaken by the Bank or any other indemnified party, or their respective agents, with

LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RELIEF AS IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE COURT. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE BANK TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE

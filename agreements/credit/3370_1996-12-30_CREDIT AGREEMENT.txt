2. THE CREDIT

2.1  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY LOANS.

(a)  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  Each Bank severally agrees, upon the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make loans to the Borrowers (the
"REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY LOANS") from time to time during the period beginning
on the date hereof and ending on December 15, 2001 or on the earlier date of
termination in full, pursuant to Section 2.9 or Section 6.2 hereof,

<PAGE>

of the obligations of such Bank under this Section 2.1(a) (December 15, 2001 or
such earlier date of termination being herein called the "REVOLVING CREDIT
FACILITY TERMINATION DATE") in amounts not to exceed at any time outstanding in
the aggregate the commitment amount set forth opposite the name of such Bank on
Exhibit B hereto under the caption "BANKS' COMMITMENTS AND PERCENTAGES" (each
such amount, as the same may be reduced pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof being
hereinafter called such Bank's "REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COMMITMENT"). (The
Banks' collective commitment to make Revolving Credit Facility Loans shall be
the "REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY").

The obligation of each Bank to make a Revolving Credit Facility Loan to the
Borrowers at any time shall be limited to the Bank's Commitment Percentage, as
defined on Exhibit B hereto under the caption "BANKS' COMMITMENTS AND
PERCENTAGES" (the "COMMITMENT PERCENTAGE") times the aggregate amount of the
Revolving Credit Facility Loans requested.  No Bank shall be required to make
any Revolving Credit Facility Loan if, immediately after giving effect to such
Revolving Credit Facility Loan and the application of the proceeds thereof to
the extent applied  to the repayment of Revolving Credit Facility Loans, (i) the
sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Bank's Revolving Credit
Facility Loans in U.S. Dollars outstanding, (b) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of
the aggregate principal amount of such Bank's  Revolving Credit Facility Loans
in a Selected Currency other than U.S. Dollars outstanding, (c) such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of Swingline Loans participated pursuant to Section
2.3(b)(3) and (d) such Bank's Commitment Percentage of Letter of Credit
Outstandings would exceed such Bank's Revolving Credit Facility Commitment, or
(ii) the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit
Facility Loans in U.S. Dollars outstanding, (b) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of
the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Facility Loans in a
Selected Currency other than U.S. Dollars outstanding, (c) the aggregate
principal amount of all Bid Loans outstanding, (d) the aggregate principal
amount of all Swingline Loans outstanding and (e) Letter of Credit Outstandings,
would exceed the Revolving Credit Facility.

The failure of any one or more of the Banks to make Revolving Credit
Facility Loans in accordance with its or their obligations shall not relieve the
other Banks of their several obligations hereunder, but in no event shall the
aggregate amount at any one time outstanding which any Bank shall be required to
lend under this Revolving Credit Facility exceed its Revolving Credit Facility
Commitment.

Within the limits of this Section 2.1(a) and subject to Section 2.11 below,
the Borrower may borrow, prepay pursuant to Section 2.10 and reborrow under this
Section 2.1(a).

(b)  SELECTED CURRENCY.  Subject to the provisions of this Article 2, each
Borrower shall have the right to receive the proceeds of Eurocurrency Rate
Borrowings in either U.S. Dollars or any other Selected Currency.  All Alternate
Base Rate Loans shall be made in U.S. Dollars.  The Selected Currency of
Eurocurrency Rate Borrowings sought by a Borrower shall be designated by the
Borrower in its Request for Advance for such Borrowing.  All Eurocurrency Rate
Loans to be made on the occasion of a particular Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing
shall be made in a single currency.


<PAGE>

(C)  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY NOTES.  The obligation of  Borrowers to
repay the Revolving Credit Facility Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced by a
separate promissory note issued by the Borrowers in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C-1 (the "REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY NOTES"). Each Revolving Credit
Facility Note shall be in a stated amount equal to the Revolving Credit Facility
Commitment of such Bank and each such Revolving Credit Facility Note shall bear
interest as provided herein and be payable at the times and in the manner herein
provided; provided, however, that notwithstanding the stated amount of such
Revolving Credit Facility Notes, the Borrowers' liability under the Revolving
Credit Facility Notes shall be limited at all times to the outstanding principal
amount of the Revolving Credit Facility Loans evidenced thereby (which principal
amount may be less than or may exceed the stated amount of such Revolving Credit
Facility Note), plus all interest accrued thereon and the amount of all costs
and expenses then payable thereunder, as established by each such Bank's books
and records, which books and records shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

2.2  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FUNDING PROCEDURES.

(A)  REQUEST FOR ADVANCES.  Revolving Credit Facility Loans to the
Borrowers on the occasion of each Borrowing shall be made pursuant to a written
request by the Borrowers therefor (a "REQUEST FOR ADVANCE"), delivered to the
Agent by 12:00 noon at least one Business Day, in the case of Alternate Base
Rate Loans, by 12:00 noon at least three London Business Days, in the case of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans for which the Selected Currency is U.S. Dollars, and by
9:30 a.m. at least three London Business Days in the case of Eurocurrency Rate
Loans for which  the Selected Currency is any currency other than U.S. dollars,
prior to the date on which such Loan is desired, stating:

(1)  the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day in the
case of an Alternate Base Rate Borrowing and shall be a London Business Day
in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing, the identities of the
Borrowers and the allocation of such Loans among the Borrowers;

(2)  the amount of such Borrowing by each Borrower, which on the date
of each Borrowing shall be (a) in the case of an Alternate Base Rate
Borrowing, U.S. $25,000,000 in the aggregate by all Borrowers or any larger
integral multiple of U.S. $1,000,000, and (b) in the case of a Eurocurrency
Borrowing, the amount of the Selected Currency with a U.S. Dollar
equivalent of U.S. $25,000,000 in the aggregate by all Borrowers or any
larger integral multiple of the amount of the Selected Currency with a U.S.
Dollar equivalent of U.S. $1,000,000;

(3)  whether the Revolving Credit Facility Loans comprising such
Borrowing are to be Alternate Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans;

<PAGE>

(4)  if the Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Loans,
the Selected Currency; and

(5)  the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject
to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

Each written Request for Advance shall be signed by an authorized officer of the
Company on behalf of the Borrowers and shall be for Revolving Credit Facility
Loans at a single interest rate option for all Borrowers.  No Request for
Advance shall become effective until actually received by the Agent.

(B)  ACTIONS BY AGENT.  Upon the Agent's receipt of any Request for
Advance, such Request for Advance shall not thereafter be revocable by the
Borrowers and the Agent shall promptly provide to each Bank such Request for
Advance and amount of the Revolving Credit Facility Loan to be made by such
Bank.  In addition, upon receipt of a Request for Advance in which the Borrowers
specify a Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing, the Agent shall inform each Bank of the
amount of the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan.

(C)  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.  Each Bank shall make available to the Agent
the amount of such Bank's Revolving Credit Facility Loan at the main office of
the Agent, or at such other office or account of the Agent as is designated in
writing by the Agent to the Bank, in immediately available funds no later than
12:00 noon, Philadelphia time, on the date of each Borrowing.  All such funds
shall be in U.S. Dollars, in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, and in the
applicable Selected Currency, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans.  On each
such Borrowing date, and subject to the prior receipt of funds from each Bank,
the Agent shall make available to the Borrowers in immediately available funds,
no later than 2:00 p.m., Philadelphia time, all of the proceeds of the Revolving
Credit Facility Loans to be made on such date upon satisfaction by the Borrowers
of all the applicable conditions specified in Article 4 hereof.

(D)  FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS.  Unless the Agent has been notified by any Bank
at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Revolving Credit Facility
Loan that such Bank does not intend to make available to the Agent such Bank's
portion of the total amount of the Loan to be made on such date, the Agent may
assume that each Bank has made the amount of such Bank's Revolving Credit
Facility Loan available to the Agent on the date for the Borrowing of such
Revolving Credit Facility Loan and the Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount.  If such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Agent by such Bank,
the Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from
such Bank, which demand shall be made in a reasonably prompt manner.  If such
Bank does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Agent's demand
therefor, the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Borrowers shall
pay such corresponding amount to the Agent.  The Agent shall also be entitled to
recover from such Bank or the Borrowers, as the case may be, interest on such
corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding
amount was made available by the Agent to the Borrowers to the date such
corresponding amount is recovered

<PAGE>

by the Agent at a rate equal to (i) if recovered from such Bank, the Federal
Funds Rate for three Business Days, and thereafter at the Alternative Base Rate
and (ii) if recovered from the Borrowers, the rate otherwise accruing on such
Revolving Credit Facility Loan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any
Bank of its obligation to fulfill its Commitment hereunder or to prejudice any
rights which any Borrower may have against any Bank as a result of any default
by such Bank hereunder.

(E)  MAXIMUM BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING. The Borrowers may not have more than
ten Borrowings outstanding at any one time.  For such purpose, one Borrowing by
one Borrower or Borrowings by more than one Borrower commenced on the same date
shall be deemed a single Borrowing.

2.3  SWINGLINE LOANS.

(A)  SWINGLINE FACILITY.  The Agent, in its individual capacity and under
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, shall provide
advances in U.S. Dollars (herein called "SWINGLINE LOANS"), to the Borrowers,
from time to time, as requested by the Company, provided that:

(1)  the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any one
time shall not exceed the least of (A) $25,000,000; and (B) such amount, if
any, as will, when added to the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount
of all Revolving Credit Facility Loans in U.S. Dollars outstanding, (b) the
U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving
Credit Facility Loans in a Selected Currency other than U.S. Dollars
outstanding, (c) the aggregate principal amount of all Bid Loans
outstanding, and (d) Letter of Credit Outstandings, would exceed the
Revolving Credit Facility; and

(2)  no Swingline Loan shall be outstanding for more than thirty (30)
calendar days.

(B)  FUNDING PROCEDURE.

(1)  The Company may request a Swingline Loan (on their own behalf or
on behalf of any Subsidiary Borrower) by delivering a Request For Swingline Loan
(in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, the "REQUEST FOR SWINGLINE LOAN")
signed by an authorized officer of the Company to the Agent on or before 12:00
noon Philadelphia time on the date the Swingline Loan is to be made. Upon
receipt of such Request For Swingline Loan and if the conditions provided herein
shall be satisfied at the time of such receipt, the Agent shall make the
Swingline Loan on the date specified therein.

(2)  Swingline Loans shall bear interest for any day at the Alternate
Base Rate or at an overnight money market rate determined by the Agent in good
faith if such rate is lower than

<PAGE>

the Alternate Base Rate.

(3)  The Agent may by written notice given to the Banks not later than
10:00 a.m. (Philadelphia time), on any Business Day require the Banks to acquire
participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans
outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans
in which Banks will participate, which participation will be based upon each
Bank's Commitment Percentage of the Swingline Loans to be participated. Each
Bank hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as
provided above, to pay to the Agent such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such
Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its obligation
to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance
whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default or
event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would constitute
an Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Facility
Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Bank shall comply with its
obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
in the same manner as provided in Section 2.2(c) with respect to Revolving
Credit Facility Loans made by such Bank. Any amounts received by the Agent from
a Borrower (or other party on behalf of a Borrower) in respect of a Swingline
Loan after receipt by the Agent of the proceeds of a sale of participations
therein shall be promptly remitted by the Agent to the Banks that shall have
made their payments pursuant to this paragraph, as their interests may appear.
The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph
shall not relieve the relevant Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

(4)  Within the foregoing limits, the Borrowers may request Swingline
Loans without regard to any minimum amount, repay them within thirty calendar
days and request new Swingline Loans. The Borrowers agree that the Swingline
Loans facility shall be used only for their convenience and need for very short
term funds. This facility shall not be used as a substitute for Loans by
continuously maintaining a significant dollar amount of Swingline Loans
outstanding.

(5)  All Swingline Loans shall, in any event, be repaid by the
Borrowers on the Revolving Credit Facility Termination Date.

(C)  SWINGLINE FACILITY NOTE.  At the signing of this Agreement, the
Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent a properly completed and duly executed
Swingline Facility Note substantially in the form of Exhibit C-3 hereto (the
"SWINGLINE FACILITY NOTE") which shall evidence the Swingline Loans made by the
Agent and be payable to the order of the Agent in the principal amount equal to
the $25,000,000; provided, however, that notwithstanding the stated amount of
such Swingline Facility Note, the Borrowers' liability under the Swingline
Facility Note shall be limited at all times to the outstanding principal amount
of the Swingline Facility evidenced thereby, plus all interest accrued thereon
and the amount of all costs and expenses then payable thereunder, as established
by the Agent's books and records.

2.4  LETTERS OF CREDIT.

(A)  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.

(1)  Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth,
the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, may request the Issuing Bank,
at any time and from time to time prior to the Revolving Credit Facility
Termination Date, to issue, and subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein the Issuing Bank shall issue, for the account of the Borrower, one or
more Letters of Credit in U.S. Dollars in such form as is approved by the
Issuing Bank in its sole discretion; provided, however, that no Letter of Credit
shall be issued if, upon such issuance, (A) all Letter of Credit Outstandings
would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit or (B) the sum of (a) the aggregate
principal amount of all Revolving Credit Facility Loans in U.S. Dollars
outstanding, (b) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
all Revolving Credit Facility Loans in a Selected Currency other than U.S.
Dollars outstanding, (c) the aggregate principal amount of all Bid Loans
outstanding, (d) the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Loans
outstanding and (e) Letter of Credit Outstandings, exceed the Revolving Credit
Facility.

(2)  No Letter of Credit shall bear an expiry date later than 365 days
from issuance, and no Letter of Credit issued less than 90 days prior to the
Revolving Credit Facility Termination Date shall bear an expiry date later than
90 days from issuance.

(B)  MINIMUM STATED AMOUNT.  The Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit
shall not be less than such amount as may be acceptable to the Issuing Bank.

(C)  LETTER OF CREDIT REQUESTS.

(1)  Whenever a Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for
its account, the Company shall give the Issuing Bank at least five Business
Days' prior written request therefor (or such shorter period of notice as the
Issuing Bank may agree upon with the Borrower from time to time).

(2)  The execution and delivery of each request for a Letter of Credit
shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Borrowers that such
Letter of Credit may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the
requirements of, this Section 2.4.  Unless the Issuing Bank has received notice
from the Agent or the Majority Banks before it issues the respective Letter of
Credit that one or more of the conditions specified in Section 4.2 are not then
satisfied, or that the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate Section
2.4, then the Issuing Bank may issue the requested Letter of Credit for the
account of the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, with
respect to any matters not specifically covered by this Agreement, in accordance
with the Issuing Bank's usual and customary practices and any Letter of Credit
Agreement in effect with such Borrower.  In the event that any conflict shall
exist between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any such Letter of
Credit Agreement, the terms of this

<PAGE>

Agreement shall prevail.

(D)  LETTER OF CREDIT PARTICIPATIONS.

(1)  Immediately upon the issuance by the Issuing Bank of any Letter
of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each
Bank (other than the Issuing Bank), and each such Bank shall be deemed
irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from the Issuing
Bank, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation, to
the extent of such Bank's Commitment Percentage, in such Letter of Credit, each
substitute letter of credit, each drawing made thereunder and the obligations of
the Borrowers under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security
therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the Revolving Credit
Facility Commitments of the Banks, it is hereby agreed that, with respect to all
outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid Drawings (as defined in Section 2.4(e)
hereof), there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant
to this Section 2.4(d) to reflect the new Revolving Credit Facility Commitment
Percentages of the assigning and assignee Banks.

(2)  In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank shall have no obligation relative to the Banks other than to
confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit
appear to have been delivered and that they appear to comply on their face with
the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit if
taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct, shall
not create for the Issuing Bank any resulting liability to any Bank.

(3)  In the event that the Issuing Bank makes any payment under any
Letter of Credit and the Borrowers shall not have reimbursed such amount in full
in cash to the Issuing Bank pursuant to and as required by Section 2.4(e), the
Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent, which shall promptly notify each
Bank of such failure, and each Bank shall promptly and unconditionally pay to
the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, the amount of such Bank's
Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in U.S. Dollars and in same
day funds. If the Agent so notifies, prior to 11:00 A.M. (Philadelphia time) on
any Business Day, any Bank required to fund a payment under a Letter of Credit,
such Bank shall make its required payment on the same Business Day. If and to
the extent such Bank shall not have so made its Commitment Percentage of the
amount of such payment available to the Agent for the account of the Issuing
Bank, such Bank agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank,
forthwith on demand, such amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal
Funds Rate, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to
the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank. The failure of any Bank to make
available to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank its Commitment
Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit shall not relieve any other
Bank of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Agent for the account
of the Issuing Bank its Commitment Percentage of any payment under any Letter of
Credit on the date required, as specified

<PAGE>

above; but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to
make available to the Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank such other
Bank's Commitment Percentage of any such payment.

(4)  Whenever the Issuing Bank receives a payment of a reimbursement
obligation as to which the Agent has received for the account of the Issuing
Bank any payments from the Banks pursuant to clause (3) above, the Issuing Bank
shall pay to the Agent and the Agent shall promptly pay to each Bank which has
paid its Commitment Percentage thereof, in U.S. Dollars and in same day funds,
an amount equal to such Bank's Commitment Percentage thereof.

(5)  Upon the request of any Bank, the Issuing Bank shall furnish to
such Bank copies of any Letter of Credit to which the Issuing Bank is party and
such other documentation relating to such Letter of Credit as may reasonably be
requested by such Bank.

(6)  As between the Borrowers on the one hand and the Issuing Bank and
the Banks on the other hand, the Borrowers assume all risks of the acts and
omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by the respective beneficiaries
of such Letters of Credit. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither the Issuing Bank nor any other Bank shall be responsible (except in the
case of its gross negligence or willful misconduct) for the following:

(A)  the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
legal effect of any documents submitted by any party in connection with the
application for and issuance of or any drawing under such Letters of
Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any respects invalid,
insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged;

(B)  the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring
or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit
or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason;

(C)  failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to
comply fully with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of
Credit, other than material conditions or instructions that expressly
appear in such Letter of Credit;

(D)  errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in the
transmission or delivery of any messages by mail, cable,, telecopier, telex
or otherwise, whether or not they are encoded;

(E)  errors in interpretation of technical terms;

(F)  any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any

<PAGE>

document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of
Credit or the proceeds thereof;

(G)  the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of
Credit of the proceeds of any drawing of any such Letter of Credit; and

(H)  any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of
the Issuing Bank, including without limitation any acts of governments.

(7)  The obligations of the Borrowers to make payments to the Agent
for the account of the Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit shall be
irrevocable and not subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever and
shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following
circumstances:

(A)  any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents;

(B)  the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
which any Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a
Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for
whom any such transferee may be acting), the Agent, the Issuing Bank, any
Bank, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any
Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated
transactions;

(C)  any draft, certificate or any other document presented under
the Letter of Credit shall prove to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
insufficient in any respect or any statement therein shall prove to be
untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

(D)  the surrender or impairment of any security for the
performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents;

(E)  the occurrence of any Event of Default or event which, with
giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of
Default; or

(F)  the termination of this Agreement or any Revolving Credit
Facility Commitment (but only with respect to Letters of Credit issued
prior to such termination).

(8)  Immediately upon the issuance by the applicable Issuing Bank of
any Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank will provide to each other Bank a copy
of the Borrower's written request therefor. In addition, promptly upon receipt
by the applicable Issuing Bank of fees payable

<PAGE>

with respect to a Letter of Credit, such Issuing Bank will pay to the Agent for
distribution to each of the Banks (including such Issuing Bank) the Letter of
Credit Fee, and shall pay to the Issuing Bank such fronting fee and customary
charges as shall be agreed by the Company and the Issuing Bank.

(E)  AGREEMENT TO REPAY LETTER OF CREDIT DRAWINGS

(1)  Each Borrower agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank, in U.S.
Dollars and in immediately available funds, for any payment made by the Issuing
Bank under any Letter of Credit issued at the request of such Borrower (each
such amount so paid until reimbursed, an "UNPAID DRAWING") immediately after,
and in any event on the date of, such payment, with interest on the amount so
paid by the Issuing Bank, to the extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00 p.m.
(Philadelphia time) on the date of such payment, from and including the date
paid to but excluding the date reimbursement is made as provided above, at a
rate per annum equal to the Alternative Base Rate plus 200 basis points, such
interest to be payable promptly following demand.

(2)  The obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.4(e) to
reimburse the Issuing Bank with respect to Unpaid Drawings (including, in each
case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment
which any Borrower may have or have had against any Bank (including in its
capacity as the Issuing Bank or as a participant in any Letter of Credit),
including, without limitation, any defense based upon any non-application or
misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of any drawing under a Letter
of Credit (each, a "DRAWING"); provided, however, that no Borrower shall be
obligated to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any wrongful payment made by the
Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions
constituting wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Issuing
Bank.

(3)  On the Revolving Credit Facility Termination Date, the Borrowers
shall deliver to the Agent cash or U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities of not
more than ninety (90) days from the date of delivery (discounted in accordance
with customary banking practice to present value to determine amount) in an
amount equal at all times to one hundred five percent (105%) of the Letter of
Credit Outstandings, such cash or U.S. Treasury Bills and all interest earned
thereon to constitute cash collateral for the Borrowers' reimbursement
obligation with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding on the Revolving
Credit Facility Termination Date. If such cash collateral or U.S. Treasury Bills
has not been deposited within five (5) days after the date required, one or more
of the Banks shall be entitled to charge any account maintained by any Borrower
with such Bank or Banks to the extent necessary to create such cash collateral.
Any cash collateral deposited under this paragraph, and all interest earned
thereon, shall be held by the Agent and invested and reinvested at the expense
and the written direction of the Company, in U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities
of no more than ninety (90) days from the date of investment.

remit such payments to the Bid Loan Lender.

(3)  All Bid Loans shall, in any event, be repaid by the Borrowers on
the Revolving Credit Facility Termination Date.

(B)  BID LOAN NOTES.  At the signing of this Agreement, the Borrowers shall
deliver to each Bank a properly completed and duly executed Bid Loan Note
substantially in the form of Exhibit C-2 hereto (the "BID LOAN NOTES") which
shall evidence the Bid Loans made by such Bank and be payable to the order of
such Bank in the principal amount equal to the Revolving Credit Facility;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the stated amount of such Bid Loan
Notes, the Borrowers' liability under the Bid Loan Notes shall be limited at all
times to the outstanding principal amount of the Bid Loans evidenced thereby,
plus all interest accrued thereon and the

-20
<PAGE>

amount of all costs and expenses then payable thereunder, as established by each
such Bank's books and records.

(c)  PROCEDURE FOR BID BORROWINGS.

(1)  When the Company wishes to request offers to make Bid Loans
hereunder, it shall notify the Agent by FAX of a notice in substantially the
form of Exhibit F-1 (a "COMPETITIVE BID REQUEST") no later than 9:00 a.m.
(Philadelphia time), two Business Days prior to the proposed Bid Loan Borrowing
Date of a Bid Borrowing, specifying: (i) the date of such Bid Borrowing, which
shall be a Business Day; (ii) the aggregate amount of such Bid Borrowing, which
shall be a minimum amount of $10,000,000 or in any integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof; (iii) the Bid Loan Duration applicable thereto;
(iv) the Borrower requesting such Bid Loan; and (v) the Company's account to
which the proceeds of the Bid Loan should be credited. The Company may neither
request Competitive Bids for more than two Bid Loan Durations in a single
Competitive Bid Request nor request Competitive Bids more frequently than once
every three Business Days.

(2)  Upon receipt of a Competitive Bid Request, the Agent will
promptly notify each Bank by FAX of the Competitive Bid Request. Such
notification shall constitute an invitation by the Company to each Bank to
submit Competitive Bids to make the Bid Loans to which such Competitive Bid
Request relates in accordance with this Section 2.5(c).

(3)  Each Bank may at its sole discretion submit a bid ("COMPETITIVE
BID") containing an offer or offers to make Bid Loans in response to any
Competitive Bid Request. Each Competitive Bid must comply with the requirements
of this Section 2.5(c)(3) and must be submitted to the Agent (which may be by
FAX) at the Agent's office set forth on the signature page hereto not later than
9:45 a.m. (Philadelphia time) on the proposed Bid Loan Borrowing Date; provided
that Competitive Bids submitted by the Agent (or any Affiliate of the Agent) may
only be submitted if the Agent or such Affiliate notifies the Company of the
terms of its Competitive Bid not later than 9:30 a.m. (Philadelphia time) on the
proposed Bid Loan Borrowing Date.

Each Competitive Bid shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit F-
2, specifying therein:

(i)    the proposed Bid Loan Borrowing Date;

(ii)   the principal amount of each Bid Loan for which such
Competitive Bid is being made, which principal amount (x) may be equal
to, greater than or less than the Revolving Credit Facility Commitment
of the quoting Bank, (y) must be $1,000,000 or in multiples of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (z) may not exceed the principal
amount of the Bid Loan for which Competitive Bids were requested;

<PAGE>

(iii)  the Absolute Rate offered for each such Bid Loan and the
Bid Loan Duration applicable thereto; and

(iv)   the identity of the quoting Bank.

A Competitive Bid may contain separate offers by the quoting Bank with respect
to each Bid Loan Duration specified in the related Competitive Bid Request.

Any Competitive Bid shall be disregarded if it:

(i)    is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit F-2 or
does not specify all of the information required by this Section 2.5;

(ii)   contains qualifying, conditional or similar language;

(iii)  proposes terms other than or in addition to those set
forth in the applicable Competitive Bid Request; or

(iv)   arrives after the time set forth in this Section 2.5.

(4)  Promptly on receipt and not later than 10:00 a.m. (Philadelphia
time) on the proposed Bid Loan Borrowing Date, the Agent will notify the Company
by telephone (confirmed the same day by FAX) of the terms (i) of any Competitive
Bid submitted by a Bank that is in accordance with Section 2.5, and (ii) of any
Competitive Bid that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a
previous Competitive Bid submitted by such Bank with respect to the same
Competitive Bid Request. Any such subsequent Competitive Bid shall be
disregarded by the Agent unless such subsequent Competitive Bid is submitted
solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive Bid and only if
received within the times set forth in this Section 2.5. The Agent's notice to
the Company shall specify (1) the aggregate principal amount of Bid Loans for
which offers have been received for each Bid Loan Duration specified in the
related Competitive Bid Request; and (2) the respective principal so offered and
the Bid Loan Durations applicable thereto. Subject only to the provisions of
this subsection (4), any Competitive Bid shall be irrevocable except with the
written consent of the Company.

(5)  Not later than 10:15 a.m. (Philadelphia time) on the proposed Bid
Loan Borrowing Date, the Company shall notify the Agent of its acceptance or
non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to this Section 2.5 by
telephone, such verbal notice to be confirmed the same day by FAX of a written
notice substantially in the form of Exhibit F-3 hereto (the "BID LOAN NOTICE"),
which notice shall set forth the amounts, interest rates, dates of borrowings
and maturities of each Bid Loan comprising such Borrowing and of the Banks
making such Loans. The Company shall be under no obligation to accept any offer
and may choose to reject all offers. The Company's failure to accept an offer in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5 shall

<PAGE>

constitute the Company's rejection of such offer. In the case of acceptance,
such notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Bid
Loan Duration that is accepted. The Company may accept any Competitive Bid in
whole or in part; provided that:

(i)    the aggregate principal amount of each Bid Borrowing may
not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Competitive
Bid Request;

(ii)   each Bid Loan must be in a minimum principal amount of
$10,000,000 or in any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,
provided that all Bid Loans made on the same day for the same duration
shall be deemed to be one (1) Bid Loan;

(iii)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of
ascending Absolute Rates within each Bid Loan Duration; and

(iv)   the Company may not accept any offer that is required to
be disregarded pursuant to this Section 2.5(c) or that otherwise fails
to comply with the requirements of this Agreement.

(6)    If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same
Absolute Rates for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in
respect of which such offers are accepted for the related Bid Loan Duration, the
principal amount of Bid Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall
be allocated by the Company in consultation with the Agent among such Banks as
nearly as possible (in such multiples as the Company in consultation with the
Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of
such offers. Determination by the Company in consultation with the Agent of the
amounts of Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(7)    Promptly upon receipt of notice from the Company in
accordance with Section 2.5(c)(5), the Agent shall notify each Bank having
submitted a Competitive Bid whether or not its offer has been accepted and, if
its offer has been accepted, of the amount of the Bid Loan or Bid Loans to be
made by it on the Bid Loan Borrowing Date. Promptly following each Bid
Borrowing, the Agent shall notify each Bank that submitted a Competitive Bid
(and each other Bank that so requests) of the ranges of the bids submitted and
the highest and lowest bids accepted for each Bid Loan Duration requested by the
Company and the aggregate amount borrowed pursuant to such Bid Borrowing.

(8)    On the Bid Loan Borrowing Date, upon satisfaction of all
applicable conditions specified in Article 3 hereof, each Bank whose Competitive
Bid was accepted by the Company shall make the proceeds of its Bid Loan
available to the Agent by 1:00 p.m. (Philadelphia

<PAGE>

time) at the address set forth opposite its name on the signature page hereof or
at such office or account as the Agent shall specify to the Banks. The Agent
will make the funds so received from the Banks available not later than 3:00
p.m. (Philadelphia time) to the Company on the Bid Loan Borrowing Date by a
credit to the account of the Company set forth in the Bid Loan Notice.

2.6  JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS.

(a)  Each Borrower (including without limitation the Company) shall bear
liability under the Notes and Letter of Credit Outstandings for all amounts as
aforesaid jointly and severally with each other Borrower and whether or not such
Borrower is designated in any Request for Advance as the Borrower requesting any
Loans, it having been determined by each Borrower that it will benefit from the
availability of credit to all Borrowers under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall
be liable for the obligations of any other Borrower hereunder, and each Foreign
Subsidiary Borrower shall be liable solely for the Loans where it is designated
as Borrower, for Letters of Credit issued to it, and for its pro rata share of
all fees and expenses and other sums due hereunder (other than principal and
interest on the Loans) based upon the ratio of Loans and Letters of Credit
outstanding to such Borrower to the total amount of Loans outstanding and Letter
of Credit Outstandings hereunder.

(b)  The liability of each Borrower under this Agreement and each Note for
any and all obligations of the Borrowers, individually and collectively, owed to
the Banks under this Agreement and each Note shall be unconditional and absolute
irrespective of (a) any lack of enforceability of any obligation, (b) any change
of the time, manner, place of payment, or any other term of any obligation, (c)
any law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction affecting the genuineness,
validity, or rights of the Banks, individually and collectively, with respect to
any obligation or any instrument evidencing any obligation, or (d) any other
circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense to or discharge of any
Borrower, including, without limitation, the release of any other Borrower from
such obligations.  Each Borrower agrees that its obligations hereunder are
irrevocable; that a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted
against it or other remedies hereunder may be sought regardless of whether any
other Borrower is joined in any such action or actions or subject to enforcement
of any such remedies; and that it waives the benefit of any statute of
limitations affecting its liabilities hereunder and each Note or the enforcement
hereof or thereof if the action otherwise barred by such statute of limitations
is brought against any other Borrower within such statute of limitations. Each
Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any right of subrogation or contribution it
may have against any other Borrower for amounts paid hereunder.

2.7  INTEREST RATES.

(A)  ALTERNATE BASE RATE LOANS.  Each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the unpaid principal balance thereof from day to day at a rate per
annum which at all times shall be equal to the Alternate Base Rate.  Any change
in such interest rate due to a change in the Alternate Base Rate shall be
effective on the date of such change.  Interest on an Alternate Base Rate Loan

<PAGE>

shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable
quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December
after the date hereof and at maturity of the applicable Interest Period, subject
to the Company's prepayment option set forth at Section 2.10 hereof.

(B)  EUROCURRENCY RATE LOANS.   Each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear
interest from its date on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per
annum equal to the LIBO Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  Interest on each
Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
shall be payable at the maturity thereof, except that interest on each
Eurocurrency Rate Loan having a maturity of more than three months shall be
payable at intervals of three months after the date of such Loan and at maturity
of the applicable Interest Period, subject to the Company's prepayment option
set forth at Section 2.10 hereof.

The Agent shall give prompt notice by FAX to the Company and to each of the
Banks of the LIBO Rate determined in respect of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan and
of any change therein.  If the Agent shall not so notify the Company and each
Bank of a rate, or if otherwise the Agent shall determine (which determination
shall be, in the absence of fraud or manifest error, conclusive and binding upon
all parties hereto) that by reason of abnormal circumstances affecting the
interbank eurodollar or applicable eurocurrency market, adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate to be applicable to the
requested Eurocurrency Rate Loan or that applicable funds in amounts sufficient
to fund such Eurocurrency Rate Loan are not obtainable on reasonable terms, the
Agent shall give notice of such inability or determination by FAX to the Company
and to each of the Banks at least one Business Day prior to the date of the
proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan and thereupon the obligations of the Banks to
make such Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be excused, subject, however, to the
right of the Company at any time thereafter to submit another such request.

(C)  POST MATURITY RATE.  After maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) each Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 3% in
excess of the rate otherwise in effect from time to time thereafter, from the
date when due, until such Loan is fully paid, which interest shall be payable by
the Borrowers on demand.

2.8  FEES.

(A)  FACILITY FEE.  The Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent in U.S.
Dollars, for the account of each Bank, an annual facility fee (the "FACILITY
FEE") computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, in amounts equal to the then
Applicable Rate of such Bank's Revolving Credit Facility Commitment.  The
Facility Fee shall be payable in arrears in quarterly installments on the last
Business Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Revolving
Credit Facility Termination Date.

<PAGE>

(B)  LETTER OF CREDIT FEE.   The Borrowers agree to pay the Agent in U.S.
Dollars, a Letter of Credit fee (the "LETTER OF CREDIT FEE"), computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days, in an amount equal to the then Applicable Rate
multiplied by the Stated Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, which
Letter of Credit Fee shall be distributed by the Agent to the Banks in
accordance with their respective Commitment Percentage.  The Letter of Credit
Fee shall be payable in arrears in quarterly installments on the last Business
Day of each March, June, September and December and on the Revolving Credit
Facility Termination Date.

(C)  BID LOAN FEE

The Borrowers will pay to the Agent a fee as agreed upon between the
Company and the Agent (the "BID LOAN FEE") due the Agent in connection with the
Competitive Bid Request, such fee to be due and payable on the date of each
Competitive Bid Request.

2.9  TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF CREDIT; RECOMPUTATION DATE.

(A)  TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF CREDIT.  The Borrowers shall have the
right at any time and from time to time, upon five Business Days' written notice
to the Agent (which shall promptly relay such notice to the other Banks), to
terminate in whole or reduce in part, in each case permanently but without
premium or penalty, the Revolving Credit Facility, provided that each such
partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of U.S. $25,000,000 or an
integral multiple thereof, and provided that each Bank's Commitment shall be
reduced pro rata in proportion to its Commitment Percentage.

(B)  REDUCTION.  In the event the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced, the
Borrowers shall, simultaneously with such reduction, make a prepayment of
principal and interest in respect of the Alternate Base Rate Loans borrowed
under such Facility in such amount as is necessary to assure that the aggregate
principal amount of Loans outstanding and Letter of Credit Outstandings under
such Facility immediately after such reduction will not exceed the Revolving
Credit Facility as reduced.  If prepayment in full of the Alternative Base Rate
Loans does not reduce the amount of all Loans outstanding and Letter of Credit
Outstandings under such Facility to an amount that will not exceed the Revolving
Credit Facility as reduced, the Borrowers shall deposit with the Agent cash in
an amount sufficient to repay that portion of the principal amount of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans outstanding, with interest thereon through the end of
each applicable Interest Period, as is necessary to assure that the aggregate
principal amount of Loans and Letters of Credit outstanding under such Facility
immediately after such reduction less the principal amount of Eurocurrency Rate
Loans under each Facility repaid by such deposit will not exceed the Revolving
Credit Facility as reduced, such deposit to be held by the Agent on behalf of
the Banks until the maturity date of such Loans and then applied to the
repayment of such Loans. If prepayment in full of the Alternative Base Rate
Loans and Eurocurrency Rate Loans does not reduce the amount of all Loans
outstanding and Letter of Credit Outstandings under such Facility to an amount
that will not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility as reduced, the Borrowers
shall deposit with the Agent cash in an amount sufficient to repay

<PAGE>

that portion of the principal amount of Bid Loans outstanding, with interest
thereon through the end of each applicable Interest Period, as is necessary to
assure that the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding and Letter of
Credit Outstandings under such Facility immediately after such reduction less
the principal amount of Bid Loans under each Facility repaid by such deposit
will not exceed the Revolving Credit Facility as reduced, such deposit to be
held by the Agent on behalf of the Banks until the maturity date of such Loans
and then applied to the repayment of such Loans. Interest on amounts so held by
the Agent shall accrue at the Federal Funds Rate and shall be paid to each Bank
in accordance with their Commitment Percentage.

(C)  RECOMPUTATION DATE.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, if there are any Eurocurrency Rate Loans outstanding
the Selected Currency of which is not U.S. Dollars, the Agent shall recompute,
on and as of the last day of each calendar quarter and on the date of the
reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility (each such date, a "RECOMPUTATION
DATE"), the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of such Eurocurrency Rate Loans.  If pursuant
to such recomputations the Agent determines that the aggregate principal amount
of Revolving Credit Facility Loans when added to (a) the aggregate principal
amount of all Bid Loans outstanding, (b) the aggregate principal amount of all
Swingline Loans and (c) Letter of Credit Outstandings is greater than 105% of
the Revolving Credit Facility, as then in effect, the Agent shall so advise the
Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall prepay the amount in excess of 100% of the
Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest on the amount so
prepaid within five Business Days of receipt of such notice from the Agent.

(d)  If the Borrower prepays any Eurocurrency Rate Loan pursuant to this
Section 2.9, simultaneously with such prepayment the Borrower shall pay the
applicable Bank or Banks pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof all funding costs and
loss of earnings which may arise in connection with such prepayment as
determined by each such Bank in good faith.  The Agent shall promptly notify
each Bank of each such prepayment of Loans.

2.10 OPTIONAL LOAN PREPAYMENTS.  Any Borrower, upon two Business Days'
written notice to the Agent (which shall promptly relay such notice to the other
Banks), may prepay one or more Loans as such Borrower shall designate in such
notice, in whole at any time or in part from time to time without premium or
penalty but with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the
principal amount being prepaid, provided that (a) each such partial prepayment
shall be in the aggregate principal amount of (i) U.S. $10,000,000 plus
integrals of U.S. $1,000,000, if U.S. Dollar Loans are to be prepaid, and (ii)
at least $10,000,000 in U.S. Dollar Equivalent plus integrals of $1,000,000 in
U.S. Dollars Equivalents, if Eurocurrency Rate Loans are to be prepaid, and
shall be applied as among the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective
Commitments or, if such payment relates to a Bid Loan or Swingline Loan, based
upon the proportion of such Bid Loan or Swingline Loan made by or participated
to such Bank, (b) the Borrower shall specify the date, type and amount of each
Loan being prepaid and (c) if such prepayment applies to Eurocurrency Rate
Loans, simultaneously with such prepayment the Borrower shall pay the applicable
Bank or Banks pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof all funding costs and loss of
earnings which may arise in connection

<PAGE>

with such prepayment as determined by each such Bank in good faith. The Agent
shall promptly notify each Bank of each such prepayment of Loans.

2.11 PAYMENTS.

(A)  All payments (including  prepayments) to a Bank of the principal of or
interest on any Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be made in the Selected Currency of
such Loan, and all other payments hereunder, including in respect of any Fee and
all payments (including prepayments) to a Bank of the principal of or interest
on any U.S. Dollar Loan shall be made in U.S. Dollars.  All payments (including
prepayments) to a Bank of the principal of or interest on any Loan or in respect
of any Fee shall be remitted for the account of such Bank to the Agent at the
main office of the Agent, or at such office or account in London as the Agent
shall specify to the Banks and the Borrowers with respect to Loans denominated
in a Selected Currency other than U.S. Dollars, not later than 11 a.m.
Philadelphia time or London time, as applicable, on the due date thereof in
immediately available funds.

(B)  Each such payment for the account of a Bank shall be made absolutely
net of, without deduction or offset for and altogether free and clear of any and
all present and future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges and
withholdings and all liabilities with respect thereto under the laws of the
United States or any foreign jurisdiction (or any state, county, or political
subdivision thereof), excluding income and franchise taxes imposed on such Bank
under the laws of the United States or any foreign jurisdiction (or any state,
county or political subdivision thereof).  If a Borrower is compelled by law to
deduct any such taxes (other than such excluded taxes) or to make any such other
deductions or withholdings, it will pay such additional amounts as may be
necessary in order that the net payments after such deduction, and after giving
effect to any income taxes under the laws of the United States or any foreign
jurisdiction (or any state, county or political subdivision thereof) required to
be paid by any Bank in respect of such additional amounts, shall equal the
amount provided for herein or in any Note.

(C)  Any payments to a Bank of the principal or interest due under any
Alternate Base Rate Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan or in respect of the Fee,
shall be made simultaneously with corresponding payments for the respective
accounts of the other Banks.  All such simultaneous payments shall, as among the
Banks, be in amounts pro rata in accordance with their respective Commitment
Percentages.  Payments received by the Agent shall be applied in accordance with
Section 9.8.

(D)  Each Revolving Credit Facility Loan shall mature on the earlier of the
last day of the applicable Interest Period therefor and Revolving Credit
Facility Termination Date.

(E)  If the Banks make a Loan on a day on which all or any part of
outstanding Loans from the Banks denominated in the same Selected Currency are
to be repaid, each Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such
repayment and only an amount equal to the difference

<PAGE>

(if any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be
made available by such Bank to the Agent and by the Agent to the Borrowers.

2.12 ILLEGALITY.  Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any
requirement of law, regulation, order or decree of any jurisdiction applicable
to any Bank (including the United States, the United Kingdom or any state,
county or political subdivision thereof) or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Bank to
make or maintain certain or all of the Loans contemplated by this Agreement,
such Bank shall so notify the Agent and the Borrowers and the Agent shall
forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks.  Upon the giving of any such
notice to the Agent and the Borrowers (a) such Bank shall no longer be obligated
to make those types of Loans determined by such Bank to be unlawful and (b) the
Borrowers shall prepay in full such Loans made by such Bank then outstanding,
together with accrued interest thereon and any other amounts which may be due to
such Bank under this Agreement (including, without limitation, amounts owing to
such Bank pursuant to Sections 2.13 and 2.14) on the earlier of (i) the last day
of the then current Interest Period applicable to each Loan of such Bank or (ii)
on the date after which such Bank may no longer lawfully continue to maintain
and fund such Loans.  If a circumstance of the type described in this Section
2.12 occurs, the Banks agree to negotiate in good faith with the Borrowers to
amend this Agreement to provide Loans hereunder which will not be unlawful.  In
addition, as soon as practicable after the Agent or any Bank obtains knowledge
of any event which will cause, or is likely to cause, a circumstance of the type
described in this Section 2.12, the Agent or the Bank, as the case may be, shall
notify the Borrowers thereof and each affected Bank shall designate a different
lending office for its Loans or take such other action to avoid the need for
repayment of its Loans pursuant to this Section 2.12 to the extent that such a
designation or the taking of such action would not, in the reasonable opinion of
such Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank.

2.13 INCREASED COST.

(a)  If Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time, or any
other requirement of law or regulation applicable to any Bank, including,
without limitation, the United States or the United Kingdom or any state, county
or political subdivision thereof, or any order or decree or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by a Bank with any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) occurring after the date
hereof from any central bank or monetary authority or other governmental
authority:

(1)  does or shall subject such Bank to any tax of any kind whatsoever
with respect to this Agreement or any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or change the
basis of taxation of payments to such Bank of principal, Facility Fees,
interest or other amount payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate
of tax on general income and similar taxes on the overall net income of
such Bank in any jurisdiction); or

<PAGE>

(2)  does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable or change any
reserve, special deposit, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premium,
compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits
or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or
other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office
of such Bank which are not otherwise included in the determination of the
LIBO Rate hereunder; or

(3)  does or shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank of
making, renewing, converting or maintaining advances or extensions of credit as
Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable in respect of such
Eurocurrency Rate Loans then, in any such case, the Borrowers shall promptly pay
to such Bank such additional amount which will compensate the Bank for such
additional cost or reduced amount receivable which the Bank deems to be material
as determined by the Bank with respect to this Agreement or the Eurocurrency
Rate Loans hereunder.

(b)  If any Bank shall have determined that compliance by such Bank with
any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation or order of any jurisdiction
applicable to such Bank (including, without limitation, the United States or the
United Kingdom or any state, county or political subdivision thereof) regarding
capital adequacy of banks or bank holding companies, or any interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by such Bank with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether
or not having the force of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith
would be unlawful) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's capital
as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Bank could have achieved but for such compliance (taking into
consideration such Bank's policies with respect to capital adequacy immediately
before such compliance and assuming that such Bank's capital was fully utilized
prior to such compliance) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then,
upon demand, the Borrowers shall immediately pay to such Banks as are so
affected such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Banks
for such reduced return, together with interest on each such amount from four
Business Days after the date demanded until payment in full thereof at the rate
of interest of 3% per annum over the Alternate Base Rate.  In determining such
amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  No
liability or cost pursuant to this Section 2.13(b) shall be incurred by the
Borrowers prior to, or relating to any period before, the date that the
Borrowers receive a demand from a Bank under this Section 2.13(b).

(c)  If a Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to
this Section 2.13, it shall promptly notify the Borrowers thereof.  A
certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing
submitted by a Bank to the Borrowers shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.  For purposes of the application of this Section 2.13, and in
calculating the amount

<PAGE>

necessary to compensate such Bank for any imposition of or increase in capital
requirements or taxes hereunder, such Bank shall determine the applicability of
this provision and calculate the amount payable to it hereunder in a manner
consistent with the manner in which it shall apply and calculate similar
compensation payable to it by other borrowers having provisions in their credit
agreements comparable to this Section 2.13.

(d)  If any Bank shall, at any time, incur costs associated with reserve
requirements pursuant to Regulation D in connection with the making or
maintenance of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan, then the Borrowers shall immediately
pay such costs to such Bank in accordance with Section 2.13(c) hereof.

2.14 INDEMNITY AGAINST FUNDING LOSSES OR EXPENSES.  The Borrowers shall
indemnify each Bank against any loss, funding cost, expense or loss of earnings,
which such Bank may, as a consequence of the Borrowers' failure to accept Loans
requested at any time, failure to make a payment on the due date thereof or the
payment, prepayment or conversion of any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Bid Loans on
a day other than the maturity date thereof, reasonably sustain or reasonably
incur in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties acquired to
effect, fund or maintain such or any part thereof.  If a Bank becomes entitled
to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly
notify the Agent, which shall promptly notify the Borrowers thereof.

2.15 SUBSTITUTION OF BANK.  If any Bank has demanded compensation under
Section 2.13 or Section 2.14, the Borrowers shall have the right, after
consultation with the Agent, to seek a substitute bank or banks (which may be
one or more of the Banks) to purchase the Notes for cash without recourse to
such Bank and assume the Commitment of such Bank, which shall thereupon be
released from all of its obligations hereunder.

3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Borrowers represent and warrant that:

3.1  ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.  The Company, each Subsidiary Borrower
and each Significant Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized and in good
standing (where such concept exists) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its

hereunder and (ii) if and so long as such Subsidiary Borrower has outstanding

Commitments shall terminate and the Notes shall forthwith become due and payable

expressly waived.

7. THE BANKS AND THE AGENT

7.1  AUTHORITY OF AGENT.  Each of the Banks authorizes the Agent to act on
its behalf to the extent herein provided and to exercise such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto, including the receipt of all payments of
principal of and interest on the Notes, fees and other amounts payable
hereunder, with full power and authority as attorney-in-fact for the Banks to
institute and maintain actions, suits or proceedings for the collection and
enforcement of the Notes and to file such proofs of debt or other documents as
may be necessary to have the claims of the Banks allowed in any proceeding
relative to any Borrower or its creditors or affecting its properties and to
take such other action for the protection, collection and enforcement of the
Notes as the Agent may deem advisable. The Agent may take any such action in its
discretion and shall take such action for the protection, collection and
enforcement of the Notes as may be requested by the Majority Banks. The
relationship between the Agent and each Bank has no fiduciary aspects, and the
Agent's duties (as Agent) hereunder are acknowledged to be only ministerial and
not involving the exercise of discretion on its part. Nothing in this Agreement
or any Note shall be construed to impose on the Agent any duties or
responsibilities other than those for which express provision is made herein or
therein. In performing its duties and functions hereunder, the Agent does not
assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed, and hereby expressly disclaims,
any obligation with or for the Borrowers. As to matters not expressly provided
for in this Agreement or any Note, the Agent shall not be required to exercise
any discretion or to take any action or communicate any notice, but shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting upon the instructions of
the Majority Banks

<PAGE>

and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Agent be required to take any action which exposes it to personal
liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, any Note or applicable law,
and the Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
hereunder unless it shall first be specifically indemnified to its satisfaction
by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by
it by reason of taking or omitting to take any such action. If an indemnity
furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the reasonable opinion of the
Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for additional
indemnity from the Banks and not commence or cease to do the acts for which such
indemnity is requested until such additional indemnity is furnished. The
Majority Banks may revoke the authority of the Agent set forth herein effective
upon receipt of written notice by the Agent of such revocation. The Agent shall
promptly notify the Banks of any Event of Default.

7.2  RESPONSIBILITY OF AGENT.  In performing its functions and duties
hereunder on behalf of the Banks, the Agent shall exercise the same care and
skill as it would exercise in dealing with loans for its own account. Neither
the Agent nor any of its directors, officers or employees shall be liable for
any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Each Borrower shall certify to the Agent the names and signatures of
its officers authorized to sign Notes, execute certificates and otherwise act in
respect hereof, and the Agent may conclusively rely thereon until receipt by it
of notice to the contrary. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any opinion
of counsel (including counsel for the Borrowers) in relation to this Agreement.
The Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until written
notice of transfer shall have been filed with it. The Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrowers of any such notice received by it.

7.3  PRO-RATA PAYMENTS. If any Bank, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, receives payment of principal or interest or other
amount due on any Loan or Letter of Credit, which is greater than the percentage
share of such Bank (determined as set forth below), the Bank receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans
or Letter of Credit obligations held by the other Banks, and such other
adjustments shall be made as may be required, so that all such payments shall be
shared by the Banks on the basis of their percentage shares; provided that if
all or any portion of such proportionately greater payment of such indebtedness
is thereafter recovered from, or must otherwise be restored by, such purchasing
Bank, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest being paid by such purchasing
Bank.  The percentage share of each Bank shall be based on the portion of the
outstanding Loans and Letter of Credit Outstandings due such Bank (prior to
receiving any payment for which an adjustment must be made under this Section
7.3)) in relation to the aggregate outstanding Loans and Letter of Credit
Outstandings due all the Banks (prior to receiving any payment of which an
adjustment must be made under this Section 7.3).

7.4  INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT.  Each of the Banks agrees (which agreement
shall survive payment of the Notes) to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrowers), in amounts which are pro rata to their respective
Commitments, if such amounts are due prior to the making of the Loans hereunder,
and thereafter to the outstanding principal amount of their respective

<PAGE>

Loans, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in
any way related to or arising out of this Agreement, the Notes or the Loans or
any action taken or omitted by the Agent, except any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct; provided, however, that in the event any Bank is required hereunder
to make available to the Agent the amount of a Loan, and any such Bank fails to
make such amount available to the Agent, such Bank agrees to indemnify the Agent
to the extent provided in Section 2.2 hereof. All reasonable expenses, including
reasonable counsel fees, incurred by the Agent in taking any action hereunder
shall be borne, subject to the Borrowers' liability therefor, by the Banks pro
rata in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages under this
Agreement, and the Banks hereby agree to reimburse the Agent for all such
expenses on request.

7.5  CREDIT DECISION.  Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently
and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also acknowledges
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other
Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
any action under this Agreement. Each of the Banks agrees that the Agent shall
not have any responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of any information
contained in any document, or any oral information, supplied to such Bank by the
Borrowers directly or through the Agent.

7.6  THE AGENT AS A BANK.  With respect to its Commitment and the Loans
made and to be made by it, CoreStates Bank, N.A. shall have the same rights,
powers and obligations under this Agreement and its Notes as the other Banks and
may exercise the same as if it were not the Agent, and the terms "BANK" and
"BANKS" as used herein shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include
CoreStates Bank, N.A. in its individual capacity. CoreStates Bank, N.A. and any
successor Agent which is a commercial bank, and their respective affiliates, may
accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of and
generally engage in any kind of business with, any Borrower and its affiliates
from time to time, all as if the Agent were not the agent hereunder and without
any duty to account therefor to any Bank.

7.7  SUCCESSOR AGENT.  The Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice of such resignation to the Banks and the Borrowers, such resignation or
removal to be effective only upon the appointment of a successor Agent as
hereinafter provided. Upon any such notice of resignation, the Banks other than
the Bank, if any, then serving as Agent shall jointly appoint a successor Agent
upon written notice to the Borrowers and the retiring Agent. If no successor
Agent shall have been jointly appointed by such Banks and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent shall have given notice
of resignation, the retiring Agent may, upon notice to the Borrowers and the
Banks, appoint a successor Agent. Upon its acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder, the successor Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all
of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from

<PAGE>

its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions hereof shall inure to its benefit as to
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Agent under this
Agreement.

7.8  WITHHOLDING TAXES.  Each Bank (a) represents and warrants to, and
agrees with, the Agent that with respect to Loans to Borrowers that are not
Foreign Subsidiaries under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required
to be withheld by the Agent with respect to any payments to be made to such Bank
hereunder, and (b) agrees to furnish (if it is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof) to the Agent
prior to the time that the Agent pays over to such Bank its portion of any
payment of interest or principal or their amounts hereunder either (i) U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form 4224 or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
(wherein such Bank claims entitlement to the benefits of a tax treaty that
provides for a complete exemption from U.S. federal income withholding tax on
all interest payments hereunder) and (ii) a new Form 1001 or Form 4224 upon the
obsolescence of any previously delivered form or comparable statements in
accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments thereto,
duly executed and completed by such Bank, and (c) agrees to comply, from time to
time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard to such
withholding tax exemption. Upon request of the Agent from time to time, each
Bank shall deliver to the Agent such evidence of compliance with this Section as
the Agent requires.

7.9  ALLOCATIONS MADE BY AGENT.  As between the Agent and the Banks, unless
a Bank objecting to a determination or allocation made by the Agent pursuant to
this Agreement delivers to the Agent written notice of such objection within one
hundred twenty (120) days after the date any distribution was made by the Agent,
such determination or allocation shall be conclusive on such one hundred
twentieth day and only those items expressly objected to in such notice shall be
deemed disputed by such Bank.  The Agent shall not have any duty to inquire as
to the application by the Banks of any amounts distributed to them.

8. INDEMNIFICATION

8.1  INDEMNIFICATION OF THE AGENT AND THE BANKS.  Each Borrower hereby
agrees to indemnify and defend the Agent, each Bank and each Participant and
their respective directors, officers, agents, employees and counsel, from and
hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
damages, interests, costs, judgments or expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, asserted against or incurred by any of them by or to any third
party arising out of or in connection with any Bank's Commitment, this
Agreement, or the Bank's financing of such Borrower's business and operations,
except any such amount claimed by a Bank resulting from such Bank's gross
negligence or wilful misconduct.  All obligations provided for in this Section
8.1 shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Notes, the repayment
of indebtedness hereunder, or any action taken by any Bank in the enforcement of
its rights and remedies, hereunder or thereunder, or any condition or event
relating to any Borrower or its business or operations.

or other payments due hereunder.

9.3  PARTICIPATIONS.  Each Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that any

its Note or of its right, title and interest therein or in or to this Agreement,
(collectively, "PARTICIPATIONS") to any other lending office or to any other
bank, lending institution, or any other entity which has the requisite
sophistication to evaluate the merits and risks of investments in Participations
(collectively, "PARTICIPANTS"); provided, however, that: (i) all amounts payable
by the Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if such Bank had not granted
such Participation, and (ii) any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant

modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, (y) may provide that
such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or

amendment, modification or waiver would reduce the principal of or rate of
interest on such Loans or postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal
of or interest on such Loans, and (z) shall not relieve such Bank from its
obligations, which shall remain absolute, to make Loans hereunder. No
Participant shall have the benefit of the provisions contained in Section 2.13

assign, pledge or hypothecate all or any portion of its Note to any Federal
Reserve Bank.

9.4  EXPENSES.  The Borrowers agree to pay the reasonable out-of-pocket
fees and expenses of the Agent incurred in connection with the negotiation and

in any case shall entitle any Borrower to any other or further notice or demand

FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING WHICH MAY BE BROUGHT AGAINST IT UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES EXECUTED AND DELIVERED HEREUNDER OR TO ENFORCE ANY

and the Company agrees to cause each Subsidiary Borrower at all times to
maintain, the Company as its agent for service of process for all purposes
of this Agreement and the Notes. Each Subsidiary Borrower hereby appoints
the Company as its agent for such purpose and agrees that service may be
made upon it by mailing to the attention of the Treasury Department, FAXING
or delivering a copy of such process to it in care of the Company at the
Company's address as provided in Section 9.1 hereof and it hereby
irrevocably authorizes and directs the Company to accept such service on

such Borrower waives such immunity and agrees not to claim the same.

following receipt by such Bank or the Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in
the Judgment Currency, such Bank or Agent, in accordance with normal banking
procedures, purchases the Original Currency with the Judgment Currency.  If the
amount of Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to

may be, such Bank or the Agent agrees to remit such excess to the Company on
behalf of the Borrowers.

9.15 TERMINATION OF THE 1994 CREDIT.  Upon the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the parties hereto that also are parties to the 1994 Credit,
all agreements relating to any such facility shall be deemed terminated and be
of no further force and effect without need of further action on the part of any
Bank or any Borrower that is a party thereto, and any rights to prior notice of
such termination provided thereunder are hereby waived; provided, however, that
such termination shall not relieve any Borrower that is a party to any such
facility of any obligation with respect to fees, charges or other matters under

SCHEDULE A

Nikon Inc. v. IKON Office Solutions, Inc., et al. - On June 19, 1996,
plaintiff filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District
of New York alleging trademark infringement, trademark dilution, false
designation of origin, unfair competition and tortious interference with
prospective business advantage.  Plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief,
restitution and damages.  Although the allegations are being investigated, it is
counsel's belief that all claims are without merit.  Monetary damages are
difficult to estimate at this time.  However, IKON will vigorously defend its
use of the IKON name.

SCHEDULE B

All liens on any accounts or equipment giving rise to such accounts, arising in
connection with the Securitizations reported in the September 30, 1996 financial

WILLIAM F. DRAKE, JR., ESQUIRE
GENERAL COUNSEL
ALCO STANDARD CORPORATION


December __, 1996


CoreStates Bank, N.A.
Itself and as Agent to
Each of the Banks Named on
Exhibit A Attached Hereto
Broad & Chestnut Streets
Philadelphia, PA  19107

Attn:  Mr. David W. Mills
Vice President

Re:  Credit Agreement, dated December ___, 1996 among Alco Standard
Corporation and certain subsidiaries and the Banks named on
Schedule A attached hereto with CoreStates Bank, N.A., as Agent
Gentlemen:

As General Counsel of Alco Standard Corporation, an Ohio corporation (the
"COMPANY"), I have served as counsel to the Company in connection with a Credit
Agreement, dated December __, 1996 (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), among the Company,
certain subsidiaries of the Company, the Banks named on Exhibit A attached
hereto and CoreStates Bank, N.A., as Agent for the Banks.  Terms defined in the
Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.

I have examined the Credit Agreement with its exhibits and the originals or
copies, certified or otherwise authenticated to my satisfaction, of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Code of Regulations, both as amended to date,
of the Company and such other documents and instruments, and have made such
further inquiries of law and fact, as I have deemed appropriate for purposes of
this opinion.

Based upon the foregoing, I advise you that, in my opinion:

1.   The Company and each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (where such concept exists) under the laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all the corporate power and
authority necessary to own its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and as is presently proposed to be conducted and, in the case of

D-1
<PAGE>

the Company, to enter into and perform its obligations under each of the Credit
Agreement and the Notes. Further, the Company and each Subsidiary is qualified
as a foreign corporation in the various jurisdictions wherein the nature of the
business they transact makes such qualification necessary.

2.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Company and its
Subsidiaries of the Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on its part. Neither the execution, delivery,
issuance and performance by the Company nor its Subsidiaries of this Agreement
nor the Notes (i) require any consent or approval of any shareholder of the
Company or any Subsidiary, as such, or of any public authority, (ii) violate any
provision of law (including without limitation any usury law) or any provision
of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Code of Regulations of the Company or
any rule or regulation (including without limitation Regulations G, T, U and X
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award presently in effect and having
application to the Company, or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a
default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien or charge
upon any property of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of, the
Certificate of Incorporation or Code of Regulations of the Company, the
applicable corporate documents of any Subsidiary or any indenture, loan or
credit agreement or other agreement, lease or instrument to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its
properties may be subject. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default
under any such law, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or
award to an extent that would adversely affect the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Credit Agreement or the Notes.

3.   Each of the Credit Agreement and the Notes has been duly executed,
delivered and issued by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms. The obligation of the Company includes but is not limited to the
obligation to pay the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans made by the
Banks pursuant to the Credit Agreement whether or not the Company was the
Borrower at the time the Loan was made. The foregoing opinions as to
enforceability are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
and other laws and equitable principles affecting the enforceability of
creditors' rights generally. No authorization, consent, approval, license,
exemption of or filing or registration with any court or other tribunal or any
governmental department, commission, board, bureau or agency, domestic or
foreign, is or under present law will be necessary to the valid execution,
delivery or performance by the Company of the Credit Agreement or any Note.

4.   There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened
against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their assets or
properties before any court or other tribunal or any governmental department,
commission, board, bureau or agency, domestic or foreign, which, if determined
adversely to the Company or any Subsidiary, could have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, operations or properties of the Company or any
Subsidiary or on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the
Credit Agreement or the Notes. I am not aware of any challenge in any pending or
threatened action or proceeding to any material patent, copyright, franchise or
other right owned, leased or otherwise held by the Company or any Subsidiary.

D-2
<PAGE>

5.   Except for Partners Securities Company, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is engaged principally or as one of its important activities in the
business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin
stocks (within the meaning of Regulations G, T, U and X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System). Assuming all of the proceeds of each
of the Loans will be applied duly in accordance with the provisions of the
Credit Agreement, no part of the proceeds of any Loan made under the Credit
Agreement will be applied for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin
stocks or of refinancing any credit previously extended or of extending credit
to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any such margin stocks.

6.   None of the Banks will be required, by reason of the execution and
delivery of the Credit Agreement and the making of the Loans, to register or
qualify to do business under any law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
relating to the registration or qualification of foreign corporations. There are
no documentary stamp taxes payable in connection with the execution and delivery
of any of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.

This Opinion is intended solely for the benefit of, and may only be relied
upon by, the Agent and each of the Banks.

Very truly yours,



William F. Drake, Jr.
General Counsel

Itself and as Agent to
Each of the Banks Named on
Exhibit A Attached Hereto
Broad & Chestnut Streets
Philadelphia, PA  19107

Attn:  Mr. David W. Mills
Vice President

Re: Credit Agreement, dated December ___, 1996 among Alco Standard
Corporation and certain subsidiaries and the Banks named on Schedule
A attached hereto with CoreStates Bank, N.A., as Agent
Gentlemen:

1.   We have acted as legal advisers in [England] to [name of subsidiary] ALCO
OFFICE PRODUCTS (U.K.) PLC (the "COMPANY") in connection with a credit
agreement dated as of December 1, 1994 made between the Company and Alco
Standard Corporation (the "BORROWERS"), the Banks named on Exhibit A
attached hereto (the "BANKS") and CoreStates Bank, N.A. (as Agent for the
Banks) relating to the granting of a facility of up to $400,000,000 by the
Banks to the Borrowers (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT").

2.   Terms defined in the Credit Agreement have the same meanings when used in
this opinion.

3.   For the purposes of this opinion, we have examined the following documents:

(a)   draft [certified] copy of the Credit Agreement;

(b)   a [certified] copy of resolutions of the Board of Directors (and/or a
duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) of the Company
relating (inter alia) to the Credit Agreement;

(c)   a [certified] copy of the [Memorandum and Articles of Association]
[applicable charter documents] of the Company;

E-1
<PAGE>

(d)   a [certified] copy of resolutions, signed by all the shareholders of
the Company, relating to the assumption of joint liability under the
Credit Agreement; and

(e)   [microfiches of the Company's files at the Companies Registry in
London as at _____________, 199__.]

4.   Except as stated above, we have not examined any contracts, instruments or
other documents entered into by or affecting the Company or any corporate
records of the Company and have not made any other inquiries concerning the
Company or made any search at [the High Court, Strand, London] in respect
of winding-up or similar petitions.

5.   We have not investigated the laws of any country other than [England]
[jurisdiction of incorporation] and this opinion is given only with respect
to [English] law. We assume that no foreign law affects any of the
conclusions stated below. We have not investigated whether the Company is
or will by reason of the transactions and matters contemplated by the
Credit Agreement be in breach of any of its obligations under any
agreement, document, deed or instrument.

6.   Based upon the foregoing and subject to any matters not disclosed to us,
and subject to the qualifications set out below we are of the opinion that:

(1)  The Company is a [limited liability] [public liability] company, duly
incorporated and subsisting under the laws of [England];

(2)  The Company has all requisite corporate power to enter into and
perform the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby
and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of the Credit Agreement and the
transactions and matters contemplated thereby;

(3)  The entry into and performance of the Credit Agreement by the Company
and the transactions and matters contemplated thereby to be undertaken
by the Company do not and will not violate the [Memorandum of Articles
of Association] [charter documents] of the Company;

(4)  No authorizations, approvals, consents, licenses, exemptions, filing,
registrations or other requirement of governmental, judicial and
public bodies and authorities of or in [England] are required in
connection with the entry into, performance, validity or
enforceability of the Credit Agreement;

(5)  Subject to its enforceability under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (and to the assumptions and qualifications set out in
this letter), the Credit Agreement would be enforceable against the
Company in [England] and the Credit Agreement contains, subject as
otherwise provided herein, no provisions which (if it were subject to,
and construed in accordance with, [English] law) would be contrary to
law or

E-2
<PAGE>

public policy in [England] or which would for any reason not be upheld
by the courts in [England];

(6)  The choice of the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to govern
the Credit Agreement would be recognized and enforced by the courts in
[England] save that there is some doubt in the event that a contract
is avoided, as to whether as a matter of [English] law the choice of
law provision would survive;

(7)  The submission to the jurisdiction of the courts in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania as set out in the Credit Agreement constitutes a valid
submission by the Company;

(8)  A judgment of a competent state or federal court sitting in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania finally and conclusively establishing a
debt should be capable of enforcement in the competent courts of
[England] without a re-examination of the merits, provided that the
defendant may have defenses open to it and enforcement may not be
permitted if, inter alia, the judgement was obtained by fraud, was
contrary to public policy of [English] law, relates to foreign penal
or revenue laws, is contrary to natural justice, amounts to judgement
on a matter previously determined by an [English] court, is given in
proceedings brought in breach of agreement for settlement of disputes
[or if enforcement of the judgement is restricted by the provisions of
the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980];

(9)  To ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility into
evidence of the Credit Agreement in the courts of [England], it is not
necessary that the Credit Agreement be registered, notarized, filed or
recorded with any court or other authority in [England] or that any
stamp or similar tax be paid with respect thereto in [England];

(10) No approval, consent or withholding of objection on the part of, or
filing, registration or qualification with, any government department
or regulatory authority, is necessary under the laws of [England and
Wales] as a condition to the lawful execution, delivery and
performance of the Credit Agreement.

7.   The searches made on [       ] 1996 at [the Companies Registry] revealed no
order or resolution for the winding-up or order for the administration of
the Company and no notice of the appointment of a receiver, liquidator or
similar person; but such a search is not capable of revealing whether or
not a winding-up petition has been presented, and notice of an order or
resolution for winding-up or an order for administration or notice of the
appointment of a receiver, liquidator or similar person may not be filed at
[the Companies Registry] immediately.

8.   This opinion is given subject to the following qualifications:

E-3
<PAGE>

(a)  the opinion is an opinion with respect to the matters referred to above in
so far as only [English domestic] law (as in force on the date of this
opinion) will itself determine those matters in the [English] Courts; and
we express no opinion as to the effect of any other law which may be held
to be applicable in determining any such matter or as to the enforceability
in any other jurisdiction of any judgement which may be obtained in the
[English] courts. An obligation to be performed in any other jurisdiction
may not be enforceable in [England] in so far as its performance would be
illegal, void or unenforceable under the laws of that other jurisdiction;

(b)  the enforcement of a claim may be or become subject to a right of set-off
or a counter-claim [or subject to any limitations imposed by the Limitation
Act of 1980 or by liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
reconstruction or similar laws of general application];

(c)  we assume:

(i)    that the Credit Agreement is within the capacity and powers of and
has been validly authorized, executed and delivered by each person
(except the Company) who is a party to the Credit Agreement;

(ii)   the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity and completeness
of every document submitted to us as an original document, the
conformity to the original document and completeness of every
document submitted to us as a certified or photostatic copy of any
document and the authenticity of its original; and

(iii)  [that the resolutions of the board of directors of the Company were
duly passed at a meeting of properly appointed directors duly
convened and held, that a duly qualified quorum of such directors
present throughout the meeting voted in favor of approving the
resolutions, that any provisions contained in the Companies Act 1985
or in the Company's Articles of Association relating to the
declaration of directors' interests or the power of interested
directors to vote were duly observed and that those resolutions have
not been rescinded or varied;]

(iv)   the accuracy of all representations as to fact made in the Credit
Agreement by the Company;

(v)    that immediately after the execution of the Credit Agreement the
Company was solvent;

[(vi)  [that none of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement
constituted financial assistance for the purposes of Section 151 of
the Companies Act 1985.]

E-4
<PAGE>

(d)  [English] Courts are prepared to render judgements for a monetary
amount in foreign currencies but the judgement may be converted into
[sterling] for enforcement purposes. Foreign currency amounts claimed
in an [English] liquidation must be converted into [sterling] at the
rate prevailing at the commencement of the liquidation;

(e)  a certificate, determination, notification or opinion of the Banks or
the Agent as to any matters provided for in the Credit Agreement might
be held by the [English] Courts not to be conclusive;

(f)  an [English] Court might not enforce a provision of a document
providing that an obligation of any party is to survive a judgement on
such document whether obtained in [England] or elsewhere on the ground
that such obligation would be discharged by a judgement;

(g)  an [English] Court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are
being brought elsewhere;

(h)  equitable remedies, such as orders for specific performance or the
issue of an injunction, are available only at the discretion of the
Court and are not normally awarded if an award of damages is
considered an adequate remedy;

(i)  an [English] Court may recognize oral amendments to the Credit
Agreement by the parties thereto notwithstanding provisions therein to
the contrary;

(j)  the question of whether or not any provisions of the Credit Agreement
which may be invalid on account of illegality may be severed from the
other provisions thereof in order to preserve the validity of those
other provisions would be determined by an [English] Court in its
discretion;

(k)  an [English] company only has authority to carry on those businesses
specified in [the objects Clause of its Memorandum of Association];

(l)  in relation to the opinion expressed at paragraph 6(5) above, the
Courts in [England] would not enforce the Credit Agreement if the
application of principles of the law of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania to the Credit Agreement would involve applying foreign
penal, revenue or public laws or involve applying foreign
expropriatory legislation or was contrary to public policy of
[English] law;

(m)  the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from a liability or
duty otherwise owed (including liability arising out of the non-
payment of stamp duty) is limited by law;

E-5
<PAGE>

(n)  we have not been involved in the drafting, preparation or negotiation
of the Credit Agreement and accordingly express no opinion as to the
sufficiency or effectiveness of the Credit Agreement to achieve the
purposes contemplated by the parties thereto;

(o)  whilst we are of the opinion that the Company has the necessary powers
under its [Memorandum and Articles of Association] to assume the joint
liability for the whole of the amounts due under the Credit Agreement,
the directors of the Company must exercise those powers bona fide in
the interest of the Company which may involve demonstrating a
sufficient commercial benefit for the Company from the arrangements
contemplated by the Credit Agreement as to which we express no
opinion;

(p)  an [English] Court may refuse to give effect to paragraph 8.1 of the
Credit Agreement in respect of the costs of unsuccessful litigation
brought before an [English] Court or where the Court has itself made
an order for costs;

(q)  a provision of the Credit Agreement providing for a higher rate of
interest to be paid on overdue sums may amount to a penalty if not
found to represent a genuine pre-estimate of loss and may therefore
not be recoverable;

(r)  the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are subject
to all laws affecting creditors' rights generally;

(s)  so far as they relate to United Kingdom stamp duties, the undertakings
and indemnities given by the Company in Sections 2.10(b) and 8.1 of
the Credit Agreement may be void under Section 117 of the Stamp Act of
1891.

9.   This opinion is given for the sole benefit of the person(s) to whom it is
addressed and is not to be relied upon by or communicated to any other
person or for any other purpose, nor is it to be quoted or referred to in
any public document or made public in any way or filed with anyone without
our prior written consent, save that it may be referred to in any
proceedings against us upon this opinion itself.

Yours faithfully,

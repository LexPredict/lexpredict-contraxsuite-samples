CREDIT AGREEMENT




THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of September 30, 2008
(the “Effective Date”), by and among OCEANEERING INTERNATIONAL, INC., a Delaware corporation
(together with its permitted successors and assigns, herein called the “Borrower”); each of the
lenders which is or may from time to time become a party hereto (individually, a “Lender” and,
collectively, the “Lenders”); and WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A., a national banking association, as
administrative agent (in such capacity, together with its successors in such capacity, the
“Administrative Agent” or “Agent”).



Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:



SECTION
1. Definitions.




Section 1.1 Certain Defined Terms.



In this Agreement, terms defined above shall have the meanings ascribed to them above. Unless
a particular term, word or phrase is otherwise defined or the context otherwise requires,
capitalized terms, words and phrases used herein or in the Loan Documents (as hereinafter defined)
have the following meanings (all definitions that are defined in this Agreement or in the Loan
Documents in the singular have the same meanings when used in the plural and vice versa):



“Additional Interest” means the aggregate of all amounts accrued or paid pursuant to the Notes
or any of the other Loan Documents (other than interest on the Notes at the Stated Rate) which,
under applicable laws, are or may be deemed to constitute interest on the indebtedness evidenced by
the Notes or any other amounts owing under any Loan Document.



“Adjusted LIBOR” means, with respect to each Interest Period applicable to a LIBOR Borrowing,
a rate per annum equal to the quotient, expressed as a percentage, of (a) LIBOR with respect to
such Interest Period divided by (b) 1.0000 minus the Eurodollar Reserve Requirement in effect on
the first day of such Interest Period.



“Administrative Questionnaire” means an Administrative Questionnaire in a form supplied by the
Agent.



“Affiliate” means any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any other
Person. For purposes of this definition, “control” (including “controlled by” and “under common
control with”) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting
securities or otherwise.



“Aggregate Commitments” means the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all the Lenders
which, as of the date hereof, shall be $85,000,000, but which may be decreased pursuant to
Section 2.4 hereof or increased pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof.



“Agreement” means this Credit Agreement, as it may from time to time be amended, modified,
restated or supplemented.



“Annual Financial Statements” means the consolidated annual financial statements of Borrower
and its Subsidiaries, including all notes thereto, which statements shall include a




















consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year relating thereto and a
consolidated income statement and a consolidated statement of cash flows for such fiscal year, all
setting forth in comparative form the corresponding figures from the previous fiscal year, all
prepared in conformity with GAAP in all material respects, and accompanied by the opinion of
independent certified public accountants of recognized national standing, which shall state that
such financial statements present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the applicable Persons as of the date thereof and the results of consolidated
operations of the applicable Persons for the period covered thereby in conformity with GAAP. As
long as Borrower files an annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
such report and related financial statements, including notes thereto and opinion of independent
certified public accountants, included thereon shall be considered the “Annual Financial
Statements”.



“Approved Fund” means any Fund that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an

Lender.

statute.

Margin Percentage from time to time in effect plus the greater of (1) the Prime Rate for that day
and (2) the Federal Funds Rate for that day plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) the Ceiling Rate. If for any
reason Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be prima facie evidence of the
correctness thereof) that it is unable to ascertain the Federal Funds Rate for any reason,
including, without limitation, the inability or failure of Agent to obtain sufficient quotations in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Base Rate shall, until the circumstances giving rise to such
inability no longer exist, be the lesser of (a) the Prime Rate plus the then applicable Margin
Percentage from time to time in effect or (b) the Ceiling Rate.



“Base Rate Borrowing” means that portion of the principal balance of the Loans at any time
bearing interest at the Base Rate.

required to close in Houston, Texas.



“Capitalized Lease” means any lease the obligation for Rentals with respect to which is
required to be capitalized on a consolidated balance sheet of the lessee and its subsidiaries in
accordance with GAAP.



“Ceiling Rate” means, on any day, with respect to any Lender, the maximum nonusurious rate of
interest, if any, permitted for that day under the law then applicable to such Lender, stated as a
rate per annum. On each day, if any, that the Texas Finance Code establishes the Ceiling




















Rate for any Lender, the Ceiling Rate for such Lender shall be the “weekly ceiling” (as
defined in Section 303 of the Texas Finance Code) for that day. Agent may from time to time, as to
current and future balances, implement any other ceiling under the Texas Finance Code by notice to
Borrower, if and to the extent applicable to any Lender and permitted by the Texas Finance Code.
Without notice to Borrower or any other person or entity, the Ceiling Rate shall automatically
fluctuate upward and downward as and in the amount by which such maximum nonusurious rate of
interest permitted by applicable law fluctuates. Notwithstanding any choice of law set forth
herein or in any other Loan Document, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws, any
Lender may elect to have the usury laws of another jurisdiction apply to the Note and the Loans
held by such Lender.



“Change of Control” shall be deemed to have occurred if any person (as such term is used in
Section 13(d) and Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the date of the Closing) or
related persons constituting a group (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as
in effect on the date of the Closing), other than an Affiliate described on Exhibit G, (i)

sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Agent) shall specify the time period
within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than 10 Business
Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders). Each Lender shall notify the Agent

shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and
(b) of Section 7.2, and (B) no Default or Event of Default exists.

Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any cash proceeds (net of (i) attorneys’ fees, investment
banking fees, accountants’ fees, underwriting discounts and commissions, escrow fees, reserves,
related swap costs and commissions and other customary fees and expenses actually incurred in
connection with the issuance of applicable Indebtedness and other similar payment obligations
resulting therefrom (other than the obligations under this Agreement) that are required to be paid
concurrently or otherwise as a result of such issuance or incurrence and (ii) other amounts that
are to be refinanced or otherwise paid with all or part of the proceeds, including purchase money
financing or other asset acquisition, upgrade or repair enabling financing) from the incurrence of
any Indebtedness of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than with respect to any
Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Agreement and Excluded Transactions), Borrower shall prepay
the Loans in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such net cash proceeds. Concurrently with any
such prepayment of the Loans, Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of
an authorized officer demonstrating the calculation of the amount of the applicable net proceeds.
In the event that Borrower shall subsequently determine that the actual net cash amount required to
be prepaid pursuant to this Section exceeded the amount set forth in such certificate, the Borrower
shall promptly make an additional prepayment of the Loans, and the Borrower shall concurrently
therewith deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of an authorized officer demonstrating
the derivation of such excess. Each mandatory prepayment shall be made without premium or penalty
other than the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans prepaid and any applicable
breakage fees and funding losses pursuant to this Agreement.




(d) Interest Payments. Accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of the
Loans shall be due and payable on the Interest Payment Dates and on the date of any prepayment of
the Loans.




(e) Interest on Past Due Payments. Subject to Section 11.7 hereof, Borrower will pay
to Agent for the account of each Lender interest at the applicable Past Due Rate on any amount
payable by Borrower hereunder to or for the account of such Lender (but, if such amount is
interest, only to the extent legally allowed), which shall not be paid in full within five (5) days
after the date due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), for the period
commencing on the expiration of such five (5) day period until the same is paid in full.






















Section 3.3 Interest Options.



(a) Options Available. The outstanding principal balance of the Notes shall bear interest at
the Base Rate; provided, that (1) subject to Section 3.2(e), all past due amounts, both
principal and accrued and unpaid interest, shall bear interest at the Past Due Rate, and (2)
subject to the provisions hereof, Borrower shall have the option of having all or any portion of
the principal balances of the Notes from time to time outstanding bear interest at a Eurodollar
Rate. The records of Agent and each of the Lenders with respect to Interest Options, Interest
Periods and the amounts of Loans to which they are applicable shall be prima facie evidence of the
correctness thereof. Interest on the Loans shall be calculated at the Base Rate except where it is
expressly provided pursuant to this Agreement that a Eurodollar Rate is to apply. Interest on the
amount of each advance against the Notes shall be computed on the amount of that advance and from
the date it is made to but excluding the date of repayment thereof. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, for the full term of the Notes the interest rate produced by the
aggregate of all sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holders of the Notes for the use,
forbearance or detention of the debt evidenced thereby (including all interest on the Notes at the
Stated Rate plus the Additional Interest) shall not exceed the Ceiling Rate.




(b) Designation and Conversion. Borrower shall have the right to designate or convert its
Interest Options in accordance with the provisions hereof. Provided no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and subject to the last sentence of Section 3.3(a) and the
provisions of Section 3.3(c), Borrower may elect to have a Eurodollar Rate apply or
continue to apply to all or any portion of the principal balance of the Notes. Each change in
Interest Options shall be a conversion of the rate of interest applicable to the specified portion
of the Loans, but such conversion shall not change the respective outstanding principal balances of
the Notes. The Interest Options shall be designated or converted in the manner provided below:





(i) Borrower shall give Agent telephonic notice, promptly confirmed by a Rate
Designation Notice (and Agent shall promptly inform each Lender thereof). Each such
telephonic and written notice shall specify the amount of the Loan which is the subject of
the designation, if any; the amount of borrowings into which such borrowings are to be
converted or for which an Interest Option is designated; the proposed date for the
designation or conversion and the Interest Period or Periods, if any, selected by Borrower.
Such telephonic notice shall be irrevocable and shall be given to Agent no later than the
applicable Rate Designation Date.




(ii) No more than five (5) LIBOR Borrowings shall be in effect at any time.




(iii) Each advance, designation or conversion of a LIBOR Borrowing shall occur on a
LIBOR Business Day.




(iv) Except as provided in Section 3.3(c) hereof, no LIBOR Borrowing may be
converted to a Base Rate Borrowing or another LIBOR Borrowing on any day other than the last
day of the applicable Interest Period.




(v) Each request for a LIBOR Borrowing shall be in the amount equal to $5,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.



















(vi) Subject to Section 3.3(c)(i), each designation of an Interest Option with
respect to the Notes shall apply to all of the Notes ratably in accordance with their
respective outstanding principal balances. If any Lender assigns an interest in its Note
when any LIBOR Borrowing is outstanding with respect thereto, then such assignee shall have
its ratable interest in such LIBOR Borrowing.



(c) Special Provisions Applicable to LIBOR Borrowings.





(i) Options Unlawful. If the adoption of any applicable Legal Requirement
after the Effective Date or any change after the Effective Date in any applicable Legal
Requirement or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force
of law) issued after the Effective Date by any central bank or other Governmental Authority
shall at any time make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to permit the establishment
of or to maintain any LIBOR Borrowing, the commitment of such Lender to establish such LIBOR
Borrowing shall forthwith be canceled and Borrower shall on the last day the Interest Period
relating to any outstanding LIBOR Borrowing (or within such earlier period as may be
required by applicable law) (1) convert the LIBOR Borrowing of such Lender to a Base Rate
Borrowing; (2) pay all accrued and unpaid interest to date on the amount so converted; and
(3) pay any amounts required to compensate each Lender for any additional cost or expense
which any Lender may incur as a result of such adoption of or change in such Legal
Requirement or in the interpretation or administration thereof and any Funding Loss which
any Lender may incur as a result of such conversion. If, when Agent so notifies Borrower,
Borrower has given a Rate Designation Notice specifying a LIBOR Borrowing but the selected
Interest Period has not yet begun, as to the applicable Lender such Rate Designation Notice
shall be deemed to be of no force and effect, as if never made, and the balance of the Loans
made by such Lender specified in such Rate Designation Notice shall bear interest at the
Base Rate until a different available Interest Option shall be designated in accordance
herewith.




(ii) Increased Cost of Borrowings. Subject to Section 11.15, if the
adoption after the Effective Date of any applicable Legal Requirement or any change after
the Effective Date in any applicable Legal Requirement or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority or compliance by any Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) issued after the Effective
Date by any central bank or Governmental Authority shall at any time as a result of any
portion of the principal balances of the Notes being maintained on the basis of a Eurodollar
Rate:




(1) subject any Lender to any Taxes, or any deduction or withholding
for any Taxes, on or from any payment due under any LIBOR Borrowing or other
amount due hereunder, other than income and franchise taxes of the United
States or its political subdivisions or such other jurisdiction in which the
applicable Lender has any office or applicable lending office; or




(2) change the basis of taxation of payments due from Borrower to any
Lender under any LIBOR Borrowing (otherwise than by a change in




















the rate of taxation of the gross revenues or overall net income of
such Lender); or




(3) impose, modify, increase or deem applicable any reserve requirement
(excluding that portion of any reserve requirement included in the
calculation of the applicable Eurodollar Rate), special deposit requirement
or similar requirement (including, but not limited to, state law
requirements) against assets of any Lender, or against deposits with any
Lender, or against loans made by any Lender, or against any other funds,
obligations or other Property owned or held by any Lender; or




(4) impose on any Lender any other condition regarding any LIBOR
Borrowing;




and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any Lender
of agreeing to make or of making, renewing or maintaining such LIBOR
Borrowing, or reduce the amount of principal or interest received by any
Lender, then, within 15 Business Days after demand by Agent (accompanied by
a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the applicable Lender’s basis
therefor), Borrower shall pay to Agent additional amounts which shall
compensate each Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount. The
determination by any Lender of the amount of any such increased cost,
increased reserve requirement or reduced amount shall be prima facie
evidence of the correctness thereof. Borrower shall have the right, if it
receives from Agent any notice referred to in this paragraph, upon three
Business Days’ notice to Agent (which shall notify each affected Lender),
either (i) to repay in full (but not in part) any borrowing with respect to
which such notice was given, together with any accrued interest thereon, or
(ii) to convert the LIBOR Borrowing which is the subject of the notice to a
Base Rate Borrowing; provided, that any such repayment or conversion shall
be accompanied by payment of (x) the amount required to compensate each
Lender for the increased cost or reduced amount referred to in the preceding
paragraph; (y) all accrued and unpaid interest to date on the amount so
repaid or converted, and (z) any Funding Loss which any Lender may incur as
a result of such repayment or conversion. Each Lender will notify Borrower
through Agent of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement which
will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section as
promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to
request such compensation, and (if so requested by Borrower through Agent)
will designate a different lending office of such Lender for the applicable
LIBOR Borrowing or will take such other action as Borrower may reasonably
request if such designation or action is consistent with the internal policy
of such Lender and legal and regulatory restrictions, will avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole
opinion of such Lender, be disadvantageous to such Lender (provided that
such Lender shall have no obligation so to designate a different lending
office which is located in the United States of America).



















(iii) Inadequacy of Pricing and Rate Determination. If, for any reason with
respect to any Interest Period, Agent (or, in the case of clause 3 below, the applicable
Lender) shall have reasonably determined that:




(1) Agent is unable through its customary general practices to
determine any applicable Eurodollar Rate, or




(2) by reason of circumstances affecting the applicable market,
generally, Agent is not being offered deposits in United States dollars in
such market, for the applicable Interest Period and in an amount equal to
the amount of any applicable LIBOR Borrowing requested by Borrower, or




(3) any applicable Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to any Lender of making and maintaining such LIBOR
Borrowing hereunder for any proposed Interest Period,




then Agent shall give Borrower notice thereof and thereupon, (A) any Rate
Designation Notice previously given by Borrower designating the applicable
LIBOR Borrowing which has not commenced as of the date of such notice from
Agent shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to be of no force and effect,
as if never given, and (B) until Agent shall notify Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice from Agent no longer exist, each
Rate Designation Notice requesting the applicable Eurodollar Rate shall be
deemed a request for a Base Rate Borrowing, and any applicable LIBOR
Borrowing then outstanding shall be converted, without any notice to or from
Borrower, upon the termination of the Interest Period then in effect with
respect to it, to a Base Rate Borrowing.




(iv) Funding Losses. Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against and hold
each Lender harmless from any Funding Loss. Subject to Section 11.15, this
indemnity shall survive the payment of the Notes. Within 15 Business Days after demand by
Agent (accompanied by a certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount and calculation of the amount claimed as to any Funding Losses, which shall be prima
facie evidence of the correctness thereof), Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the account of
such Lender, the amount of such Funding Losses.



(d) Funding Offices; Adjustments Automatic; Calculation Year. Any Lender may, if it so
elects, fulfill its obligation as to any LIBOR Borrowing by causing a branch or affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan and may transfer and carry such Loan at, to or for the account of any
branch office or affiliate of such Lender; provided, that in such event for the purposes of this
Agreement such Loan shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender and the obligation of Borrower
to repay such Loan shall nevertheless be to such Lender and shall be deemed held by it for the
account of such branch or affiliate. Without notice to Borrower or any other Person, each rate
required to be calculated or determined under this Agreement shall automatically fluctuate upward
and downward in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Interest at the Prime Rate and
at the Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year
consisting of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. All other interest required to be calculated or
determined under this Agreement shall be computed on



















the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year consisting of 360 days, unless the
Ceiling Rate would thereby be exceeded, in which event, to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding
the Ceiling Rate, the applicable interest shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed in the applicable calendar year in which accrued.




(e) Funding Sources. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of the Loans in any
manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all
determinations hereunder shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each
LIBOR Borrowing during each Interest Period through the purchase of deposits having a maturity
corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate for
such Interest Period.




SECTION
4. Payments; Pro Rata Treatment; Computations, Etc.




Section 4.1 Payments.



(a) The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate amount of Loans
outstanding on such date.




(b) Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of principal, interest and
other amounts to be made by Borrower hereunder, under the Notes and under the other Loan Documents
shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available funds, to Agent at the Principal Office (or in
the case of a successor Agent, at the principal office of such successor Agent in the United
States), not later than 11:00 a.m. central time on the date on which such payment shall become due
(each such payment made after such time on such due date to be deemed to have been made on the next
succeeding Business Day).




(c) Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment hereunder, under any Note or under any
other Loan Document, specify to Agent the Loans or other amounts payable by Borrower hereunder or
thereunder to which such payment is to be applied. Each payment received by Agent hereunder, under
any Note or under any other Loan Document for the account of a Lender shall be paid promptly to
such Lender, in immediately available funds. If Agent fails to send to any Lender the applicable
amount by the close of business on the date any such payment is received by Agent if such payment
is received prior to 11:00 a.m. central time (or on the next succeeding Business Day with respect
to payments which are received after 11:00 a.m. central time), Agent shall pay to the applicable
Lender interest on such amount from such date at the Federal Funds Rate. Borrower, the Lenders and
Agent acknowledge and agree that this provision and each other provision of this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents relating to the application of amounts in payment of the Obligations
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.2(f) regarding pro rata application of
amounts after an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.




(d) If the due date of any payment hereunder or under any Note falls on a day which is not a
Business Day, the due date for such payments (except as otherwise provided in clause (2) of the
definition of “Interest Period”) shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest
shall be payable for any principal so extended for the period of such extension.






















(e) All payments by Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and
clear of and without deduction for or on account of any present or future income, stamp, or other
taxes, fees, duties, withholding or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing
authority excluding in the case of Agent and each Lender taxes imposed on or measured by its net
income or franchise taxes imposed by the jurisdiction in which it is organized or through which it
acts for purposes of this Agreement (such non-excluded items being hereinafter referred to as
“Taxes”). If as a result of any change in law (or the interpretation thereof) after the date that
Agent or the applicable Lender became a party to this Agreement, any withholding or deduction from
any payment to be made to, or for the account of, such Person by Borrower hereunder or under any
other Loan Document is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule, or
regulation, then Borrower will (i) pay to the relevant authority the full amount required to be so
withheld or deducted; (ii) to the extent available, promptly forward to Agent an official receipt
or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to Agent evidencing such payment to such authority;
and (iii) pay to Agent, for the account of each affected Person, such additional amount or amounts
as are necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by such Lender will equal the full
amount such Person would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required. Each
such Person shall determine such additional amount or amounts payable to it (which determination
shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness thereof). If Agent or any Lender becomes aware
that any such withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by Borrower hereunder or under
any other Loan Document is required, then such Person shall promptly notify Agent and Borrower
thereof stating the reasons therefor and the additional amount required to be paid under this
Section. Each Lender shall execute and deliver to Agent and Borrower such forms as it may be
required to execute and deliver pursuant to Section 11.13 hereof. To the extent that any
such withholding or deduction results from the failure of a Lender to provide a form required by
Section 11.13 hereof (unless such failure is due to some prohibition under applicable Legal
Requirements), Borrower shall have no obligation to pay the additional amount required by clause
(iii) above. Anything in this Section notwithstanding, if any Lender elects to require payment by
Borrower of any material amount under this Section, Borrower may, within 60 days after the date of
receiving notice thereof and so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, elect to
terminate such Lender as a party to this Agreement; provided that, concurrently with such
termination Borrower shall (i) if Agent and each of the other Lenders shall consent, pay that
Lender all principal, interest and fees and other amounts owed to such Lender through such date of
termination or (ii) have arranged for another financial institution approved by Agent (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) as of such date, to become a substitute Lender
for all purposes under this Agreement in the manner provided in Section 11.6; provided
further that, prior to substitution for any Lender, Borrower shall have given written notice to
Agent of such intention and the Lenders shall have the option, but no obligation, for a period of
60 days after receipt of such notice, to increase their Commitments in order to replace the
affected Lender in lieu of such substitution.




Section 4.2 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a)
each borrowing from the Lenders under Section 2.1 hereof shall be made ratably from the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments at such time; (b) each termination or
reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders under Section 2.4 hereof shall be applied, pro
rata, according to the Lenders’ respective Commitments at such time, and (c) each payment by
Borrower of principal of or interest on the Loans shall be made to Agent for the account of the
Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of such Loans held by
the Lenders.


















Section 4.3 Certain Actions, Notices, Etc. Notices to Agent of any termination or
reduction of Commitments and of borrowings and optional prepayments of Loans shall be irrevocable
and shall be effective only if received by Agent not later than 12:00 noon central time on the
number of Business Days prior to the date of the relevant termination, reduction, borrowing and/or
prepayment specified below:






Number of Business
Days
Prior Notice
Termination or Reduction of Commitments
3
Loan repayment
1
Borrowing of the Base Rate
1
Selection of a Eurodollar Rate
3 LIBOR Business Days
Prepayment of Base Rate Borrowing
1
Prepayment of LIBOR Borrowing
3 LIBOR Business Days





Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the amount of the applicable Commitment
to be terminated or reduced. Each such notice of borrowing or prepayment shall specify the amount
of the Loans to be borrowed or prepaid and the date of borrowing or prepayment (which shall be a
Business Day). Agent shall promptly notify the affected Lenders of the contents of each such
notice.




Section 4.4 Non-Receipt of Funds by Agent. Unless Agent shall have been notified by a
Lender or Borrower (the “Payor”) prior to the date on which such Lender is to make payment to Agent
of the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder or Borrower is to make a payment to Agent for
the account of one or more of the Lenders, as the case may be (such payment being herein called the
“Required Payment”), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend
to make the Required Payment to Agent, Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and
may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof
available to the intended recipient on such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the
Required Payment to Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand, pay to Agent the amount
made available by Agent, together with interest thereon in respect of the period commencing on the
date such amount was so made available by Agent until the date Agent recovers such amount at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such period.



Section 4.5 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If a Lender shall obtain payment of any
principal of or interest on account of any Loan made by it under this Agreement or on any other
Obligation then due to such Lender hereunder, through the exercise of any right of set-off
(including, without limitation, any right of setoff or Lien granted under Section 9.2
hereof), banker’s lien, counterclaim or similar right or otherwise, it shall promptly purchase from
the other Lenders participations in the Loans made or other Obligations held, by the other Lenders
in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable to the end
that all the Lenders shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any expenses which may be
incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit) pro rata in accordance with the
unpaid Obligations then due to each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of




















such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from
each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase
price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the
total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. To such end all the
Lenders shall make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold
or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. Borrower agrees, to the
fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender so purchasing a
participation in the Loans made or other Obligations held, by other Lenders may exercise all rights
of set-off, bankers’ lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans or other Obligations in the amount of such
participation. Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or
shall affect the right of any Lender to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such
right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of Borrower.



SECTION 5. Conditions Precedent to Borrowings.




Section 5.1 Initial Borrowings. The obligation of each Lender to make its initial
Borrowing hereunder is subject to the following conditions precedent, each of which shall have been
fulfilled or waived to the satisfaction of Agent:



(a) Authorization and Status. Agent shall have received (i) copies of the Organizational
Documents of Borrower certified as true and correct by its secretary, assistant secretary or other
equivalent officer, (ii) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent of all action taken by Borrower
authorizing the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents and all other documents
related to this Agreement to which it is a party (including, without limitation, a certificate of
the secretary, assistant secretary or other equivalent officer of each such party which is a
corporation setting forth the resolutions of its board of directors authorizing the transactions
contemplated thereby), and (iii) such certificates as may be appropriate to demonstrate the
qualification and good standing of Borrower in the jurisdiction of its organization and in each
other jurisdiction where the failure in which to qualify could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.




(b) Incumbency. Borrower shall have delivered to Agent a certificate in respect of the name
and signature of each of the officers (i) who is authorized to sign on its behalf the applicable
Loan Documents to which it is a party related to any Loan and (ii) who will, until replaced by
another officer or officers duly authorized for that purpose, act as its representative for the
purposes of signing documents and giving notices and other communications in connection with any
Loan. Agent and each Lender may conclusively rely on such certificates until they receive notice
in writing from Borrower to the contrary.




(c) Notes. Agent shall have received the appropriate Notes of Borrower for each Lender, duly
completed and executed.




(d) Loan Documents. Borrower shall have duly executed and delivered the Loan Documents to
which it is a party (in such number of copies as Agent shall have requested). Each



















such Loan Document shall be in substantially the form furnished to the Lenders prior to their
execution of this Agreement, together with such changes therein as Agent may approve.




(e) Fees and Expenses. Borrower shall have paid to Agent all unpaid fees in the amounts
previously agreed upon in writing among Borrower and Agent.




(f) Opinions of Counsel. Agent shall have received such opinions of counsel to Borrower as
Agent shall reasonably request with respect to Borrower and the Loan Documents.




(g) Consents. Agent shall have received evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Majority
Lenders that all material consents of each Governmental Authority and of each other Person, if any,
reasonably required by the Agent in connection with (a) the Loans and (b) the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents have been satisfactorily obtained.




(h) Other Documents. Agent shall have received such other documents consistent with the terms
of this Agreement and relating to the transactions contemplated hereby as Agent may reasonably
request.




Section 5.2 All Borrowings. The obligation of each Lender to make any Loan to be made
by it hereunder is subject to: (a) the accuracy, in all material respects, on the date of such
Loan of all representations and warranties of Borrower contained in this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, except to the extent expressly limited to an earlier date; (b) Agent shall have
received the following, all of which shall be duly executed and in Proper Form: (1) a Request for
Extension of Credit as to the Loan no later than 12:00 noon central time on the Business Day on
which such Request for Extension of Credit must be given under Section 4.3 hereof and (2)
such other documents as Agent may reasonably require; (c) prior to the making of such Loan, there
shall have occurred no event which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
(d) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and (e) the making of
such Loan shall not be illegal or prohibited by any Legal Requirement. The submission by Borrower
of a Request for Extension of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty that the
conditions precedent to the applicable Loan have been satisfied.



SECTION 6. Representations and Warranties.




To induce Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Borrowings,
Borrower represents and warrants (such representations and warranties to survive any investigation
and the making of the Borrowings) to the Lenders and Agent as follows:



Section 6.1 Organization. Borrower and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries (a) is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization; (b) has all necessary corporate and organizational power and authority to conduct its
business as presently conducted, and (c) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in
the jurisdiction of its organization and in all jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 6.2 Financial Statements. Borrower has furnished to Agent (i) audited
financial statements (including a balance sheet) as to Borrower which fairly present in all
material respects, in accordance with GAAP, the consolidated financial condition and the results




















of operations of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the end of the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2007, and (ii) unaudited financial statements (including a balance sheet) as to
Borrower which fairly present in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP (subject to
year-end adjustments and the absence of notes), the consolidated financial condition and the
results of operations of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the end of the fiscal quarters ended
March 31, 2008 and June 30, 2008. No events, conditions or circumstances have occurred from the
date that the actual financial statements were delivered to Agent through the Effective Date which
would cause said financial statements to be misleading in any material respect, provided that, with
respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was
prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it being
recognized by the Lenders that such projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts
and that actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may differ
from the projected results. There are no material instruments or liabilities which should be
reflected in such financial statements provided to Agent which are not so reflected that are
necessary in order for such financial statement presentation to conform to GAAP. Since
December 31, 2007, no event has occurred and no circumstance has arisen which could reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 6.3 Enforceable Obligations; Authorization. The Loan Documents are legal,
valid and binding obligations of Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws and judicial decisions
affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general equitable principles. The execution, delivery
and performance of the Loan Documents by Borrower (a) have all been duly authorized by all
necessary action; (b) are within the corporate power and authority of Borrower; (c) do not and will
not contravene or violate any Legal Requirement applicable to Borrower or the Organizational
Documents of Borrower, the contravention or violation of which could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect; (d) do not and will not result in the breach of, or constitute a default
under, any material agreement or instrument by which Borrower or any of its Property may be bound,
and (e) do not and will not result in the creation of any Lien upon any Property of Borrower,
except in favor of Agent or as expressly contemplated herein or therein. All necessary permits,
registrations and consents for such making and performance have been obtained.

effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, execution, filing, registration, collectibility,
recording, perfection, existence or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or any Property covered thereby or for
any failure by Borrower or any other Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder or

(c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder
or under any other Loan Document except to the extent requested by the Majority Lenders; (d) shall

provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, PURSUANT TO ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, except for its own gross negligence or willful

accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (g) shall not be
responsible for any delay, error, omission or default of any mail, telegraph, cable or wireless
agency or operator, and (h) shall not be responsible for the acts or edicts of any Governmental
Authority. Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable
care.




Section 10.2 Reliance. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certification, notice
or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telegram or cable) believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or
Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (which may be counsel for Borrower),
independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent. Agent shall not be required in any
way to determine the identity or authority of any Person delivering or executing the same. As to
any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Agent shall in
all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and thereunder in
accordance with instructions of the Majority Lenders, and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. If any order, writ, judgment or decree
shall be made or entered by any court affecting the rights, duties and obligations of Agent under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then and in any of such events Agent is authorized, in
its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is
advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it under the terms of this Agreement,
the relevant Loan Document or otherwise; and if Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment
or decree, then it shall not be liable to any Lender or to any other Person by reason of such
compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.



Section 10.3 Defaults. Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence
of a Default or Event of Default (other than the non-payment of principal of or interest on Loans)
unless Agent has received notice from a Lender or Borrower specifying such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a “Notice of Default.” In the event that Agent receives
such a Notice of Default, Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders (and shall give
each Lender prompt notice of each such non-payment). Agent shall (subject to Section 10.7
hereof) take such action with respect to such Notice of Default as shall

















be directed by the Majority Lenders and within its rights under the Loan Documents and at law
or in equity, provided that, unless and until Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, permitted
hereby with respect to such Notice of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of
the Lenders and within its rights under the Loan Documents, at law or in equity.

notice of a Material nature from Borrower under the Loan Documents, Agent shall promptly inform
each of the Lenders thereof.

hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting in its agency
capacity, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include
Agent in its individual capacity. Agent may (without having to account therefor to any Lender)
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, letter of
credit, agency or other business with Borrower (and any of its Affiliates) as if it were not acting
as Agent; and Agent may accept fees and other consideration from Borrower (in addition to the fees
heretofore agreed to between Borrower and Agent) for services in connection with this Agreement or
otherwise without having to account for the same to the Lenders.



Section 10.6 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify Agent (to the extent not
reimbursed under Section 11.3 or Section 11.4 hereof, but without limiting the
obligations of Borrower under said Sections 11.3 and 11.4), ratably in accordance
with the Lenders’ respective Commitments (or, after termination of the Commitments, ratably in
accordance with the Loans held by them, respectively), for any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind
and nature whatsoever, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which Borrower is obligated to pay under
Sections 11.3 and 11.4 hereof, interest, penalties, attorneys’ fees and amounts
paid in settlement, but excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing, normal
administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of its agency duties hereunder) or
the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents; provided that
no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified. The obligations of the Lenders
under this Section 10.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment
of the Obligations.



Section 10.7 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender agrees that it has
received current financial information with respect to Borrower that it has, independently and
without reliance on Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of Borrower and decision to enter into this
Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make
its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this

















Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. Agent shall not be required to keep itself
informed as to the performance or observance by Borrower of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the
Properties or books of any Person. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by Agent hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of any Person which may
come into the possession of Agent.




Section 10.8 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of Agent hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents, Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or
refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its
satisfaction by the Lenders of their indemnification obligations under Section 10.6 hereof
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.



Section 10.9 Resignation or Removal of Agent. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, Agent may resign at any time by giving notice
thereof to the Lenders and Borrower, and Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by
the Majority Lenders; provided, that Agent shall continue as Agent until such time as any successor
shall have accepted appointment as Agent hereunder. Upon any such resignation or removal, (i) the
Majority Lenders with the consent of Borrower unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent so long as such successor Agent is
also a Lender at the time of such appointment and (ii) the Majority Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent that is not a Lender at the time of such appointment so long as Borrower
consents to such appointment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and accepted such appointment within 30
days after the retiring Agent’s giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders’ removal of
the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Agent. Any successor Agent shall be a bank which has an office in the United States and a combined
capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and the retiring Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under any other Loan Documents.
Such successor Agent shall promptly specify by notice to Borrower its Principal Office referred to
in Section 3.1 and Section 4 hereof. After any retiring Agent’s resignation or
removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 shall continue in effect for
its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
Agent.



Section 10.10 No Partnership. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor any of the other Loan Documents nor any interest the Lenders, Agent or any of them may now or
hereafter have in all or any part of the Obligations shall create or be construed as creating a
partnership, joint venture or other joint enterprise between the Lenders or among the Lenders and
Agent. The relationship between the Lenders, on the one hand, and Agent, on the other, is and
shall be that of principals and agent only, and nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents shall be construed to constitute Agent as trustee or other fiduciary for any Lender or to
impose on Agent any duty, responsibility or obligation other than those expressly provided for
herein and therein.


















Section 10.11 Authority of Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that the rights and
responsibilities of Agent under this Agreement and the Loan Documents with respect to any action
taken by Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by Agent of any option, right, request, judgment or
other right or remedy provided for herein or resulting or arising out of this Agreement and/or the
other Loan Documents shall, as between Agent and the Lenders, be governed by this Agreement and by
such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as
between Agent and Borrower, Agent shall be conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the
Lenders with full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting; and Borrower shall not be
under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such authority.



SECTION 11. Miscellaneous.




Section 11.1 Waiver. No waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall be a waiver
of any other Default or Event of Default. No failure on the part of Agent or any Lender to
exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or
privilege under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege thereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies provided in the Loan
Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity.



Section 11.2 Notices. All notices and other communications provided for herein
(including, without limitation, any modifications of, or waivers or consents under, this Agreement)
shall be given or made by telegraph, telecopy (confirmed by mail), cable or other writing and
telecopied, telegraphed, cabled, mailed or delivered to the intended recipient at the “Address for
Notices” specified below its name on the signature pages hereof (or provided for in an Assignment
and Acceptance); or, as to any party hereto, at such other address as shall be designated by such
party in a notice (given in accordance with this Section) (i) as to Borrower, to Agent, (ii) as to
Agent, to Borrower and to each Lender, and (iii) as to any Lender, to Borrower and Agent. Except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all such notices or communications shall be deemed to have
been duly given when (i) transmitted by electronic mail, telecopier or delivered to the telegraph
or cable office, (ii) personally delivered (iii) one Business Day after deposit with a nationally
recognized overnight mail or delivery service, postage prepaid or (iv) three Business Days’ after
deposit in a receptacle maintained by the United States Postal Service, postage prepaid, registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.



Section 11.3 Expenses, Etc. Whether or not any Loan is ever made, Borrower shall pay
or reimburse within 10 Business Days after written demand (a) Agent for paying the reasonable fees
and expenses of legal counsel to Agent, together with the reasonable fees and expenses of each
local counsel to Agent, in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of
this Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the other Loan Documents and the
making of the Loans, and any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the terms of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) Agent for any reasonable and customary lien search fees;
(c) Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the preparation,
documentation of the Loans or any of the Loan Documents; (d) Agent for paying all transfer, stamp,
documentary or other similar taxes, assessments or charges levied by any governmental or revenue
authority in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other document referred to
herein or therein, and (e) following the occurrence

















and during the continuation of an Event of Default, any Lender or Agent for paying all amounts
reasonably expended, advanced or incurred by such Lender or Agent to satisfy any obligation of
Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to collect the Obligations or to enforce,
protect, preserve or defend the rights of the Lenders or Agent under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, including, without limitation, fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
Lender’s or Agent’s participation as a member of a creditor’s committee in a case commenced with
Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or other similar
law, fees and expenses incurred in connection with lifting the automatic stay prescribed in Section
362 of the Bankruptcy Code and fees and expenses incurred in connection with any action pursuant to
Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code and all other reasonable and customary out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such Lender or Agent in connection with such matters, together with interest thereon at
the Past Due Rate on each such amount from the due date until the date of reimbursement to such
Lender or Agent.




Section 11.4 Indemnification. Borrower shall indemnify each of Agent, the Lenders,
and each affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from, and
hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any
of them may become subject, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF
ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise out of or
result from any (i) actual or proposed use by Borrower of the proceeds of any extension of credit
(whether a Loan) by any Lender hereunder; (ii) breach by Borrower of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document; (iii) violation by Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Legal
Requirement, or (iv) investigation, litigation or other proceeding relating to any of the
foregoing, and Borrower shall reimburse Agent, each Lender, and each Affiliate thereof and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand for any reasonable and customary
expenses (including reasonable and customary legal fees) incurred in connection with any such
investigation or proceeding; provided, however, that Borrower shall not have any obligations
pursuant to this Section with respect to any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses
incurred by the Person seeking indemnification by reason of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of that Person or with respect to any disputes between or among any of Agent and
Lenders. Nothing in this Section is intended to limit the obligations of Borrower under any other
provision of this Agreement. In the case of any indemnification hereunder, Agent or the respective
Lender, as appropriate, shall give written notice to Borrower of any such claim or demand being
made against an indemnified person and Borrower shall have the non-exclusive right to join in the
defense against any such claim or demand, provided that if Borrower provides a defense, the
indemnified person shall bear its own cost of defense unless there is a conflict of interests
between Borrower and such indemnified person. No Indemnified Person may settle any claim to be
indemnified without the consent of Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.



Section 11.5 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or modification of this Agreement, the
Notes or any other Loan Document shall in any event be effective against Borrower unless the same
shall be agreed or consented to in writing by such Person. No amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor any consent to any
departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective against the Lenders unless the
same shall be agreed or consented to in writing by the Majority Lenders, and each such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
given; provided, that no amendment, modification, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by each Lender affected thereby, do any of the following: (a)

















increase any Commitment of any of the Lenders (or reinstate any termination or reduction of
the Commitments) or subject any of the Lenders to any additional obligations; (b) reduce the
principal of, or interest on, any Loan or fee hereunder; (c) postpone or extend the Maturity Date
or any scheduled date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Loan, fee or other
sum to be paid hereunder or waive any Event of Default described in Section 9.1(a) hereof;
(d) change the percentage of any of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
any of the Loans, or the percentage of Lenders, which shall be required for the Lenders or any of
them to take any action under this Agreement, or (e) change any provision contained in Sections
7.9, 11.3 or 11.4 hereof or this Section 11.5. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 11.5 to the contrary, no amendment, modification, waiver or
consent shall be made with respect to Section 10 without the consent of Agent to the extent
it affects Agent, as Agent.




Section 11.6 Successors and Assigns.



(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder, other
than as permitted by Section 8.5 hereof, without the prior written consent of each Lender
and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except
(i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section,
(ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Section or
(iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of
paragraph (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto
shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the
extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agent and the Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.




(b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and
the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire
remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in
the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect
to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the principal
outstanding balance of the Loan of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined
as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Acceptance, as of the Trade Date)
shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consent (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Loan or the Commitment assigned; (iii) except in the case of an assignment to a
Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, any assignment of
a Commitment must be approved by the Agent and, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Borrower (each such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (iv)
the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, at least five days prior to
the proposed





















effective date of such assignment, an Assignment and Acceptance in substantially the form of
Exhibit D hereto (each an “Assignment and Acceptance”), together with a processing and
recordation fee of $3,000, and the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to
the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the
Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and after the “Effective Date” specified in
each Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, except for
any assigning Lender assigning to an Affiliate or an Approved Fund for which (so long as no Event
of Default shall have occurred or is continuing) the Borrower shall not have consented, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the
assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.3(c)(ii),
3.3(c)(iv), 11.4 and 4.1(E) with respect to facts and circumstances
occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender
of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be
treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section, subject to compliance with the
requirements of such paragraph (d).




(c) The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at
one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal
amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
“Register”). The entries in the Register, in the absence of manifest error, shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.




(d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the
Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the
Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such
Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agent and
the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to
which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification
or waiver described in clauses (a) through (e) of Section 11.5 that affects such
Participant. Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.3(c)(ii), 3.3(c)(iv) and
4.1(e) to the same extent (but only to the extent of its transferor Lender) as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its





















interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.2 as though it
were a Lender (but only to the extent of its transferor Lender), provided such Participant agrees
to be subject to Section 4.5 as though it were a Lender.




(e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections
3.3(c)(ii) and 4.1(e) than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive
with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant which is
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall not be entitled to the
benefits of Section 4.1(e) unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to
such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
Section 11.13 as though it were a Lender.




(f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation
any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no
such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.




Section 11.7 Limitation of Interest. The parties hereto intend to strictly comply
with all applicable federal and Texas laws, including applicable usury laws (or the usury laws of
any jurisdiction whose usury laws are deemed to apply to the Notes or any other Loan Documents).
Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 11.7 shall govern and control over every other
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this
Section, even if such provision declares that it controls. As used in this Section, the term
“interest” includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other compensation which
constitute interest under applicable law, provided that, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as
compensation for something other than the use, forbearance or detention of money and not as
interest, and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be
amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, in equal parts during the full term of the Obligations.
In no event shall Borrower or any other Person be obligated to pay, or Agent or any Lender have any
right or privilege to reserve, receive or retain, (a) any interest in excess of the maximum amount
of nonusurious interest permitted under the laws of the State of Texas or the applicable laws (if
any) of the United States or of any other jurisdiction, or (b) total interest in excess of the
amount which such Person could lawfully have contracted for, reserved, received, retained or
charged had the interest been calculated for the full term of the Obligations at the Ceiling Rate.
The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Ceiling Rate shall be determined
by dividing the applicable Ceiling Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for
which such calculation is being made. None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement
or in any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, Section 9.1 hereof) which
directly or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be construed without reference to this
Section 11.7, or be construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or
detention of money at an interest rate in excess of the Ceiling Rate. If the term of any
Obligation is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of any Default or by any
other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted prepayment, and if for that (or any other)
reason Agent or any Lender at any time, including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed
or receives (and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Ceiling Rate,
then and in any

















such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of
such acceleration, prepayment or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess
interest has been paid to such Person, it shall be credited pro tanto against the then-outstanding
principal balance of Borrower’s obligations to such Person, effective as of the date or dates when
the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of
such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance
of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.




Section 11.8 Survival. The obligations of Borrower under Sections 7.9,
11.3 and 11.4 hereof and all other obligations of Borrower in any other Loan
Document (to the extent stated therein) and the obligations of the Lenders under Sections
4.1(e), 10.6, 11.7, 11.13 and 11.16 hereof, shall,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, survive the repayment of the Loans and the
termination of the Commitments.



Section 11.9 Captions. Captions and section headings appearing herein are included
solely for convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement.



Section 11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement and any of
the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.



Section 11.11 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND (EXCEPT AS THEREIN PROVIDED) THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FROM TIME TO TIME IN EFFECT.



Section 11.12 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of the Loan Documents
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. If any
provision of any Loan Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any
applicable law, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of such Loan
Document shall not be affected or impaired thereby.



Section 11.13 Tax Forms. Each Lender which is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall, on the day of the initial borrowing from each such
Lender hereunder and from time to time thereafter if requested by Borrower or Agent, provide Agent
and Borrower with the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States
certifying as to such Lender’s status for purposes of determining exemption from United States
withholding taxes with respect to all payments to be made to such Lender hereunder or other
documents satisfactory to such Lender, Borrower and Agent indicating that all payments to be made
to such Lender hereunder are not subject to United States withholding tax or are subject to such
tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty. If a Lender determines, as a result of any
change in either (i) applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any official application thereof
or (ii) its circumstances, that it is unable to submit any form or certificate that it is obligated
to submit pursuant to this Section, or that it is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or
certificate previously submitted, it shall promptly notify Borrower and Agent of such fact. Unless
Borrower and Agent shall have received such forms or such documents indicating that payments
hereunder are not subject to United States withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate
reduced by an applicable tax treaty, Borrower or Agent shall withhold taxes from such

















payments at the applicable statutory rate. Each Lender agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
from any United States taxes, penalties, interest and other expenses, costs and losses incurred or
payable by (i) Agent as a result of such Lender’s failure to submit any form or certificate that it
required to provide pursuant to this Section or (ii) Borrower or Agent as a result of their
reliance on any representation, form or certificate which such Lender has provided to them pursuant
to this Section.




Section 11.14 Conflicts Between This Agreement and the Other Loan Documents. In the
event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any of the other Loan
Documents, the terms of this Agreement shall control.



Section 11.15 Limitation on Charges; Substitute Lenders; Non-Discrimination. Anything
in Sections 3.3(c) or 7.9 notwithstanding:



(a) Borrower shall not be required to pay to any Lender reimbursement or indemnification with
regard to any costs or expenses described in such Sections, unless such Lender notifies Borrower of
such costs or expenses within 90 days after the date paid or incurred;




(b) none of the Lenders shall be permitted to pass through to Borrower charges and costs under
such Sections on a discriminatory basis (i.e., which are not also passed through by such Lender to
other customers of such Lender similarly situated where such customer is subject to documents
providing for such pass through); and




(c) if any Lender elects to pass through to Borrower any material charge or cost under such
Sections or elects to terminate the availability of LIBOR Borrowings for any material period of
time, Borrower may, within 60 days after the date of such event and so long as no Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, elect to terminate such Lender as a party to this Agreement;
provided that, concurrently with such termination Borrower shall (i) if Agent and each of the other
Lenders shall consent, pay that Lender all principal, interest and fees and other amounts owed to
such Lender through such date of termination or (ii) have arranged for another financial
institution approved by Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) as of such
date, to become a substitute Lender for all purposes under this Agreement in the manner provided in
Section 11.6; provided further that, prior to substitution for any Lender, Borrower shall
have given written notice to Agent of such intention and the Lenders shall have the option, but no
obligation, for a period of 60 days after receipt of such notice, to increase their Commitments in
order to replace the affected Lender in lieu of such substitution.




Section 11.16 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to exercise its best efforts to
keep any information delivered or made available by Borrower which is clearly indicated to be
confidential information, confidential from anyone other than Persons employed or retained by such
Lender or any of its Affiliates who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving,
structuring or administering the Loans; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Lender from
disclosing such information (a) to any other Lender; (b) pursuant to subpoena or upon the order of
any court or administrative agency; (c) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency or
authority having jurisdiction over such Lender; (d) which has been publicly disclosed; (e) to the
extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which Agent, any Lender, Borrower
or their respective Affiliates may be a party; (f) to the extent reasonably required in connection
with the exercise of any remedy hereunder; (g) to such Lender’s bank

















counsel and independent auditors; and (h) to any actual or proposed participant or assignee of
all or part of its rights hereunder which has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of
this Section.




Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, “information” shall not include, and the Agent and
each Lender may disclose without limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the “tax
treatment” and “tax structure” (in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Agent or such Lender relating to such tax treatment
and tax structure; provided that with respect to any document or similar item that in either case
contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as well as
other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of the document or similar item
that relate to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Loans and transactions contemplated
hereby.

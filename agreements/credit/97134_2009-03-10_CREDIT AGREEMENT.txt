times to first priority, perfected Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent for
the benefit of the Secured Parties to secure the Secured Obligations in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents, subject
in any case to Liens permitted by Section 6.02. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company will cause the Applicable Pledge
Percentage of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each Pledge

documents as the Collateral Agent shall reasonably request. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Foreign Subsidiary that is a Loan Party shall be required
to grant such Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent until and unless so
reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent but subject to the exclusion of
Excluded Assets.













(b)          Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the Collateral

supplements or other modifications to the Pledge Agreements entered into
prior to the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date and (ii) the filing and recording
of financing statements and other documents and such other actions or
deliveries of the type required by Section 4.01, as applicable), which may be
required by law or which the Collateral Agent may, from time to time,
reasonably request to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and to ensure perfection and priority of the
Liens created or intended to be created by the Collateral Documents, all at
the expense of the Company.













(c)          If
any assets are acquired by a Loan Party after the Effective Date (other than
Excluded Assets and assets constituting Collateral under a Pledge Agreement
that automatically become subject to the Lien under such Pledge Agreement
upon acquisition thereof), the Company will notify the Collateral Agent
thereof, and, if requested by the Collateral Agent, the Company will cause
such assets to be subjected to a Lien securing the Secured Obligations and
will take, and cause the other Loan Parties to take, such actions as shall be
necessary or reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to grant and
perfect such Liens, including actions described in paragraph (c) of this
Section, all at the expense of the Company.

ANNEX
I


ARTICLE
VIII


The Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent


Each
of the Lenders (including the Holder of China Facility Guaranty Obligations)
and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent hereunder and under each other Loan
Document, and each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank authorizes each of the
Agents to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, on behalf of such Lender and
the Issuing Bank (each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby agreeing to be bound
by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, as if it were a party thereto) and
to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan
Documents, and on behalf of the Secured Parties and to exercise such powers as
are delegated to the Agents by the terms hereof and the terms of the other Loan
Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.


The
bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights
and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any
kind of business with Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as
if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.


No
Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be
subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a
Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to
take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent
is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances
as provided in Section 9.02) or as otherwise set forth in the Intercreditor
Agreement, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, no Agent shall have
any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as either Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity. No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or
not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or
such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of
any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by
the Company or a Lender, and neither shall be responsible for or have any duty
to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made
in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii)
the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other
terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document (other than the Intercreditor
Agreement) or other instrument or document, (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent or (vi) the
creation, perfection or priority of Liens on the Collateral or the existence of
the Collateral.


The
Agents shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for
relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument,
document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed
or sent by the proper Person. The Agents also may rely upon any statement made
to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper
Person, and









shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. The Agents may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.


Either
Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by
or through any one or more subagents appointed by such Agent. The Agents and
any such subagent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights
and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions
of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such subagent and to the Related
Parties of the Agents and any such subagent, and shall apply to their
respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as an Agent.


Subject
to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as
provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Company. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the approval of
the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to
appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after
the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the
retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing
Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office
in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of
its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by any Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between such Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent’s
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents
and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.


Each
Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon either
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon either Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or
based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.


None
of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Syndication Agent or
Co-Documentation Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall
have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender
hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders in
their respective capacities as Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agents, as
applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the
preceding paragraph.


In
its capacity, the Collateral Agent is a “representative” of the Secured Parties
within the meaning of the term “secured party” as defined in the New York
Uniform Commercial Code. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent authorizes
the Collateral Agent to enter into each of the Collateral Documents to which it
is a party and to take all action contemplated by such documents. Each Lender









agrees that no Secured
Parties (other than the Collateral Agent) shall have the right individually to
seek to realize upon the security granted by any Pledge Agreement, it being
understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised solely by
the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties upon the terms of
the Collateral Documents. In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged
by any Person as collateral security for the Secured Obligations, the
Collateral Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of attorney,
to execute and deliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any Loan Documents
necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien on such Collateral in
favor of the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties. The Lenders and
the Administrative Agent hereby authorize the Collateral Agent, at its option
and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Collateral
Agent upon any Collateral (i) as permitted by, but only in accordance with, the
terms of the applicable Loan Document; or (ii) if approved, authorized or
ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, unless such release is required to
be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request by the Collateral
Agent at any time, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent will confirm in
writing the Collateral Agent’s authority to release particular types or items
of Collateral pursuant hereto. Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting
Collateral which is permitted pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document, or
consented to in writing by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as
applicable, and upon at least five Business Days’ prior written request by the
Company to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to) execute
such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted
to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties herein or
pursuant hereto upon the Collateral that was sold or transferred; provided,
however,
that (i) the Collateral Agent shall not be required to execute any such
document on terms which, in the Collateral Agent’s opinion, would expose the
Collateral Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any
consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty,
and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the
Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary
in respect of) all interests retained by the Company or any Subsidiary,
including (without limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall
continue to constitute part of the Collateral.


In
connection with a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower organized under the laws of
England and Wales (a “UK Borrower”), each Lender (i) irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent to act as syndicate manager under, and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to operate, and take any action necessary
or desirable under, the Provisional Treaty Relief scheme as described in the
United Kingdom’s Inland Revenue Guidelines dated January 2003 and administered
by the United Kingdom’s H.M. Revenue & Custom’s Centre for Non-Residents
(the “PTR Scheme”) in connection with this Agreement, (ii) shall
co-operate with the Administrative Agent in completing any procedural
formalities necessary under the PTR Scheme, and shall promptly supply to the
Administrative Agent such information as the Administrative Agent may request
in connection with the operation of the PTR Scheme and (iii) without limiting
the liability of any UK Borrower under this Agreement, shall, within 5 Business
Days of demand, indemnify the Administrative Agent for any liability or loss
incurred by the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent
acting as syndicate manager under the PTR Scheme in connection with such
Lender’s participation in any Loan (except to the extent that the liability or
loss arises directly from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or
willful misconduct). Each UK Borrower acknowledges that it is fully aware of
its contingent obligations under the PTR Scheme and shall promptly supply to
the Administrative Agent such information as the Administrative Agent may
request in connection with the operation of the PTR Scheme and act in
accordance with any provisional notice issued by the UK Inland Revenue under
the PTR Scheme. The Administrative Agent agrees to provide, as soon as
reasonably practicable, a copy of any provisional authority issued to it under
the PTR Scheme in connection with any Loan to any UK Borrower. All parties
hereto acknowledge that (i) the Administrative Agent is entitled to rely
completely upon information provided to it in connection with this paragraph,
(ii) is not obliged to undertake any enquiry into the accuracy of such
information, nor into the taxation status of any Lender or,









as the case may be, any
UK Borrower providing such information and (iii) shall have no liability to any
person for the accuracy of any information it submits in connection with this
paragraph.


Each
Borrower, on its behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, and each Lender, on
its behalf and on the behalf of its affiliated Secured Parties, hereby
irrevocably constitute the Collateral Agent as the holder of an irrevocable
power of attorney (fondé de pouvoir within the meaning of
Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Québec) in order to hold hypothecs and
security granted by each Borrower or any Subsidiary on property pursuant to the
laws of the Province of Quebec to secure obligations of any Borrower or any
Subsidiary under any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness issued by
any Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement, and agree
that the Collateral Agent may act as the bondholder and mandatary with respect
to any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness that may be issued by
any Borrower or any Subsidiary and pledged in favor of the Secured Parties in
connection with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32 of
the An Act respecting the special powers of legal persons (Quebec), JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association as Collateral Agent may acquire and be the
holder of any bond issued by any Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with
this Agreement (i.e., the fondé de pouvoir may acquire and hold the
first bond issued under any deed of hypothec by any Borrower or any
Subsidiary).


The
Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to execute and deliver any documents
necessary or appropriate to create and perfect the rights of pledge for the
benefit of the Secured Parties including a right of pledge with respect to the
entitlements to profits, the balance left after winding up and the voting
rights of the Company as ultimate parent of any subsidiary of the Company which
is organized under the laws of the Netherlands and the Equity Interests of
which are pledged in connection herewith (a “Dutch Pledge”). Without
prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of parallel debt
obligations of the Company or any relevant Subsidiary as will be described in
any Dutch Pledge (the “Parallel Debt”), including that any payment
received by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt will -
conditionally upon such payment not subsequently being avoided or reduced by
virtue of any provisions or enactments relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
preference, liquidation or similar laws of general application - be deemed a
satisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Secured
Obligations, and any payment to the Secured Parties in satisfaction of the
Secured Obligations shall - conditionally upon such payment not subsequently
being avoided or reduced by virtue of any provisions or enactments relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, preference, liquidation or similar laws of general
application - be deemed as satisfaction of the corresponding amount of the
Parallel Debt. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of a
Dutch Pledge, any resignation by the Collateral Agent is not effective until
its rights under the Parallel Debt are assigned to the successor Collateral
Agent.


The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree for the purposes of taking and ensuring
the continuing validity of German law governed pledges (Pfandrechte) with the
creation of parallel debt obligations of the Borrowers as will be further
described in a separate German law governed parallel debt undertaking. The
Collateral Agent shall (i) hold such parallel debt undertaking as fiduciary
agent (Treuhaender)
and (ii) administer and hold as fiduciary agent (Treuhaender) any pledge
created under a German law governed Collateral Document which is created in
favor of any Secured Party or transferred to any Secured Party due to its
accessory nature (Akzessorietaet), in each case in its own name and for the
account of the Secured Parties. Each Lender, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its affiliated Secured Parties, hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to enter
as its agent in its name and on its behalf into any German law governed
Collateral Document, to accept as its agent in its name and on its behalf any
pledge under such Collateral Document and to agree to and execute as agent its
in its name and on its behalf any amendments, supplements and other alterations
to any such Collateral Document and to release any such Collateral Document and
any pledge created under any such Collateral Document in accordance with the
provisions herein and/or the provisions in any such Collateral Document.









No
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Collateral Agent without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent.

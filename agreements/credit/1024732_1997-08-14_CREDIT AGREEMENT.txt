at any one time outstanding.

2.1b    Commitments of the Lenders.  Each Lender severally agrees, for itself
only, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make
Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrower from time to time not to exceed an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding equal to such Lender's
Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Credit Commitment; provided, however,
that in no event shall any Lender be required to advance an amount in excess of
its Commitment with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans; and provided,
further, that if any Lender fails to advance to the Borrower its Commitment
Percentage of any Revolving Credit Loan, the remaining Lenders shall not be

Payments.

(i) Voluntary Reductions.  Upon two Business Days' written notice to the
Agent, the Borrower may from time to time voluntarily permanently reduce the
Revolving Credit Commitment.  Each voluntary reduction shall be in a minimum
amount of $5,000,000 or, if greater than $5,000,000, in integral multiples of
$1,000,000.

(ii) Effect of Reductions.  Simultaneously with each voluntary permanent

Loans equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Revolving Credit Loans over (B) the Revolving Credit Commitment, as
so reduced.  Notice of a reduction, once given, shall be irrevocable.  All such
reductions shall be without penalty or premium (except for amounts owing
pursuant to Section 2.3e(iv), if any).

(iii)  Application of Reductions and Payments.  Any principal payments
shall be accompanied by all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, all amounts due
pursuant to Section 2.3, if any, and, in the case of a permanent reduction of
the Revolving Credit Commitment to zero, any other outstanding Obligations which

minimum amount of $200,000.  Each Euro-Rate Loan shall be in a minimum amount of

2.2    [Reserved].

2.3    Interest.

2.3a   Interest Rates.

Revolving Credit Loans.  During the term hereof the Borrower, in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 2.3, shall have the option of electing from
time to time one or more of the Interest Rate Options to be applied by the
Lenders to outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, as follows:  interest (i) under
the Prime Rate Option shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate,
and (ii) under the Euro-Rate Option shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to
the sum of (A) the Euro-Rate plus (B) 1.0 percent (100 basis points).

2.3b    Adjustments to Interest Rates.

(i) Changes in Prime Rate.  The Prime Rate Option shall be adjusted from
time to time, without notice to the Borrower, as necessary to reflect any
changes in the Prime Rate, which adjustments shall be automatically effective on
the day of any such change.
<PAGE>

(ii) Changes in Euro-Rate Reserve Percentage.  The Euro-Rate shall be
adjusted from time to time, with respect to Revolving Credit Loans, without
notice to the Borrower, as necessary to reflect any changes in the Euro-Rate
Reserve Percentage, which adjustments shall be automatically effective on the
day of such change.

(iii)  Event of Default.  Upon the occurrence of and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, (A) the outstanding principal amount of all Revolving
Credit Loans shall bear interest from the date of such occurrence at a rate per
annum which is equal to the sum of the Prime Rate plus two percent (2%).

2.3c    Interest Rate Option Elections, Renewals and Conversions.  Subject to
the remaining provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower shall have the option
to elect to have all or any Revolving Credit Loans bear interest at either of
the Interest Rate Options and shall have the right to renew elections of
Interest Rate Options and convert Revolving Credit Loans to other Interest Rate
Options.  Notice of the Borrower's election shall be made in accordance with
Section 2.5.  Elections of, conversions to or renewals of the Prime Rate Option
shall continue in effect until converted to the Euro-Rate Option.  Elections of,
conversions to or renewals of the Euro-Rate Option shall expire as to each such
Euro-Rate Option at the expiration of the applicable Euro-Rate Interest Period.
Any Revolving Credit Loans outstanding for which no elections have been made
shall bear interest under the Prime Rate Option.

2.3d    Limitation on Election of Euro-Rate Options.  Each election of the Euro-
Rate Option or the prepayment of all or any Euro-Rate Loans shall be in the
minimum principal amount of $500,000 or, if in excess of $500,000, in integral
multiples of $100,000.  At no time during the term hereof may there be more than
a total of six (6) separate Euro-Rate Interest Periods in effect.  Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrower's
right to elect, renew or convert to Euro-Rate Loans shall be suspended.

2.3e    Special Provisions Relating to Euro-Rate Option.

(i) Euro-Rate Unascertainable.  In the event that on any date on which a
Euro-Rate would otherwise be set the Agent shall have determined in good faith
(which determination shall be final and conclusive) that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the London interbank market, adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Euro-Rate, the Agent shall give prompt
notice of such determination to the Borrower and the other Lenders, and until
the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
determination no longer exist, the right of the Borrower to borrow under, renew
or convert to the Euro-Rate Option shall be treated as a request to borrow
under, renew or convert to the Prime Rate Option.

(ii) Illegality of Offering Euro-Rate.  If the Agent shall determine in
good faith, which determination shall be final and conclusive, that compliance
by the Agent or any Lender with any applicable Governmental Rule (whether or not
having the force of law), or
<PAGE>

the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority has made
it unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Euro-Rate Loans, the Agent shall
give notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, unless and
until the Agent shall give notice to the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such determination no longer apply:

(A) with respect to any Euro-Rate Interest Periods thereafter commencing,
interest on the corresponding Euro-Rate Loans shall be computed and payable
under the Prime Rate Option; and

(B) on such date, if any, as shall be required by law, any Euro-Rate Loans
then outstanding shall be automatically renewed at the Prime Rate Option; and
the Borrower shall pay to the Lenders the accrued and unpaid interest on such
Euro-Rate Loans to (but not including) such renewal date.

The Borrower shall pay the Lenders any additional amounts reasonably necessary
to compensate the Lenders (on an after-tax basis) for any out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Lenders as a result of any renewal pursuant to item (B) above on
a day other than the last day of the relevant Euro-Rate Interest Period,
including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by the Lenders to
lenders of funds obtained by them to loan or maintain the Revolving Credit Loans
so converted.  The Lenders shall furnish to the Borrower a certificate showing
the calculation of the amount necessary to compensate the Lenders (on an after-
tax basis) for such costs (which certificate, in the absence of manifest error,
shall be conclusive), and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Lenders, as
additional consideration hereunder, within ten (10) days of the Borrower's
receipt of such certificate.

(iii)  Inability to Offer Euro-Rate.  In the event that a Lender shall
determine, in its sole discretion, that it is unable to obtain deposits in the
London interbank market in sufficient amounts and with maturities related to the
Euro-Rate Loans which would enable such Lender to fund such Euro-Rate Loans,
then such Lender shall immediately notify the Agent.  The Agent shall then
notify the Borrower that the right of the Borrower to borrow under, convert to
or renew the Euro-Rate Option shall be suspended.  Following notification of the
suspension of the Euro-Rate Option, the Borrower shall negotiate with the
affected Lender for a modified Euro-Rate which will allow such Lender to realize
its anticipated and bargained-for yield.  In the event that the Borrower and the
affected Lender cannot agree on a modified Euro-Rate, any notice of borrowing
under, conversion to or renewal of the Euro-Rate Option which was to become
effective during the period of suspension shall be treated as a request to
borrow under, convert to or renew the Prime Rate Option with respect to the
principal amount specified therein.

(iv) Indemnity.  In addition to the other provisions of this Section 2.3e,
the Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and the Lenders against any
loss or expense which the Agent or any Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of any default by the Borrower in failing to make any borrowing,
conversion or renewal hereunder to bear interest at the Euro-Rate Option on the
scheduled date, in failing to make when due (whether by
<PAGE>

declaration, acceleration or otherwise) any payment of any Euro-Rate Loan or in
making any payment or prepayment of any Euro-Rate Loan or any part thereof on
any day other than the last day of the relevant Euro-Rate Interest Period,
including but not limited to any loss of profit, premium or penalty incurred by
the Agent or any Lender in respect of funds borrowed by it for the purpose of
making or maintaining any Euro-Rate Loan as determined in good faith by the
Agent or any Lender in the exercise of its sole but reasonable discretion. The
affected Lender shall furnish to the Borrower a certificate showing the
calculation of the amount of any such loss or expense (which certificate, absent
manifest error, shall be conclusive), and the Borrower shall pay such amount to
the affected Lender within ten (10) days of the Borrower' receipt of such
certificate.

2.3f    Yield Protection.  If any Governmental Rule or the interpretation or
application thereof by any court, any Governmental Authority charged with the
administration thereof or the compliance with any guideline or request from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority, whether or not having the force of
law:

(i) subjects the Agent or any Lender to any tax, levy, impost, charge, fee,
duty, deduction or withholding of any kind hereunder (other than any tax imposed
or based upon the income of the Agent or such Lender and payable to any
Governmental Authority or taxing authority of the United States of America or
any state thereof) or changes the basis of taxation of the Agent or any Lender
with respect to payments by the Borrower or principal, interest or other amounts
due from the Borrower hereunder (other than any change which affects, and to the
extent that it affects, the taxation by the United States of America or any
state thereof of the total net income of the Agent or such Lender); or

(ii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit,
special assessment or similar requirements against assets held by, deposits with
or for the account of or credit extended by the Agent or any Lender with respect
to loans to the Borrower (other than such requirements which are included in the
determination of the Euro-Rate hereunder); or

(iii)  imposes upon the Agent or any Lender any other condition with
respect to this Agreement;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Agent or
the affected Lender, reduce the income receivable by the Agent or such Lender,
reduce the rate of return on the Agent's or such Lender's capital or impose any
expense upon the Agent or such Lender by an amount which the Agent or such
Lender in its sole but reasonable discretion deems to be material, the Agent or
the affected Lender shall from time to time notify the Agent of the amount
determined by such Lender (which determination, absent manifest error, shall be
conclusive) to be reasonably necessary to compensate the Agent or such Lender
(on an after-tax basis) for such increase in cost, reduction in income,
reduction in rate of return or additional expense, and setting forth the
calculations therefor, and the Agent shall thereupon notify the Borrower.  The
Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent or the
<PAGE>

affected Lender, as additional consideration hereunder, within ten (10) days of
the Borrower' receipt of such notice from the Agent.

2.3g    Method of Calculation.  In determining the amount due the Agent and the
Lenders hereunder by reason of the application of this Section 2.3, the Agent
and the Lenders may use any reasonable averaging or attribution method;
provided, however, that the Agent and each Lender must use reasonable efforts to
minimize such losses and costs.

2.3h    Interest Payment Dates.  Interest due on all outstanding Prime Rate
Loans shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each month for
the month just ended, beginning on June 30, 1997.  Interest due on all
outstanding Euro-Rate Loans and Prime Rate Loans shall be payable on the last
day of each Euro-Rate Interest Period and, for Euro-Rate Interest Periods of
six, nine, and twelve months, also on the day which is three months after the
first day of such Euro-Rate Interest Period.  All accrued and unpaid interest on
the Revolving Credit Loans shall be due and payable on the Revolving Credit
Termination Date and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Prime Rate Loans
shall be due and payable on the last day of the applicable Prime Rate Interest
Period.  In addition, all accrued and unpaid interest on all of the Obligations
shall be due and payable after any maturity of the Notes or the Obligations,
whether by acceleration or otherwise, on demand until all amounts due hereunder
are paid in full.

2.3i    Calculation of Interest.  Interest under the Prime Rate Option shall be
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed, using a year of
365 or 366 days, as the case may be.  Interest under the Euro-Rate Option shall
be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed, using a year of
360 days.  Interest for any period shall be calculated from and including the
first day thereof to but not including the last day thereof.

2.4    Capital Adequacy.  If (i) any adoption of, change in or interpretation
of any Governmental Rule, or (ii) compliance with any guideline, request or
directive of any central bank or other Governmental Authority or quasi-
Governmental Authority exercising control over banks or financial institutions
generally, including but not limited to regulations set forth at 12 C.F.R. Part
3 (Appendix A), 12 C.F.R. Part 208 (Appendix A), 12 C.F.R. Part 225 (Appendix A)
and 12 C.F.R. Part 325 (Appendix A) or any court requires that the commitments
of any Lender hereunder be treated as an asset or otherwise be included for
purposes of calculating the appropriate amount of capital to be maintained by
such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender (a "Capital Adequacy
Event"), the result of which is to reduce the rate of return on such Lender's
capital as a consequence of such commitments to a level below that which such
Lender could have achieved but for such Capital Adequacy Event, taking into
consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy, by an
amount which such Lender deems to be material, such Lender shall promptly
deliver to the Agent and the Borrower a certificate of the amount necessary to
compensate such Lender for the reduction in the rate of return on its capital
attributable to such commitments (the "Capital Compensation Amount"), calculated
in good faith, using reasonable attribution and averaging methods, which
certificate, absent manifest error, shall
<PAGE>

be presumed to be correct. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrower
to the affected Lender ten (10) days after such notice is given.

2.5    Requests for Revolving Credit Loans, Interest Rate Options and
Conversions.  Each request for a Revolving Credit Loan and for the election or
renewal of or conversion to an Interest Rate Option shall be made to the Agent
orally or in writing by an Authorized Officer no later than 12:00 noon (Eastern
time) (i) at least one (1) Business Day prior thereto, with respect to Prime
Rate Loans and (ii) at least three (3) Business Days prior thereto, with respect
to Euro-Rate Loans. Any oral request for a Revolving Credit Loan shall be
followed immediately by the Borrower's written confirmation of such request,
executed by an Authorized Officer, which confirmation must set forth the amount
and date of the Revolving Credit Loan, the Interest Rate Option selected and, if
applicable, the Euro-Rate Interest Period being selected and which shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit "B". A request from the Borrower pursuant
to this Section 2.5 with respect to a Euro-Rate Loan shall irrevocably commit
the Borrower to accept such Euro-Rate Loan on the date specified in such
request. The Agent shall notify the Lenders of (i) each request for a Prime Rate
Loan as soon as practicable, but not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the
date on which such Prime Rate Loan is to be made, and (ii) each request for a
Euro-Rate Loan as soon as practicable, but not later than 12:00 noon (Eastern
time) two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which such Euro-Rate Loan is to
be made. Each Lender shall make its Commitment Percentage of such Revolving
Credit Loan available to the Borrower in immediately available funds at the
principal office of the Agent prior to 12:00 noon (Eastern time) on the date
such Revolving Credit Loan is to be made.

2.6    Method of Disbursements and Payments.  All Revolving Credit Loans shall
be made by the Agent by making a deposit into Borrower's demand deposit account
maintained with the Agent. All payments of principal, interest, Fees, costs and
other amounts due hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be made by
the Borrower to the Agent at the Agent's principal office at One PNC Plaza, 249
Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 15222 not later than 2:00 p.m. (Eastern
time) on the due date. All such Revolving Credit Loans and payments shall be
made in immediately available funds when either transferred by the Agent into
the Borrower's account with the Agent, or when delivered by the Borrower to the
Agent, as the case may be.

2.7    Loan Accounts.  Each Lender shall open and maintain on its books a Loan
Account in the Borrower's name with respect to Revolving Credit Loans made,
repayments, prepayments, the computation and payment of interest and other
amounts due and sums paid to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. Except in the case of manifest error in computation, such records
shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower as to the amount at any time due
to such Lender by the Borrower.

2.8    Payment From Accounts Maintained by Borrower.  In the event that any
payment of principal, interest, Fees, other expenses or amounts due the Lenders
or the Agent under any of the Loan Documents is not paid when due, including the
grace period applicable under Section 7.1a, the Agent is hereby authorized to
effect such payment by
<PAGE>

debiting any demand deposit account of any Borrower now or in the future
maintained with the Agent other than accounts maintained in trust for the
benefit of third parties. The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of the
date and amount of any such debit. This right to debit accounts of the Borrower
is in addition to any right of setoff accorded the Lenders hereunder or by
operation of law.

2.9    Commitment Fee.  Beginning on August 29, 1997, and continuing on the
last day of each calendar quarter thereafter until the Revolving Credit

unused portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment during the calendar quarter
then ended. The Commitment Fee shall be computed on the basis of the year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be, and paid on the actual number of days elapsed.
The Lenders shall be entitled to share the Commitment Fee based upon their pro-
rata share of the Revolving Credit Commitment.

Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as such
enforceability may be limited by the availability of equitable remedies.

3.6    No Conflict.  Neither the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents
by the Borrower, nor the consummation of the transactions herein or therein
contemplated or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or thereof by
them will conflict with, constitute a default under or result in any breach of
(i) the terms and conditions of the Borrower's articles or certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, or other organizational documents, (ii) any Governmental
Rule or (iii) any material agreement, instrument, order, writ, judgment,
injunction or decree, to which the Borrower is a party or by which it is bound
or to which it is subject, or will result in the creation or enforcement of any
Lien whatsoever upon any property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, of
any Borrower, except for Permitted Liens.

3.7    Financial Matters; No Material Adverse Change.  The Borrower has
delivered to the Lenders its unaudited quarterly financial statements for the
Fiscal Quarter ended September 30, 1996. Such financial statements are complete
and correct in all material respects, subject to year-end adjustments, and
fairly present the financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on
a consolidated basis, in all material respects and the results of its operations
as of the dates and for the periods referred to, and have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved. The
Borrower and its Subsidiaries have no material liabilities, whether direct or
indirect, fixed or contingent, and no liability for taxes, long-term leases or
unusual forward or long-term commitments as of the date of such financial
statements which are not reflected in such financial statements or in any notes

pending or, to the Borrower's knowledge, threatened against the Borrower or any
of its business, operations, properties, prospects, profits or condition
(financial or otherwise), at law or in equity, before any Governmental Authority
which, individually or in the aggregate, if adversely determined, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or which purport to
affect the rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or which purport to restrain or enjoin
(either temporarily, preliminarily or permanently) the performance by the
Borrower of any action contemplated by any of the Loan Documents. All pending
and, to the Borrower's
<PAGE>

knowledge, threatened actions, suits, proceedings and investigations affecting
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in existence on the Closing Date which
are material are set forth on Schedule 3.8.

3.9    Compliance with Laws. The Borrower has duly complied with, and its
properties, business operations and leaseholds are in compliance in all material
respects with all Governmental Rules applicable to it, its properties and the

Material Adverse Effect.

of each year.

3.11    Condition of and Title to Assets.  The Borrower has good title to its
properties and assets except for defects in title which, taken as a whole, are

the operation of its business are in good working condition, ordinary wear and
tear excepted, and are able to serve the functions for which they are currently
being used.

paid all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges levied upon its
properties, assets, income or franchises which are due and payable, other than
(i) those presently payable without penalty or interest, (ii) those which are
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and (iii) those which,
if not paid, would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; and as
to each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) the Borrower has set aside on its books
reserves for such claim as are determined to be adequate by application of GAAP
consistently applied. The charges, accruals, and reserves on the books of the
Borrower in respect of Federal, state, local and other taxes and assessments for
all fiscal periods to date are adequate, and the Borrower knows of no unpaid
assessments for additional Federal, state, local or other taxes for any such
fiscal period or any basis therefor.

3.13    Insurance.  The Borrower currently maintains insurance which meets or
exceeds the requirements of Section 4.8 hereof and such insurance is provided by
insurers meeting the requirements of Section 4.8 and is of such types and at
least in such amounts as are customarily carried by, and insures against such
risks as are customarily insured against by similar businesses similarly
situated and owning, leasing and operating similar properties to those owned,
leased and operated by the Borrower. All of such insurance policies are valid
and in full force and effect. No notice has been given or claim made and no
grounds exist to cancel or avoid any of such policies or to reduce the coverage
provided thereby.

3.14    Consents and Approvals.  No order, authorization, consent, license,
validation or approval of, or notice to, filing, recording, or registration with
any Governmental Authority, or the exemption by any such Governmental Authority,

performance of any of the Loan Documents or (ii) the legality, binding effect or
enforceability of any such Loan Document.

3.15    No Defaults.  No event has occurred and is continuing and no condition
exists or will exist after giving effect to the Loans to be made on the Closing
Date which constitutes a Default or an Event of Default. The Borrower is not in
violation of (i) any term or provision of its articles of incorporation, by-
laws, or other organizational documents or (ii) any material agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be
bound or subject, which violation would constitute a Material Adverse Change.

3.16    Plans and Benefit Arrangements.  Each Plan and Benefit Arrangement as
to which the Borrower may have any liability complies in all material respects
with all applicable provisions of ERISA, including minimum funding requirements,
and (i) no Prohibited Transaction has occurred with respect to any such Plan or
Benefit Arrangement, (ii) no Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any

no steps have been taken to terminate any such Plan or Benefit Arrangement.

outstanding under the Loan Documents will constitute senior Indebtedness of the
Borrower and will rank at least pari passu in priority of payment with all other
Indebtedness owed by the Borrower from time to time, except other Indebtedness
to the extent secured by Permitted Liens.

3.18    Environmental Matters.  To the best of the Borrower's knowledge the
Borrower is in material compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws. There
are no past, pending or, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, threatened
Environmental Claims against the Borrower or any of the property of the
Borrower, and there is no condition or occurrence on any property owned or
leased by the Borrower that could reasonably be anticipated (i) to form the
basis of an Environmental Claim against the Borrower, or its properties or (ii)
to cause any property owned or leased by the Borrower to be subject to any
restrictions on its ownership, occupancy or transferability under any
Environmental Law.

3.19    Margin Stock.  The Borrower is not engaged principally or as one of
its important activities in the business of extending credit for the purpose,
immediately, incidentally or ultimately, of purchasing or carrying margin stock
(within the meaning of Regulation U). No Loan will be used, immediately,
incidentally or ultimately, to purchase or carry any margin stock or to extend

"investment company", as those terms are defined in such Act, and shall not
become such an "investment company" or under such "control."

certificate or statement furnished to the Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of
the Borrower or any Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. There is no fact known

assets, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the Borrower
or any other Loan Party which has not been set forth in the Loan Documents or in
the other documents, certificates and statements (financial or otherwise)

other Loan Party prior to or on the date hereof in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

authorized to execute all of the Loan Documents (other than this Agreement) for
and on behalf of the Lenders and to accept all of the Loan Documents and all
other agreements, documents or instruments reasonably required to carry out the
intent of the parties to this Agreement.
<PAGE>

8.2    Non-Reliance on Agent.  Each Lender agrees that it has, independently
and without reliance on the Agent, and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries and its own independent decision to enter into this Agreement
and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Agent shall have
no duty to keep the Lenders informed as to the performance or observance by the
Loan Party of any Loan Document or to inspect the properties or books of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries. The Agent, in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct, shall not be liable to any Lender for its failure to relay
or furnish to the Lender any information.

8.3     Responsibility of Agents and Other Matters.

8.3a    Ministerial Nature of Duties.  As between the Lenders and itself, the
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set
forth in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, and those duties and
responsibilities shall be subject to the limitations and qualifications set
forth in this Article 8.  The duties of the Agent shall be ministerial and
administrative in nature.

8.3b    Limitation of Liability.  As between the Lenders and itself, neither the
Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable,
except for gross negligence or willful misconduct, for any action taken or
omitted (whether or not such action taken or omitted is within or without the
Agent's responsibilities and duties expressly set forth in this Agreement) under
or in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other
instrument or document in connection herewith.  Without limiting the foregoing,
neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, shall
be responsible for, or have any duty to examine (i) the genuineness, execution,
validity, effectiveness, enforceability, value or sufficiency of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents or any other document or instrument furnished
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement; (ii) the collectability of any
amounts owed by the Borrower to the Lenders; (iii) the truthfulness of any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made to the Agent or the
Lenders in connection with this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other
document or instrument furnished pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, (iv) any failure of any party to this Agreement to receive any
communication sent, including any telegram, telex, teletype, telecopy, bank

other instrument, paper or communication entrusted to the mails or to a delivery
service, or (v) the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, business, prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower, its
Subsidiaries, or any other Person.

8.3c    Reliance.  The Agent shall be entitled to act, and shall be fully
protected in acting upon, any telegram, telex, teletype, telecopy, bank wire,
cable or radiogram or any writing, application, notice, report, statement,
certificate, resolution, request, order, consent,
<PAGE>

letter, other instrument, paper or communication believed by the Agent in good
faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent or made by a
proper Person. The Agent may consult counsel and shall be entitled to act, and
shall be fully protected in any action taken in good faith, in accordance with
advice given by counsel. The Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and
shall not be liable for the default or misconduct of any such agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by the Agent with reasonable care. The Agent shall
not be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any
of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents on the part of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

8.4    Action on Instructions.  The Agent shall be entitled to act or refrain
from acting, and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting,
under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or
document in connection herewith or therewith, in accordance with written
instructions from the Required Lenders or, in the case of the matters set forth
in items (i) through (v) of Section 9.2, from all of the Lenders. For purposes
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, unless expressly stated
otherwise, all determinations by, requests by, or other references to "Lenders"
shall mean the Required Lenders.

8.5    Action Upon Occurrence of a Default or Event of Default.  If a Default
or Event of Default has occurred, the Lenders shall immediately consult
with one another in an attempt to agree upon a mutually acceptable course of
conduct.  In the absence of unanimous agreement upon a course of conduct, if the
Required Lenders wish to declare an Event of Default and/or exercise their
rights hereunder, the Agent will exercise the rights of the Lenders hereunder as
directed by the Required Lenders.

8.6    Indemnification.  To the extent the Borrower does not reimburse and
save harmless the Agent according to the terms hereof for and from all costs,
expenses and disbursements in connection herewith, such costs, expenses and
disbursements shall be borne by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their
respective Commitments. Each Lender hereby agrees on such basis (i) to reimburse
the Agent for such Lender's pro rata share of all such reasonable costs,
expenses and disbursements on request and (ii) to the extent of each such
Lender's pro rata share, to indemnify and save harmless the Agent against and
from any and all losses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments and suits
and other costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent, other than
as a consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Agent, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents or any other agreement, instrument or document in connection herewith
or therewith, or any request of the Required Lenders, including without
limitation the reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements in connection with
defending itself against any claim or liability related to the exercise or
performance of any of its powers or duties under this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, or any of the other agreements, instruments or documents delivered in
connection herewith or the taking of any action under or in connection with any
of the foregoing.
<PAGE>

8.7    Agent's Rights as a Lender.  With respect to the Commitments of the
Agent as a Lender hereunder and any Loans of the Agent under this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents and any other agreements, instruments and documents
delivered pursuant hereto, the Agent shall have the same rights, powers, duties
and obligations under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or other
agreements, instruments or documents as any Lender, and may exercise such rights
and powers and shall perform such duties and fulfill such obligations as though
it were not the Agent. The Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage, and continue to engage, in any kind of business with the
Borrower as if it were not the Agent.

8.8    Loan Advances by Agent.  Unless the officers of the Agent responsible
for administering this Agreement shall have been notified in writing by a Lender
prior to the date of any Revolving Credit Loan that such Lender will not make
the amount which would constitute its pro rata share of such Revolving Credit
Loan available to the Agent on or prior to the date of such Revolving Credit
Loan, the Agent may (but shall not be required to) assume that such Lender has
made such amount available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit
Loan and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. If such pro rata share is made available to the
Agent by a Lender on a date after the date of such Revolving Credit Loan, such
Lender shall pay to the Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i)
the average, computed for the period referred to in clause (iii) below, of the
weighted average interest rate for federal funds as determined by the Agent
during each day included in such period, times (ii) the amount of such Lender's
pro rata share of such Revolving Credit Loan, times (iii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed from and including the
date of such Revolving Credit Loan, to the date on which such pro rata share of
such Revolving Credit Loan became immediately available to the Agent, and the
denominator of which is 365. A statement of the Agent submitted to any Lender
with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 8.8 shall be prima facie
evidence as to the amount owed by that Lender to the Agent. If such Lender's pro
rata share is not in fact made available to the Agent by such Lender within
three (3) Business Days of the date of any Revolving Credit Loan, the Agent
shall be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per
annum then applicable under the Prime Rate Option during such period, on demand,
from such Lender.

8.9    Payment to Lenders. Promptly after receipt from the Borrower of any
principal repayment of the Revolving Credit Loans, interest due on the Revolving
Credit Loans, and any Fees or other amounts due under any of the Loan Documents,
the Agent shall distribute to each Lender that Lender's Commitment Percentage of
the funds so received. Such delivery shall be accomplished in such a manner as
to allow each Lender to receive its share of such payment in immediately
available funds on the same day that the funds representing payment due from the
Borrower are collected funds in the possession of the Agent.

8.10    Pro Rata Sharing.  Any sums obtained from the Borrower by any Lender
by reason of the exercise of its rights of setoff or banker's lien shall be
shared pro rata among the Lenders. Nothing in this Section 8.10 shall be deemed
to require the sharing among the
<PAGE>

Lenders of collections specifically relating to, or of the proceeds of
collateral which specifically secures any other Indebtedness of the Borrower to
any Lender.

8.11    Notice of Event of Default.  Each Lender shall use its best efforts to
notify the Agent immediately in writing of any Default or Event of Default of
which it becomes aware. Upon receipt of any such notice, the Agent shall use its
best efforts to notify the Lenders immediately in writing of such Default or
Event of Default. The Agent shall notify each Lender of any Default or Event of
Default as soon as practicable after obtaining knowledge thereof.

8.12    Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign as Agent upon ninety (90) days'
notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. If such notice shall be given, the
Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders,
during such ninety (90)-day period, which successor agent shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Borrower, to serve as agent hereunder and under the several
documents, the forms of which are attached hereto as exhibits, or which are
referred to herein. If at the end of such ninety (90)-day period the Lenders
have not appointed such a successor, the Agent shall procure a successor
reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders and the Borrower, to serve as agent for
the Lenders hereunder and under the several documents, the forms of which are
attached hereto as exhibits, or which are referred to herein. Any such successor
agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent. Upon the
appointment of such successor agent or upon the expiration of such ninety (90)-
day period (or any longer period to which the Agent has agreed), the former
Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any
other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the
parties to this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Article 8 shall inure to the benefit of such
retiring Agent as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent under this Agreement.


ARTICLE 9.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

hereby gives to each Lender and any Participant a lien and security interest

transactions pursuant to or in connection with any of the Loan Documents other
than for any tax which is measured on the Agent's or Lender's net income. The
Borrower agrees to save the Agent and the Lenders harmless from and against any
and all present and future claims or liabilities with respect to, or resulting
from, any delay in paying or failure to pay any such taxes or similar
impositions. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall

(which Participants may be Affiliates of a Lender) Participations in the

this Agreement, such Lender shall remain the holder of the Revolving Credit Note
made payable to it for all purposes under this Agreement, the Borrower shall

9.6b    Right of Setoff.  The Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under
this Agreement and the Notes are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or
shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Participant shall be deemed to have, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, the right of setoff in respect of its Participation in amounts owing under

Participation were owing directly to it as a lender under this Agreement or the
Notes.

9.6c    Withholding of Income Taxes.  At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account
of any Participant each Participant that is not incorporated under the laws of

and performance of each of the Loan Documents, the Loans, the Notes and any and
all transactions related to or consummated in connection with the Loans,
including, without limitation, losses, liabilities, damages, claims, costs and
expenses suffered or incurred by the Agent or any Lender or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents or Affiliates
arising out of or related to investigating, preparing for, defending against, or
providing evidence, producing documents or taking any other action in respect of
any commenced or threatened litigation, administrative proceeding or
investigation under any Federal securities law or any other Governmental Rule of
any jurisdiction, or at common law or otherwise, that is alleged to arise out of
or is based on (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party in any
document or schedule filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any
other Governmental Authority; (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state any
material fact required to be stated in such document or schedule, or necessary

other statute, regulation or other law of any jurisdiction applicable to the
making of any such acquisition, the purchase of shares or assets pursuant
thereto, the financing of such purchases or the consummation of the other

at common law or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 9.7 shall survive the
payment of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

such information, (ii) pursuant to what the Agent or such Lender believes to be

subpoena and (iv) to their respective attorneys, accountants and auditors.\\

ARTICLE II

THE CREDITS

2.1. Advances.  (a)  From and including the date hereof to but excluding
the Facility Termination Date, each Lender severally (and not jointly) agrees,
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Loans to the
Borrower from time to time in amounts not to exceed in the aggregate at any one
time outstanding the amount of its pro-rata share of the Aggregate Commitment
existing at such time.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Borrower
may borrow, repay and reborrow Advances at any time prior to the Facility
Termination Date.

(b) The Borrower hereby agrees that if at any time, as a result of
reductions in the Aggregate Commitment pursuant to Section 2.4 or otherwise,
the aggregate balance of the Loans exceeds the Aggregate Commitment, the
Borrower shall repay immediately its then outstanding Loans in such amount as
may be necessary to eliminate such excess.

(c) The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on,
the Loans shall be evidenced by the Notes.  Although the Notes shall be dated
the date of the initial Advance, interest in respect thereof shall be payable
only for the periods during which the Loans evidenced thereby are outstanding
and, although the stated amount of each Note shall be equal to the applicable
Lender's Commitment, each Note shall be enforceable, with respect to the
Borrower's obligation to pay the principal amount thereof, only to the extent
of the unpaid principal amount of the Loan at the time evidenced thereby.

(d) All Advances and all Loans shall mature, and the principal amount
thereof and the unpaid accrued interest thereon shall be due and payable, on
the Facility Termination Date.

2.2. Ratable Loans.  Each Advance hereunder shall consist of Loans made
from the several Lenders ratably in proportion to the ratio that their
respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment.

2.3. Types of Advances.  The Advances may be Alternate Base Rate Advances,
Federal Funds Rate Advances or Eurodollar Advances, or a combination thereof,
selected by the Borrower in accordance with Sections 2.7 and 2.8.


13
<PAGE>   20


2.4. Facility Fee; Reductions in Aggregate Commitment.  (a)  The Borrower
agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee ("the
"Facility Fee") in an amount equal to the Facility Fee Percentage times the
daily average Commitment of such Lender (regardless of usage) from the date
hereof to and including the Facility Termination Date, payable quarterly in
arrears on the first Business Day following the end of each calendar quarter
hereafter and on the Facility Termination Date.  All accrued Facility Fees
shall be payable on the effective date of any termination of the obligations of
the Lenders to make Loans hereunder.

(b) The Borrower may permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole,
or in part ratably among the Lenders in a minimum aggregate amount of
$5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, upon at
least three (3) Business Days' written notice to the Agent, which notice shall
specify the amount of any such reduction; provided, however, that the amount of
the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Advances.

2.5. Minimum Amount of Each Advance.  Each Eurodollar Advance shall be in
the minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess
thereof), and each Floating Rate Advance shall be in the minimum amount of
$5,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess thereof); provided,
however, that (a) any Floating Rate Advance may be in the amount of the unused
Aggregate Commitment and (b) in no event shall more than five (5) Eurodollar
Advances be permitted to be outstanding at any time.

2.6. Optional Principal Payments.  The Borrower may from time to time pay,
without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in a
minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000
in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances upon
two Business Days' prior notice to the Agent.  Subject to Section 3.4 and upon
like notice, a Eurodollar Advance may be paid prior to the last day of the
applicable Interest Period in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or any integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

2.7. Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances.  The
Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each Eurodollar
Advance, the Interest Period applicable to each Advance from time to time.  The
Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing Notice") not
later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Borrowing Date of each Floating
Rate Advance and at least three (3) Business Days before the Borrowing Date for
each Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

(a)  the Borrowing Date of such Advance, which shall be a Business Day;

(b)  the aggregate amount of such Advance;

(c)  the Type of Advance selected; and

(d) in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period
applicable thereto, which shall end on or prior to the Facility Termination
Date;


14
<PAGE>   21

provided, however, that with respect to the initial Advance, the Borrowing
Notice shall be delivered to the Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time)
one Business Day before the date of the initial Advance and shall be for a
Floating Rate Advance.  Not later than noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing
Date, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans, in funds immediately
available in Chicago, to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article
XIII.  The Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to
the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.

2.8. Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating Rate
Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such
Floating Rate Advances are repaid or are converted into Eurodollar Advances.
Each Eurodollar Advance shall continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of
the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar
Advance shall be automatically converted into an Alternate Base Rate Advance
unless the Borrower shall have given the Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice
requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Advance
continue as a Eurodollar Advance for the same or another Interest Period.
Subject to the terms of Section 2.5, the Borrower may elect from time to time
to convert all or any part of an Advance of any Type into any other Type or
Types of Advances; provided, however, that any conversion of any Eurodollar
Advance shall be made on, and only on, the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto.  The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a
"Conversion/Continuation Notice") of each conversion of a Floating Rate Advance
or continuation of a Eurodollar Advance not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago
time) on such Business Day in the case of a conversion into a Floating Rate
Advance, or at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the requested
conversion or continuation in the case of a conversion into or continuation of
a Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

(a) the requested date of such conversion or continuation, which shall
be a Business Day;

(b) the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be
converted or continued; and

(c) the amount and Type(s) of Advance(s) into which such Advance is to
be converted or continued and, in the case of a conversion into or continuation
of a Eurodollar Advance, the duration of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, which shall end on or prior to the Facility Termination Date.

2.9. Changes in Interest Rate, etc.  Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear
interest at the Floating Rate from and including the date of such Advance or
the date on which such Advance was converted into a Floating Rate Advance to
(but not including) the date on which such Floating Rate Advance is paid or
converted to a Eurodollar Advance.  Changes in the rate of interest on that
portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect
simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate or the Federal Funds
Rate, as the case may be.  Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest from and
including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to, but not
including, the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined
as applicable to such Eurodollar Advance.  No Interest Period may end after the
Facility Termination Date.


15
<PAGE>   22

2.10. Rates Applicable After Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 2.7 or 2.8, no Advance may be made as, converted
into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance (except with the consent of the Agent
and the Required Lenders) when any Default or Unmatured Default has occurred
and is continuing.  During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders
may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at
the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates),
declare that each Eurodollar Advance and Floating Rate Advance shall bear
interest (for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period in the case of
Eurodollar Advances) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate  plus
two percent (2%) per annum; provided, however, that such increased rate shall
automatically and without action of any kind by the Lenders become and remain
applicable until revoked by the Required Lenders in the event of a Default
described in Section 7.6 or 7.7.

2.11. Method of Payment.  All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall
be made, without setoff, deduction or counterclaim, in immediately available
funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to Article XIII,
or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the
Agent to the Borrower, by noon (Chicago time) on the date when due and shall be
applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders.  Each payment delivered to the
Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to
such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at its address
specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in
a notice received by the Agent from such Lender.  The Agent is hereby
authorized to charge the account of the Borrower maintained with First Chicago
for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.

2.12. Notes; Telephonic Notices.  Each Lender is hereby authorized to
record the principal amount of each of its Loans and each repayment on its
books and records in accordance with its usual practices; provided, however,
that neither the failure to so record nor any error in such recordation shall
affect the Borrower's obligations under such Note.  The Borrower hereby
authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances,
effect selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on
telephonic notices made by any Authorized Officer or any person or persons
designated by an Authorized Officer in writing to the Agent which the Agent or
any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower.  The
Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, if
such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic
notice signed by an Authorized Officer.  If the written confirmation differs in
any material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the
records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.

2.13. Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  Interest accrued on
each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on the first day of each month,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date
on which a Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or
otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall
be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on
which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise,
and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an
Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day
of each three-month interval during such Interest Period.  Interest on
Eurodollar Advances


16
<PAGE>   23

and Facility Fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of
a 360-day year.  Interest on Floating Rate Advances shall be calculated for
actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as the case may be.
Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of
any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (Chicago
time) at the place of payment.  If any payment of principal of or interest on
an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a
principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest in connection with such payment.

2.14. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment
Reductions.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender
of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing
Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it
hereunder.  The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable
to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate
and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base
Rate or the Federal Funds Rate.

2.15. Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and the Notes shall be deemed held by each Lender for
the benefit of such Lending Installation.  Each Lender may, by written or telex
notice to the Agent and the Borrower, designate a Lending Installation through
which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be
made.

2.16. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent.  Unless the Borrower or a Lender,
as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan, or (b) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made.  The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.
If the Borrower has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the Lenders
shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available
together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the
date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
Funds Effective Rate for such day.  If any Lender has not in fact made such
payment to the Agent, such Lender or the Borrower shall, on demand by the
Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers
such amount at a rate per annum equal to (a) in the case of payment by a
Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day, or (b) in the case of
payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

2.17. Taxes.  (a) Any payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement
shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on
account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any


17
<PAGE>   24

Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes or any
other tax based upon net income imposed on the Agent or any Lender by the
jurisdiction in which the Agent or such Lender is incorporated or has its
principal place of business. If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are
required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Agent or any Lender
hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Agent or such Lender shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Agent or such Lender (after
payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable
hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in or pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to
increase any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the
laws of the U.S. or a state thereof if such Lender fails to comply with the
requirements of paragraph (b) of this Section 2.17.  Whenever any Non-Excluded
Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as practicable thereafter the
Borrower shall send to the Agent for its own account or for the account of such
Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt
received by the Borrower showing payment thereof.  If the Borrower fails to pay
any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to
remit to the Agent the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for any
incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any Agent
or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section
2.17 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all
other amounts payable hereunder.

(b) At least five Business Days prior to the first date on which
interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Lender, each
Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America,
or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the
Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form
1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of
any United States federal income taxes.  Each Lender which so delivers a Form
1001 or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the
Agent two additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the
date that such form expires (currently, three successive calendar years for
Form 1001 and one calendar year for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so
delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof
as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case
certifying that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States
federal income taxes, unless an event (including, without limitation, any
change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which
any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and
delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender advises the
Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any
deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

2.18. Agent's Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent those fees, in
addition to the Facility Fees referenced in Section 2.4(a), in the amounts and
at the times separately agreed to between the Agent and the Borrower.

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

3.1. Yield Protection.  If, after the date hereof, the adoption of or any
change in any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
interpretation thereof, or the compliance of any Lender therewith,

(a) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any
tax, duty, charge or withholding on or from payments due from the Borrower
(excluding taxation of the overall net income of any Lender or applicable
Lending Installation imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender or
Lending Installation is incorporated or has its principal place of business),
or changes the basis of taxation of principal, interest or any other payments
to any Lender or Lending Installation in respect of its Loans or other amounts
due it hereunder, or

(b) imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment,
insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any
applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into
account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

(c) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the
cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or
maintaining Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any
applicable Lending Installation in connection with any Loans, or requires any
Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by
reference to the amount of Loans held, or interest received by it, by an amount
deemed material by such Lender,

then, within 30 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such
Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or resulting in an
amount received which such Lender determines is attributable to making, funding
and maintaining its Loans and its Commitment; provided that the Borrower shall
not be required to pay any such expense or reimburse for reduced amounts
received more than 180 days prior to the date of demand.

3.2. Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations.  If a Lender determines the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 30 days of demand by such
Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate
for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased
capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its
Loans or its obligation to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such
Lender's policies as to capital adequacy); provided that the Borrower shall not
be required to pay such amount with respect to any shortfall incurred more than
180 days prior to the date of demand.  "Change" means (a) any change after the
date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines, or (b) any
adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental
rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive


19
<PAGE>   26

(whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this Agreement which
affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any
Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender.
"Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (a) the risk-based capital guidelines in
effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement and (b) the
corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside
the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on
Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices entitled "International
Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards" and any amendments
to such regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

3.3. Availability of Types of Advances.  If (a) any Lender determines that
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or (b) the Required Lenders determine that deposits of
a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are  not
available or the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining such Eurodollar Advances,
then (x) in the case of clause (a) above, the Agent shall suspend the
availability of Eurodollar Advances from such Lender and require any (1)
outstanding Eurodollar Loans from affected Lender to be promptly converted into
Alternate Base Rate Loans and (2) future Eurodollar Loans from such Lender to
be funded as Alternate Base Rate Loans for the future Interest Periods until
the conditions described in clause (a) cease to exist, and (y) in the case of
clause (b) above, the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar
Advances until such unavailability or cost problem ceases to exist and require
that the Eurodollar Advances affected be converted to Alternate Base Rate
Advances on the last day of the applicable Interest Period.

3.4. Funding Indemnification.  If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar
Advance is not made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other
than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify the Agent and each
Lender for any loss or cost (but not lost profits) incurred by it resulting
therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or
employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain the Eurodollar Advance.

3.5. Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender
under Sections 2.17, 3.1 and 3.2 or to avoid the unavailability of a Type of
Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous
to such Lender.  Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender
to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under
Section 2.17, 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4.  Such written statement shall set forth in
reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such
amount and shall be presumptively correct and binding on the Borrower in the
absence of manifest error.  Determination of amounts payable under such
Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though
each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the
type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in
determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that
is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in
the written statement of any Lender shall


20
<PAGE>   27

be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of the written statement.
The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

<PAGE>   29

The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

5.1. Corporate Existence; Conduct of Business.  Each of the Borrower and
each Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation,
(b) is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where failure to be so qualified
will not have a Material Adverse Effect, and (c) possesses all licenses,
registrations and authorizations from and with any Governmental Authority,
self-regulatory organization or securities exchange necessary or material to
the conduct of its business as presently conducted.  Nuveen & Co. is (a) a
broker-dealer duly registered under the Exchange Act, (b) a member in good
standing of the NASD, (c) not in arrears in regard to any assessment of the
SIPC, and (d) has received no notice from the SEC, MSRB, NASD or any other

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.2. Authorization and Validity.  The Borrower has all requisite power and
authority (corporate and otherwise) to execute and deliver each of the Loan
Documents  and to perform its obligations thereunder.  The execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents and the performance of its
obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate
proceedings and the Loan Documents constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with
their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by
general principles of equity limiting the availability of equitable remedies.

5.3. Compliance with Laws and Contracts.  The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with all applicable laws,
statutes, and rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of any Governmental
Authority, self-regulatory organization or securities exchange having
jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership
of their respective properties (including, without limitation, the Exchange
Act, the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, NASD, NYSE, MSRB and CFTC), except where the failure to
so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, the
application of the proceeds of the Loans, the consummation of any transaction
contemplated by the Loan Documents, nor compliance with the provisions of the
Loan Documents  will, or at the relevant time did, (a) violate any law, rule,
regulation (including Regulations G, T, U and X), order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the
Borrower's or any Subsidiary's charter, articles or certificate of
incorporation or by-laws, (b) violate the provisions of or require the approval
or consent of any party to any indenture, instrument or agreement to which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its
property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Liens permitted by
Section 6.17) in, of or on the property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary
pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement, or (c)
require the consent or approval of any Person, except for any violation of, or
failure to obtain



23
<PAGE>   30

an approval or consent required under, any such indenture, instrument or
agreement that could not have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.4. Governmental Consents.  No order, consent, approval, qualification,
license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of, any Governmental
Authority, self-regulatory organization or securities exchange is necessary or
required in connection with the execution, delivery, consummation or
performance of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of,
any of the Loan Documents, the application of the proceeds of the Loans, or the
consummation of any other transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents.
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under or in violation of
any foreign, federal, state or local law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree or award binding upon or applicable to the
Borrower or such Subsidiary, in each case the consequence of which default or
violation could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.5. Financial Statements.  The Borrower has heretofore furnished to each
of the Lenders (a) the December 31, 1996 audited consolidated financial
statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (b) the March 31, 1997
unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, and (c) the December 31, 1996 audited financial statements for
each of Nuveen & Co., Nuveen Advisory and Nuveen Institutional (collectively,
the "Financial Statements").  The Borrower has also heretofore furnished to
each of the Lenders the December 31, 1996, March 31, 1997 and June 30, 1997
quarterly Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single (FOCUS) Reports of
Nuveen & Co. (the "FOCUS Reports").  Each of the Financial Statements was
prepared in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles and fairly presents
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (or of
the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be) at such dates and for the
respective periods then ended (except, in the case of such unaudited
statements, for normal year-end audit adjustments).  The FOCUS Reports are
correct and complete in all material respects and conform in all material
respects to Exchange Act requirements and applicable SEC rules and regulations.

5.6. Material Adverse Change.  No material adverse change in the business,
Property, condition (financial or otherwise), performance, or results of
operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole has occurred
since December 31, 1996.

5.7. Taxes.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed or caused to be
filed on a timely basis and in correct form all United States federal and
applicable state tax returns and all other material tax returns which are
required to be filed and have paid all material taxes due pursuant to said
returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and
as to which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with Agreement
Accounting Principles.  As of the date hereof, the United States income tax
returns of the Borrower on a consolidated basis have been audited by the
Internal Revenue Service through its Fiscal Year ending December 31, 1990 and,
to the Borrower's knowledge, there are no pending audits or investigations
regarding the Borrower's or its Subsidiaries' federal, state or local tax
returns which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse



24
<PAGE>   31

Effect. No tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with
respect to any such taxes which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.  The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental
charges are in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles.

5.8. Litigation and Contingent Obligations.  There is no litigation,
arbitration, proceeding,  inquiry or investigation by any Governmental
Authority, self-regulatory organization or securities exchange pending or, to
the knowledge of any of the Borrower's officers, threatened against or
affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective Properties
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent, enjoin or unduly delay the making of the Loans or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary has any material contingent obligations not provided for or
disclosed in the Financial Statements.

5.9. Subsidiaries.  Schedule 5.9 hereto contains an accurate list of all
of the Borrower's existing Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement,
setting forth their respective jurisdictions of incorporation and the
percentage of their capital stock owned by the Borrower or other Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.9 and except for Seed Money, as of the date
hereof, the Borrower does not own or hold, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock or equity security of, or any equity or partnership interest in, any
Person other than such Subsidiaries.

5.10. ERISA.  Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.10, neither the Borrower
nor any other member of the Controlled Group maintains any Single Employer
Plans, and no Single Employer Plan has any Unfunded Liability.  Neither the
Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled Group maintains, or is
obligated to contribute to, any Multiemployer Plan or has incurred, or is
reasonably expected to incur, any withdrawal liability to any Multiemployer
Plan.  Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and regulations.  Neither the Borrower nor any member of
the Controlled Group has, with respect to any Plan, failed to make any
contribution or pay any amount required under Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA or the terms of such Plan which could reasonably be
expected to be in excess of $5,000,000.  There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened claims, actions, investigations or
lawsuits against any Plan, any fiduciary thereof, or the Borrower or any member
of the Controlled Group with respect to a Plan which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Borrower nor any
member of the Controlled Group has engaged in any prohibited transaction (as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) in connection with
any Plan which would subject such Person to any material liability.  Within the
last five years neither the Borrower nor any member of the Controlled Group has
engaged in a transaction which resulted in a Single Employer Plan with an
Unfunded Liability being transferred out of the Controlled Group.  No
Termination Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur with respect
to any Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

5.11. Defaults.  No Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is
continuing.
5.12. Federal Reserve Regulations.  Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is engaged, directly or indirectly, principally, or as one of its
important activities, in the business of extending, or arranging for the
extension of, credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.
No


25

<PAGE>   32

part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used in a manner which would violate,
or result in a violation of, Regulation G, Regulation T, Regulation U or
Regulation X.  Neither the making of any Advance hereunder or the use of the
proceeds thereof will violate or be inconsistent with the provisions of
Regulation G, Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X.  Following the
application of the proceeds of the Loans, less than 25% of the value (as
determined by any reasonable method) of the assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other
restriction hereunder taken as a whole have been, and will continue to be,
represented by Margin Stock.

5.13. Investment Company; Public Utility Holding Company.  Neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary is, or after giving effect to any Advance will be,
an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  Neither
the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

5.14. Certain Fees.  No broker's or finder's fee or commission was, is or
will be payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify the Agent and the Lenders against and agrees that it will hold each
of them harmless from any claim, demand or liability for any broker's or
finder's fees or commissions alleged to have been incurred by the Borrower in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and time charges of
attorneys for the Agent or any Lender, which attorneys may be employees of the
Agent or any Lender) arising in connection with any such claim, demand or
liability.  No other similar fee or commissions will be payable by the Borrower
or any Subsidiary for any other services rendered to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary ancillary to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.15. Ownership of Properties.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have a
subsisting leasehold interest in, or good and marketable title, free of all
Liens, other than those permitted by Section 6.17, to all of the properties and
assets reflected in the Financial Statements as being owned by it, except for
assets sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of
business since the date thereof and such defects of title and Liens as could
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  To the
knowledge of the Borrower, there are no actual, threatened or alleged defaults
with respect to any leases of real property under which the Borrower or any
Subsidiary is lessee or lessor which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

5.16. Material Agreements.  Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or which restricts or imposes conditions upon the ability of any
Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends or make other distributions on its capital
stock, (b) make loans or advances to the Borrower, (c) repay loans or advances
from the Borrower or (d) grant Liens to the Agent to secure the Obligations.
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the performance,
observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or



26
<PAGE>   33

conditions contained in any agreement to which it is a party, which default
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.17. Insurance.  The Borrower and its Subsidiaries maintain with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance on their Property
in such amounts and covering such risks as is consistent with sound business
practice.

5.18. Disclosure.  None of the (a) information, exhibits or reports
furnished or to be furnished by the Borrower or any Subsidiary to the Agent or
to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of the Loan Documents, taken
as a whole, or (b) representations or warranties of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary contained in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any other
document, certificate or written statement furnished to the Agent or the
Lenders by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to this
Agreement contained, contains or will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted, omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances in which they were made.  There is no fact known to
the Borrower (other than matters of a general economic nature) that has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and that has not
been disclosed herein or in such other documents, certificates and statements
furnished to the Lenders for use in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

8.1. Acceleration.  If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs
with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Agent
or any Lender.  If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or the Agent
with the consent of the Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the
obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder, or declare the Obligations
to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall become
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

If, within ten Business Days after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or
entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the
Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration
and/or termination.

8.2. Amendments.  Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving
any Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement
shall, without the consent of each Lender:

(a  Extend the final maturity of any Loan or Note or reduce the principal
amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or
fees thereon;

(b  Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders;

(c  Increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder;

(d  Extend the Facility Termination Date ;

(e  Amend this Section 8.2;

hereunder; or

(g  Waive or amend the right to approve a successor to The St. Paul
Companies, Inc. for purposes of clause (b) of the definition of "Change in
Control".

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall be
effective without the written consent of the Agent.  The Agent may waive
payment of the fee required under Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent
of any other party to this Agreement.

8.3. Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of
the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then
only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All remedies
contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all
shall be available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been
paid in full.


ARTICLE IX

<PAGE>   44

understanding among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and supersede all

Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof other than the fee letter dated
June 26, 1997 in favor of First Chicago.

9.6. Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.  The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Agent is authorized to act as such).  The failure of any Lender to perform any
of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer
any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement
and their respective successors and assigns.

9.7. Expenses; Indemnification.  The Borrower shall reimburse the Agent
and the Arranger for any reasonable costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket

or the Arranger) paid or incurred by the Agent or the Arranger in connection
with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, review, syndication,
amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents.  The
Borrower also agrees to reimburse the Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders for
any reasonable costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, the
Arranger and the Lenders, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent, the
Arranger or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Agent, the Arranger or any
Lender in connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents.
The Borrower further agrees to indemnify the Agent, the Arranger and each
Lender, its directors, officers and employees against all losses, claims,
damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not
the Agent, the Arranger or any Lender is a party thereto) which any of them may
pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the direct or
indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any Loan
hereunder, except to the extent that they arise out of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification.  The obligations of
the Borrower under this Section shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

9.8. Numbers of Documents.  All statements, notices, closing documents,
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient
counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders.

9.9. Accounting.  Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to
this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.


38


<PAGE>   45

9.11. Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship between the Borrower and
the Lenders and the Agent shall be solely that of borrower and lender.  Neither
the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the
Borrower.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to
the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with
any phase of the Borrower's business or operations.  The Borrower shall rely
entirely upon its own judgment with respect to its business, and any review,
inspection or supervision of, or information supplied to the Borrower by the
Agent or the Lenders is for the protection of the Agent and the Lenders and
neither the Borrower nor any other Person is entitled to rely thereon.

9.12. CHOICE OF LAW.  THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS, OF THE STATE
OF ILLINOIS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

9.13. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.  EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO
THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR ILLINOIS STATE
COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING

IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH
COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO
THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR
THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT
OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE
COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.  ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER
AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER
INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF,
RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A
COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS; PROVIDED, THAT SUCH PROCEEDINGS MAY BE BROUGHT IN
OTHER COURTS IF JURISDICTION MAY NOT BE OBTAINED IN A COURT IN CHICAGO,
ILLINOIS.

9.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY

RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

9.15. Disclosure.  Each Lender hereby (a) acknowledges and agrees that

rate hedging instruments or agreements or swap transactions, and (b) waives any
liability of First Chicago or such Affiliate to such Lender arising out of or
resulting from such investments, loans or relationships which would not exist
but for First Chicago's status as Agent hereunder.

9.16. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and
any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such
counterpart.  This Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by
the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Agent
that it has taken such action.


ARTICLE X

THE AGENT

10.1. Appointment.  First Chicago is hereby appointed Agent hereunder and
under each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders authorizes the Agent to
act as the agent of such Lender.  The Agent agrees to act as such upon the
express conditions contained in this Article X.  The Agent shall not have a
fiduciary relationship in respect of the Borrower or any Lender by reason of
this Agreement, any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or
thereby.

10.2. Powers.  The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the
Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each
thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The
Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder, except any action specifically provided
by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

10.3. General Immunity.  Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower or any Lender for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except for its or
their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

10.4. No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc.  Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty
or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder, (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender, (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except
receipt of items required to be delivered to the Agent and not waived at
closing, or (d) the validity, effectiveness, sufficiency, enforceability or
genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished
in connection therewith.  The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the
Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to the
Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the Agent
(either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).


40



<PAGE>   47

10.5. Action on Instructions of Lenders.  The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under
any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders (or, to the extent required by Section 8.2, all Lenders), and
such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding on all of the Lenders and on all holders of Notes.  The Agent shall
be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and
under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and
expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

10.6. Employment of Agents and Counsel.  The Agent may execute any of its
duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.  The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its
duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

10.7. Reliance on Documents; Counsel.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

10.8. Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to
their Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (a) for any amounts
not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement
by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (b) for any other expenses incurred
by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents, and
(c) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent
in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other
document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated
thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other
documents; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to
the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Agent.  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

10.9. Notice of Default.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder
unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default".  In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
Lenders.


41



<PAGE>   48

10.10. Rights as a Lender.  In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is
a Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its
individual capacity.  The Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such
Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

10.11. Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

10.12. Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of
its intention to resign.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Lenders, a successor Agent.  If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the resigning Agent's
giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint,
on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent.  The appointment
of any successor Agent shall be subject to the prior approval of the Borrower,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  If the Agent has resigned
and no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the
duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in
respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes
shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor Agent shall be deemed to be
appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has accepted the appointment.
Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained
earnings of at least $50,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the resigning Agent.  Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the
Agent, the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the Loan Documents.  After the effectiveness of the
resignation of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.

10.13. Co-Agents.  There shall be no rights, obligations or liabilities
afforded to or imposed upon the Co-Agents by virtue of their status as such.

ARTICLE XI

SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

11.1. Setoff.  In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender
to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied
toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the
Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due.

11.2. Ratable Payments.  If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater proportion than its pro-rata share of
such Loans, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of
the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender
will hold its ratable proportion of Loans.  If any Lender, whether in
connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or
otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such
amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans.  In case any
such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.  If an amount to be setoff is to be applied to
Indebtedness of the Borrower to a Lender, other than Indebtedness evidenced by
any of the Notes held by such Lender, such amount shall be applied ratably to
such other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness evidenced by such Notes.


ARTICLE XII

BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

12.1. Successors and Assigns.  The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and
the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (a) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents, and (b) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3.  Notwithstanding clause (b) of this Section, any Lender may
at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the Agent, assign all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Notes to a Federal
Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment to a Federal Reserve
Bank shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.  The
Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes
hereof unless and until such payee complies with Section 12.3 in the case of an
assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of
the transfer is filed with the Agent.  Any assignee or transferee of a Note
agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the
Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the
time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder
of any Note, shall be conclusive and binding on any


43


<PAGE>   50

subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note
or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

12.2. Participations.

12.2.1.  Permitted Participants; Effect.  Any Lender may, in the ordinary
course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell
to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests
in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment
of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.
In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a
Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain
unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the
holder of any such Note for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts
payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such
Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the
Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.
Participants shall be entitled to the benefits of the cost protection
provisions contained in Sections 2.17, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 9.7 to the same extent
as if they were Lenders, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
reimburse Participants pursuant to such provisions in an amount in excess of
the amount that would have been payable thereunder to such Lender had such
Lender not sold such participation.

12.2.2.  Voting Rights.  Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
modification or waiver which effects any of the modifications referenced in
clauses (a) through (f) of Section 8.2.

12.2.3.  Benefit of Setoff.  The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect
of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the
same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly
to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents; provided, that each Lender shall
retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount
of participating interests sold to each Participant.  The Lenders agree to
share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of
setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount
received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be
shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.


44


<PAGE>   51

12.3. Assignments.

12.3.1.  Permitted Assignments.  Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of
its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one
or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights
and obligations under the Loan Documents; provided, however, that in the case
of an assignment to an entity which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a
Lender, such assignment shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000.  Such
assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto or in such
other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto.  The consent of the
Agent and, so long as no Default is continuing, the Borrower shall be required
prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is
not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof.  Such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

12.3.2.  Effect; Effective Date.  Upon (a) delivery to the Agent of a
notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit I to
Exhibit C hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents
required by Section 12.3.1, and (b) payment by the transferor Lender or
Purchaser of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment, such
assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such
Notice of Assignment.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, (a)
such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and
any other Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all the rights
and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if
it were an original party hereto, and (b) the transferor Lender shall be
released with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans
assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the
Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent.  Upon the consummation of any assignment to
a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent
and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that replacement Notes
are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate,
replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal
amounts reflecting their Commitment, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

12.4  Confidentiality.  (a)  Each Lender agrees with the Borrower that all
information concerning the Borrower and its Subsidiaries that is furnished or
has previously been furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower
(herein collectively referred to as the "Confidential Information") in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, will be held and
treated by such Lender in confidence and will not, except as hereinafter
provided, without the prior consent of the Borrower, be disclosed by such
Lender, in whole or in part, or be used by such Lender other than in connection
with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  Each Lender further agrees to
disclose Confidential Information only to its Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents or representatives
(collectively, "Related Persons") who need to know the Confidential Information
for purposes of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents and who agree to
keep such information confidential and to be bound by the terms of the
agreement contained in this Section 12.4 to the same extent as if they were
Lenders.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not constitute
"Confidential Information" for purposes of the agreement contained in this
Section 12.4:

(i) information which was or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by any Lender or Related Persons; and


45



<PAGE>   52


(ii) information which was or becomes available
on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than
the Borrower who, insofar as is known to any Lender,
is not prohibited from transmitting the information by
a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the
Borrower.

(c) Further, each Lender may disclose Confidential Information:

(i) to any Governmental Authority (or any
self-regulatory organization) to which such Lender is
or becomes subject, or in connection with an
examination of such Lender by such Governmental
Authority (or self-regulatory organization);

(ii) pursuant to subpoena or other legal process;

(iii) to any Person and in any proceeding
necessary in such Lender's reasonable judgment to
protect the interest of such Lender in connection with
any claim or dispute involving such Lender; and

(iv) to any Participant or Purchaser or any other
Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by
operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee if such Transferee has executed
an Assignment Agreement or a participation agreement
or other agreement containing a confidentiality
agreement substantially in the form of the agreement
contained in this Section 12.4.

12.5. Tax Treatment.  If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred
to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause
such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to
comply with the provisions of Section 2.17.

REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE


$_______________                                          Dated:  ________, 1997


FOR VALUE RECEIVED, THE JOHN NUVEEN COMPANY  (the "Borrower") HEREBY
PROMISES TO PAY to the order of__________________________________________
(the "Lender") the principal sum of_____________________ United States
Dollars ($__________) or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the
Loans made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1 of the Credit
Agreement (as hereinafter defined), on or before the Facility Termination Date;
together, in each case, with interest on any and all principal amounts
remaining unpaid hereunder from time to time.  Interest upon the unpaid
principal amount hereof shall accrue at the rates, shall be calculated in the
manner and shall be payable on the dates set forth in the Credit Agreement.
After maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, accrued interest shall be
payable upon demand.  Both principal and interest shall be payable in
accordance with the Credit Agreement to The First National Bank of Chicago, as
Agent (the "Agent") on behalf of the Lender, at its main office in Chicago,
Illinois in immediately available funds.  The Loans made by the Lender to the
Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement and all payments on account of
principal hereof shall be recorded by the Lender on its books and records in
accordance with its usual practices; provided, however, that the failure to so
record shall not affect the Borrower's obligations under this Revolving Credit
Note.

This Revolving Credit Note is a Note referred to in, and is entitled to
the benefits of, the Credit Agreement dated as of August 8, 1997 by and among
the Borrower, the financial institutions signatory thereto (including the
Lender) and the Agent (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time,
the "Credit Agreement") and the other Loan Documents.  Capitalized terms used
but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed
thereto in the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement, among other things,
contains provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening
of certain stated events and also for prepayments on account of principal
hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions therein
specified.

The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or notice of any
kind in connection with this Revolving Credit Note.

COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE


I,__________________ certify that I am the____________________ of  THE JOHN
NUVEEN COMPANY  (the "Borrower"), and that as such I am authorized to execute
this Compliance Certificate on behalf of the Borrower, and DO HEREBY FURTHER
CERTIFY on behalf of the Borrower that:

1.   I have reviewed the terms of that certain Credit Agreement dated as of
August 8, 1997 among the Borrower, the financial institutions named therein
(the "Lenders") and The First National Bank of Chicago, as agent (the "Agent")
(as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the "Credit
Agreement") and I have made, or have caused to be made by employees or agents
under my supervision, a detailed review of the transactions and conditions of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (as this and other capitalized terms not

FORM OF
ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT


This Assignment Agreement (this "Assignment Agreement") between
_______________________________ (the "Assignor") and _________ (the "Assignee")
is dated as of ___________________, 19__.  The parties hereto agree as follows:

2.1. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.  The Assignor is a party to a Credit Agreement
(which, as it may be amended, supplemented, modified, renewed or extended from
time to time is herein called the "Credit Agreement") described in Item 1 of
Schedule 1 attached hereto.  Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement.

2.2. ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION.  The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to
the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the Assignor,
an interest in and to the Assignor's rights and obligations under the Credit
Agreement such that after giving effect to such assignment the Assignee shall
have purchased pursuant to this Assignment Agreement the percentage interest
specified in Item 3 of Schedule 1 of all outstanding rights and obligations
under the Credit Agreement relating to the Loans and the other Loan Documents.
The aggregate Commitment (or Loans, if the applicable Commitment has been
terminated) purchased by the Assignee hereunder is set forth in Item 4 of
Schedule 1.

2.3. EFFECTIVE DATE.  The effective date of this Assignment Agreement (the
"Effective Date") shall be the later of the date specified in Item 5 of
Schedule 1 or two Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by the Agent)
after a Notice of Assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit I attached
hereto has been delivered to the Agent.  Such Notice of Assignment must include
any consents required to be delivered to the Agent pursuant to Section 12.3.1
of the Credit Agreement.  In no event will the Effective Date occur if the
payments required to be made by the Assignee to the Assignor on the Effective
Date under Section 4 hereof are not made on the proposed Effective Date.  The
Assignor will notify the Assignee of the proposed Effective Date no later than
the Business Day prior to the proposed Effective Date.  As of the Effective
Date, (a) the Assignee shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
the Loan Documents with respect to the rights and obligations assigned to the
Assignee hereunder, and (b) the Assignor shall relinquish its rights and be
released from its corresponding obligations under the Loan Documents with
respect to the rights and obligations assigned to the Assignee hereunder.

<PAGE>   64


2.4. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.  On and after the Effective Date, the Assignee
shall be entitled to receive from the Agent all payments of principal, interest
and fees with respect to the interest assigned hereby.  The Assignee shall
advance funds directly to the Agent with respect to all Loans and reimbursement
payments made on or after the Effective Date with respect to the interest
assigned hereby.  [In consideration for the sale and assignment of Loans
hereunder, (a) the Assignee shall pay the Assignor, on the Effective Date, an
amount equal to the principal amount of the portion of all Floating Rate Loans
assigned to the Assignee hereunder, and (b) with respect to each Eurodollar
Loan made by the Assignor and assigned to the Assignee hereunder which is
outstanding on the Effective Date, (i) on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor, (ii) on such earlier date agreed to by the Assignor and the Assignee,
or (iii) on the date on which any such Eurodollar Loan either becomes due (by
acceleration or otherwise) or is prepaid (the date as described in the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) being hereinafter referred to as the
"Payment Date"), the Assignee shall pay the Assignor an amount equal to the
principal amount of the portion of such Eurodollar Loan assigned to the
Assignee which is outstanding on the Payment Date.  If the Assignor and the
Assignee agree that the Payment Date for such Eurodollar Loan shall be the
Effective Date, they shall agree to the interest rate applicable to the portion
of such Loan assigned hereunder for the period from the Effective Date to the
end of the existing Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan (the
"Agreed Interest Rate") and any interest received by the Assignee in excess of
the Agreed Interest Rate shall be remitted to the Assignor.  In the event
interest for the period from the Effective Date to but not including the
Payment Date is not paid by the Borrower with respect to any Eurodollar Loan
sold by the Assignor to the Assignee hereunder, the Assignee shall pay to the
Assignor interest for such period on the portion of such Eurodollar Loan sold
by the Assignor to the Assignee hereunder at the applicable rate provided by
the Credit Agreement.  In the event a prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan which
is existing on the Payment Date and assigned by the Assignor to the Assignee
hereunder occurs after the Payment Date but before the end of the Interest
Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, the Assignee shall remit to the
Assignor the excess of the prepayment penalty paid with respect to the portion
of such Eurodollar Loan assigned to the Assignee hereunder over the amount
which would have been paid if such prepayment penalty was calculated based on
the Agreed Interest Rate.  The Assignee will also promptly remit to the
Assignor (x) any principal payments received from the Agent with respect to
Eurodollar Loans prior to the Payment Date, and (y) any amounts of interest on
Loans and fees received from the Agent which relate to the portion of the Loans
assigned to the Assignee hereunder for periods prior to the Effective Date, in
the case of Floating Rate Loans, or the Payment Date, in the case of Eurodollar
Loans, and not previously paid by the Assignee to the Assignor.]  In the event
that either party hereto receives any payment to which the other party hereto
is entitled under this Assignment Agreement, then the party receiving such
amount shall promptly remit it to the other party hereto.

*    Each Assignor may insert its standard payment provisions in lieu of the
payment terms included in this Exhibit.

2.5. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ASSIGNOR; LIMITATIONS ON THE ASSIGNOR'S
LIABILITY.  The Assignor represents and warrants that it is the legal and
beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder and that such
interest is free and clear of any adverse claim created by the Assignor.  It is
understood and agreed that the assignment and assumption hereunder are made
without recourse to the Assignor and that the Assignor makes no

Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
action under the Loan Documents, (c) appoints and authorizes the Agent to take

benefits and interests in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan
assets" under ERISA, [and (g) attaches the forms prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service of the United States certifying that the Assignee is entitled
to receive payments under the Loan Documents without deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes].*

*    to be inserted if the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States, or a state thereof.

2.7. INDEMNITY.  The Assignee agrees to indemnify and hold the Assignor
harmless against any and all losses, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) and liabilities incurred by the
Assignor in connection with or arising in any manner from the Assignee's
non-performance of the obligations assumed under this Assignment Agreement.
The obligations of the Assignee under this Section 7 shall survive the payment
of all amounts hereunder and the termination of this Agreement.

2.8. SUBSEQUENT ASSIGNMENTS.  After the Effective Date, the Assignee shall
have the right pursuant to and in accordance with Section 12.3 of the Credit
Agreement to assign the rights which are assigned to the Assignee hereunder to

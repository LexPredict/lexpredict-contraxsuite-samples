requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of
Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, the date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire
(which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such
Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other
information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter
of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, HHC, as agent for the Borrowers,
also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard
form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrowers shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $10,000,000
and (ii) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures at such time shall not
exceed the lesser of (i) the total Commitments at such time, and (ii) the
Borrowing Base at such time.

(c)   EXPIRATION DATE.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or
prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the
date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

(d) PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing
Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC
Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrowers on the
date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement
payment required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever.

(e) REIMBURSEMENT. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrowers shall reimburse
such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to
such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date
that such LC Disbursement is made, if HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, shall
have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by HHC, as agent
for the Borrowers, prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00
noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that HHC, as agent for the
Borrowers, receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately
following the day that HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, receives such notice, if
such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; PROVIDED
that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $100,000, the Borrowers hereby,
subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance
with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving
Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's
obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the
resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If the Borrowers fail to make such payment
when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC
Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrowers in respect thereof and
such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such
notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as
provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.06 shall apply, MUTATIS MUTANDIS, to the payment obligations of the Lenders),
and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts
so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrowers pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing
Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than
the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a
Loan and shall not relieve the Borrowers of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

(f) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Borrowers' obligations to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers' obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the


21
<PAGE>

circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
any Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

(g) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the
Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; PROVIDED that
any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the
Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with
respect to any such LC Disbursement.

(h)   INTERIM INTEREST.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrowers reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
PROVIDED that, if the Borrowers fail to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(c) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing
Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

(i) REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING BANK. The Issuing Bank may be
replaced at any time by written agreement among HHC, as agent for the Borrowers,
the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing
Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement
of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective,
the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights


22
<PAGE>

and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters
of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the
context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect
to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

(j) CASH COLLATERALIZATION. If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that HHC, as agent for the Borrowers,
receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if
the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure
representing greater than 66 2/3% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the
deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrowers shall
deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal
to 107% of LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon; PROVIDED that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall
become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of
Article VII. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as
collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers
under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other
than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments
shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and
at the Borrowers' risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.
Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such
account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been
reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction
of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such
time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the
consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 66 2/3% of the
total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers
under this Agreement. If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount of cash
collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such
amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the
Borrowers within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured
or waived.

Section 2.06  FUNDING OF BORROWINGS.

(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on
the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by
12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most
recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; PROVIDED
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The
Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrowers by promptly
crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrowers
maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the
Borrowers in the applicable Borrowing Request; PROVIDED that ABR Revolving Loans


23
<PAGE>

made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section
2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

Section 2.07  INTEREST ELECTIONS.

(a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type
specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar
Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrowers may elect to convert such Borrowing
to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as
provided in this Section. The Borrowers may elect different options with respect
to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion
shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which
may not be converted or continued.

(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, HHC, as agent for
the Borrowers, shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by
telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section
2.03 if the Borrowers were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type
resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.
Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be
confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a
written Interest Election Request, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT D
hereto, and signed by HHC, as agent for the Borrowers.

(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each
resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified


24
<PAGE>

pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
resulting Borrowing);

(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrowers shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(e) If the Borrowers fail to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies HHC, as agent for the
Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding
Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing
and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted
to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Section 2.08  TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

(a)   Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate
on the Maturity Date.

(b) The Borrowers may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Commitments; PROVIDED that (i) each reduction of the Commitments
shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $2,000,000 and (ii) the
Borrowers shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect
to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the
Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.

(c) HHC, as agent for Borrowers shall notify the Administrative
Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b)
of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by HHC,


25
<PAGE>

as agent for the Borrowers, pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
PROVIDED that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the HHC,
as agent for Borrowers may state that such notice is conditioned upon the
effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Borrowers (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any
termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction
of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
their respective Commitments.

Section 2.09  REPAYMENT OF LOANS; EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

(a) If on any date (whether or not such date is a date on which a
Borrowing Base Certificate is required to be furnished pursuant to Section
2.02(e) hereof) the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures shall exceed the
Borrowing Base, then the Borrowers shall prepay a principal amount of Loans
(prepaying outstanding Swingline Loans first, then any outstanding Revolving
Loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate, then any outstanding
Eurodollar Revolving Loans, then, to the extent any Letter of Credit is undrawn,
providing cash collateral therefor in accordance with the terms hereof) in an
aggregate amount not less than the amount by which the sum of the total
Revolving Credit Exposures shall exceed the Borrowing Base. Concurrently with
the delivery of any Borrowing Base Certificate which shows such an excess (and
at each other time when the Borrowers becomes aware of such an excess), the
Borrowers shall give notice to the Agent of such prepayment in accordance with
Section 2.10 hereof, which notice shall specify a prepayment date no later than
three Business Days after the date of delivery of such Borrowing Base
Certificate or, if an Event of Default exists, no later then the date of
delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate.

(b) The Borrowers hereby unconditionally promise to pay (i) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date, and (ii) to the Swingline
Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of
the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is
the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after
such Swingline Loan is made; PROVIDED that on each date that a Revolving
Borrowing is made, the Borrowers shall repay all Swingline Loans then
outstanding.

(c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

26
<PAGE>

(e) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; PROVIDED that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(f) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note. In such event, the Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

Section 2.10  PREPAYMENT OF LOANS.

(a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in
accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

(b) HHC, as agent for Borrowers, shall notify the Administrative
Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender)
by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case
of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in
the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in
the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York

shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or
portion thereof to be prepaid; PROVIDED that, if a notice of prepayment is given
in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as
contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if
such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly
following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would
be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type
as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be
applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments
shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

Section 2.11  FEES.

(a) The Borrowers, jointly and severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee which shall
accrue at the rate of 1/4% per annum on the daily average unused portion of the
facility until the later of the termination of the Commitment or until the
entire Revolving Credit Exposure has been paid or terminated in full. Accrued


27
<PAGE>

facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments
terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof;
PROVIDED that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments
terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

(b) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of each Lender, on the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit and on
the anniversary of each Letter of Credit (i) an annual letter of credit fee in
an amount equal to 1% of the face amount of each Letter of Credit, and (ii) the
Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.

(c) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent.

(d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be
refundable under any circumstances.

(e) The Borrowers, agree to pay to the Administrative Agent a
closing fee in the amount of $25,000 with respect to the credit facilities

Administrative Agent in full on the date hereof.

Section 2.12  INTEREST.

(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each
Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.

(b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Loan, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate
for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrowers hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans,
upon termination of the Commitments; PROVIDED that (i) interest accrued pursuant
to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event
of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR


28
<PAGE>

Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on
the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period
therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date
of such conversion.

(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base
Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate,
Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent,
and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Section 2.13  ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST.  If prior to the commencement of
any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as
applicable, for such Interest Period; or

(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders the
Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest
Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or
Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in
such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to HHC, as agent for the
Borrowers, and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies HHC, as agent for the
Borrowers, and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of
any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request
requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an
ABR Borrowing and PROVIDED that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice
affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be
permitted.

Section 2.14  INCREASED COSTS.

(a)   If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

29
<PAGE>

(ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London
interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or
participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in
Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital
of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence
of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit
held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a
level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the
policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender
or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section, together with reasonable detail related thereto, shall be
delivered to HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank
to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED
that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing
Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred
more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, notifies HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, of the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; PROVIDED FURTHER that,
if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

Section 2.15 BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. In the event of (a) the payment of
any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,

30
<PAGE>

continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to
Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each
Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of
a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been
applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last
day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, together with
reasonable detail related thereto, shall be delivered to HHC, as agent for the
Borrowers, and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

Section 2.16  TAXES.

(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrowers hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; PROVIDED that if the Borrowers shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the
case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall make such deductions and
(iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law; PROVIDED FURTHER, that
the payment of any taxes relating to any Property which is subject to the Real
Estate Security Documents shall be governed by the terms of the Real Estate
Security Documents.

(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(c) The Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for
the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or
with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers
hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest
and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or


31
<PAGE>

asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, by a
Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or
on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority, HHC, as agent for the
Borrowers, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment,
a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to HHC, as agent for the
Borrowers, (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers as will
permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

Section 2.17  PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SET-OFFS.

(a) The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC
Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or
otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in
immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 999 Broad Street,
Bridgeport, Connecticut, or such other address as the Administrative Agent shall
specify in writing, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in dollars.

(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed
LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be
applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

32
<PAGE>

(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or
Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater
proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the
proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of
other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments
shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount
of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; PROVIDED that (i) if any
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or
participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to
the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions
of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and
agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may
exercise against any Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, prior to the date on which any payment is due
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative
Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in
accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event,
if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or
the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation.

(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.17(d), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Section 2.18  MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if
the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending
office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in
the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate
or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be,
in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if
the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and
the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); PROVIDED that (i) HHC, as agent
for the Borrowers, shall have received the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank
and Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii)
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline
Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to
it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts)
and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

Section 2.19 APPOINTMENT OF HHC AND RELIANCE ON REPRESENTATIONS OF HHC.
Each Borrower hereby appoints HHC as its agent for all purposes hereunder, and
each Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may rely upon
any representations, warranty, certificate, notice, document or telephone
request which purports to be executed or made or which the Administrative Agent
or the Lenders in good faith believe to have been executed or made by HHC or any
of its executive officers, and each Borrower further agrees to indemnify and
hold the Administrative Agent and the Lenders harmless for any action, including
the making of Borrowings hereunder, and any loss or expense, taken or incurred
by any of them as a result of their good faith reliance upon any such
representations, warranty, certificate, notice, document or telephone request.
All obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement or any notes, instruments
or agreements entered in connection herewith, shall be joint and several
obligations of each of the Borrowers.

for such periods in accordance with GAAP.

35
<PAGE>

change in the business, assets, operations, prospects or condition, financial or
otherwise, of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 3.05  PROPERTIES.

(a) Each Borrower and its Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid
leasehold or subleasehold interests in, all its real and personal property
material to its business, except for minor defects in title that do not

utilize such properties for their intended purposes.

(b) Each Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use,
all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property
material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and its

any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.06  LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

(a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the
Borrowers, threatened against or affecting the Borrowers or any of their

individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other
than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the
Transactions.

(b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrowers nor any

Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any
Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,

continuing.

for which the Borrowers or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its
books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.10 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected
to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which
liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated

value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on
the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or any

or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrowers to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement or delivered hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other
information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; PROVIDED that,

to the same extent and on the same basis as historically provided to the

Section 5.01(a) so long as such Form 10-K as so adjusted shall contain the
information referred to in this Section 5.01(a);

(b) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal

powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank

provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or

Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as

wilful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for

relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise
its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their
respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative
Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and HHC, as agent for the
Borrowers. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right,
in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor. If no successor
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives
notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent
which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of
any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Section 9.02  WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS.

(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of
any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.



52
<PAGE>

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or by the Borrowers and
the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; PROVIDED that
no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or
LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan
or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or
reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the
scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of
each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner
that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the
written consent of each Lender, or (v) change any of the provisions of this
Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or
modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; PROVIDED FURTHER that no
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

Section 9.03  EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER.

(a) The Borrowers shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative
Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for
herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection
with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of
its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this
Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued
hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of
Credit.

(b) The Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan
or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal
by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if


53
<PAGE>

the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence
or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by
any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related
in any way to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; PROVIDED that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

(c) To the extent that the Borrowers fail to pay any amount required
to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees
to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as
the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time
that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such
unpaid amount; PROVIDED that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender in its capacity as such.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers shall
not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later
than three days after written demand therefor.

Section 9.04  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit), except that the Borrowers may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of their rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrowers without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

(b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); PROVIDED that (i)
except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender,
HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, and the Administrative Agent (and, in the case


54
<PAGE>

of an assignment of all or a portion of a Commitment or any Lender's obligations
in respect of its LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, the Issuing Bank and the
Swingline Lender) must give their prior written consent to such assignment
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in the case of
an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the
Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined
as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is
delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless
each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each
partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all
the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) the
parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500, (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire, and (vi) if an Event of
Default has not occurred, The Chase Manhattan Bank's Commitment shall not be
less than $10,000,000 (or if the aggregate Commitment is reduced, 40% of such
aggregate Commitment); and PROVIDED FURTHER that any consent of the Borrowers
otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of
Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of
the interest assigned by such Assignment and Accep tance, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall
be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of
this Section.

(c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrowers, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and


55
<PAGE>

Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

(e) Any Lender may, without the consent of HHC, as agent for the
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in
all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
PROVIDED that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; PROVIDED
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.

(f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrowers' prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless
HHC, as agent for the Borrowers, is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to
comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.

(g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

Section 9.05 SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrowers herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans
and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by
any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the


56
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 and Article
VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

Section 9.06 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 9.07 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

Section 9.08 RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers
against any of and all the obligations of the Borrowers now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although
such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

Section 9.09  GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS.

(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the law of the State of New York.


57
<PAGE>


(b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all
claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal
court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

(c) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to
in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

Section 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 9.11 HEADINGS. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

Section 9.12 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to
its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including
accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the


58
<PAGE>

Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrowers or (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the
Borrowers. For the purposes of this Section, "INFORMATION" means all information
received from the Borrowers relating to the Borrowers or their business, other
than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the
Borrowers; PROVIDED that, in the case of information received from any Borrower
after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of
delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.

Section 9.13 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such
Loan under applicable law (collectively the "CHARGES"), shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

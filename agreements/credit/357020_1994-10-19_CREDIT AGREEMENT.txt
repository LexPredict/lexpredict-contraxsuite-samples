CREDIT AGREEMENT
[Line of Credit Loans ]


THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of October 6, 1994 by and
between LTX CORPORATION, a Massachusetts corporation with its principal place
of business at LTX Park at University Avenue, Westwood, Massachusetts 02090
(the "BORROWER") and SILICON VALLEY BANK, a California-chartered bank, with its
principal place of business at 3000 Lakeside Drive, P.O. Box 3762, Santa Clara,
California 95054 with a loan production office located at Wellesley Office
Park, 45 William Street, Wellesley, Massachusetts 02181 doing business under
the name Silicon Valley East (the "Bank").

Section 1        Line of Credit Loans.

1.1     AMOUNT.  Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth below, the Bank agrees to make loans (each a "LINE OF
CREDIT LOAN" and collectively, the "LINE OF CREDIT LOANS") to the Borrower
under this Section 1.1 from time to time to and including December 4, 1995 (the
"COMMITMENT EXPIRATION DATE"), unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section
1.5, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding
the sum of $5,000,000 (the "LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENT"), subject to the
limitation set forth in Section 1.4.  Within the limit of the Line of Credit
Commitment, the Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow at any time or from
time to time until the Commitment Expiration Date, or the termination of the
Line of Credit Commitment, whichever occurs earlier.

1.2     LINE OF CREDIT NOTE.  The Line of Credit
Loans shall be evidenced by and payable with interest in accordance with the
note of the Borrower in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Bank, dated
today's date (the "Note").

1.3     REQUESTS FOR LINE OF CREDIT LOANS.  Whenever
the Borrower desires to obtain a Line of Credit Loan, it shall notify the Bank
by telex, telecopy or telephone received no later than 1:00 p.m. (Boston time)
one Banking Day before the day on which the requested Line of Credit Loan is to
be made.  Such notice shall specify the effective date and the amount of such
Loan.  Each such notice (a "NOTICE OF BORROWING") shall be irrevocable and
shall be immediately followed by a written Borrowing Certificate by the
Borrower in a form satisfactory to the Bank, provided, if such written
confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Bank,
the records of the Bank shall control absent manifest error.  The Bank shall
make such Line of Credit Loan by crediting its amount in immediately available
funds to the Borrower's regular deposit account with the Bank.

1.4     BORROWING BASE.  The Borrower shall not
permit, or request any advance or the issuance of any Letter of Credit
hereunder that would cause, the sum of (a) the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of all Line of Credit Loans under this Line of Credit Commitment and (b)
the aggregate Letter of Credit Usage (the sum of (a) and (b), the "Extensions
of Credit"), to exceed at any time an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the
Line of Credit Commitment or (ii) seventy-five percent (75%) of all Eligible
Domestic Accounts Receivable at such time (the "Borrowing Base").  If at any
time the aggregate principal amount of all Extensions of Credit exceeds the
Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall, on the next Banking Day, prepay such excess
principal amount together with accrued interest thereon at the applicable rate,
and if such excess is not eliminated thereby, the Borrower shall also pledge to
the Bank an amount by which the aggregate Extensions of Credit exceed the
Borrowing Base, in a manner acceptable to the Bank.

1.5     MATURITY DATE OF LINE OF CREDIT LOANS.  All
Line of Credit Loans shall mature and the total unpaid principal amount
thereunder shall be due and payable on December 5, 1995 (the "MATURITY DATE"),
at which time all amounts advanced under this Section 1 shall be immediately
due and payable.

<PAGE>   6



1.6     TERMINATION OF COMMITMENT.  The Borrower,
upon (a) at least two (2) Banking Days' prior written notice to the Bank and
(b) the repayment in full of the outstanding principal balance of the Line of
Credit Loans (and accrued interest thereon) and the payment in full of any
expenses or other fees owed by the Borrower to the Bank under or pursuant to
this Agreement, may elect to permanently terminate the Line of Credit
Commitment.

1.7     LETTERS OF CREDIT.  The Borrower may use up
to $1,000,000 of the Line of Credit Commitment for Letters of Credit to be
issued by the Bank, provided that in each case (a) the Borrower executes and
delivers a letter of credit application and reimbursement agreement
satisfactory to the Bank and complies with any conditions to the issuance of
such Letter of Credit (including payment of any applicable fees); (b) the Bank
has approved the form of such Letter of Credit and the purpose of its issuance;
(c) such Letter of Credit bears an expiration date not later than 45 days prior
to the Commitment Expiration Date; and (d) the conditions set forth in Sections
4.2 and 4.3 shall have been satisfied as of the date of the issuance of the
Letter of Credit.

Section 2        Interest Rates; Payments and Optional
Prepayments.

2.1     Interest Rates.

(a)     The Borrower agrees to pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Line of Credit Loan for each day from and
including the date such Line of Credit Loan was made to but excluding the date
the principal on such Line of Credit Loan is due (whether at maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise), at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the Prime
Rate plus 1%, which interest rate shall change when the Prime Rate shall
change.  Such interest shall be payable monthly in arrears on the last day of
each month commencing with the first such date hereafter and when the principal
amount of such Line of Credit Loan is due (whether at maturity, by acceleration
or otherwise).

(b)     Any overdue principal of any such Line of
Credit Loan and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest thereon,
shall, at the Bank's option, bear interest (after as well as before judgment),
payable on demand, for each day from and including the date payment was due to
but excluding the date of actual payment, at a fluctuating rate per annum equal
to five (5) percentage points above the rate of interest applicable under
Section 2.1(a) immediately prior to the occurrence of the delinquency.

2.2     MANNER AND PLACE OF PAYMENT.  All payments
under this Agreement or otherwise in respect of the Line of Credit Loans shall
be made not later than 2:00 p.m. (Boston Time) on the date when due and shall
be made in immediately available funds at the Office of the Bank or by the
Borrower's check drawn on the depositary account(s) maintained by the Borrower
with the Bank payable to the Bank or its order.  All payments shall be made
without setoff, counterclaim, withholding or reduction of any kind whatsoever.
Borrower will regularly deposit all funds received from its business activities
in accounts maintained by the Borrower at Bank's offices in California.  The
Bank may debit any account that the Borrower maintains with the Bank for any
principal, interest or fees then due on the Line of Credit Loans and any other
obligations owing by the Borrower to the Bank, without prior notice to the
Borrower, to the extent permitted by law, PROVIDED, however, the Bank agrees to
give prior notice (which may be telephone notice) prior to debiting such
account for fees, other than normal and customary banking charges, PROVIDED
FURTHER, however, that no consent of the Borrower shall be required in order
for the Bank to effect such debiting.  The Bank will notify the Borrower of all
debits which the Bank makes against the Borrower's accounts.  Any such debits
against the Borrower's accounts in no way shall be deemed a set-off.

2.3     PAYMENTS DUE ON SATURDAYS, SUNDAYS AND
HOLIDAYS.  Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under the Note shall be
due on a day which is not a Banking Day,

<PAGE>   7


such payment may be made on the next succeeding Banking Day, and such extension
of time shall be included in computing any interest or fees due.

2.4     OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS.  The Borrower shall
have the right to prepay the Line of Credit Loans in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty, at any time and from time to time, provided that at the
time of the prepayment in full of all Extensions of Credit, the Borrower shall
pay all interest accrued on the amount prepaid.  Principal amounts repaid or
prepaid under the Line of Credit Note or under the Line of Credit Commitment
may be reborrowed by the Borrower subject to the terms hereof; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any funds repaid or prepaid on or after the earlier to occur of
(a) the Commitment Expiration Date or (b) the termination of the Line of Credit
Commitment pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof, may not be reborrowed or readvanced
thereafter.

2.5     CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  If the Bank shall
determine that the adoption or implementation of any applicable law, rule,
regulation or treaty regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank (or its applicable lending
office) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital
of the Bank or any Person controlling the Bank (a "PARENT") as a consequence of
its obligations hereunder to a level below that which the Bank (or its Parent)
could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
deemed by the Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after
demand by the Bank the Borrower shall pay to the Bank such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate the Bank for such reduction.  A statement of the
Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional
amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive absent
manifest error; PROVIDED that the determination thereof is made on a reasonable
basis.

Section 3        Security.

3.1     SECURITY INTERESTS.  (a) The Borrower agrees
to grant to the Bank a security interest in, and a lien on, all right, title
and interest of the Borrower in and to the accounts receivable and inventory of
the Borrower and to enter a Security Agreement in favor of the Bank in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Bank (the "SECURITY AGREEMENT") in order to
secure payment and performance of the Borrower's obligations to the Bank under
this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents.

Section 4        Conditions Precedent.

The following conditions shall be satisfied on or before
October 31, 1994 or this Agreement shall be automatically terminated and of no
further force and effect.  In no event shall the Bank be obligated to make any
of the Line of Credit Loans to the Borrower hereunder unless and until the
following conditions have been satisfied:

4.1     THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTE AND THE SECURITY
INSTRUMENTS.  This Agreement, the borrowings hereunder, the Note, the Security

except that representations and warranties expressly limited to a certain date

5.1     CORPORATE STATUS.  The Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries (if any) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to do so would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

5.2     NO VIOLATION.  Neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, nor
consummation of the contemplated transactions will contravene any law, statute,
rule or regulation to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is subject
or any judgment, decree, franchise, order or permit applicable to the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, or will conflict or be inconsistent with or will
result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in or require
the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than the lien created by the
Security Instruments) upon any of the property or assets of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, or violate any provision of the corporate charter or
by-laws of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
subject to general principles of equity, whether applied in a court of equity
or at law.

5.5     GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS.  No order,
permission, consent, approval, license, authorization, registration or

performance of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, or
the taking of any action contemplated hereby or thereby, except for the filing
of UCC-1 financing statements in the appropriate UCC filing offices listed on
the Perfection Certificate (as defined in the Security Agreement).

5.6     Financial Statements.

(a)     The Borrower has furnished the Bank with
complete and correct copies of the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the Financial Statements Date, and the
related audited consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the
fiscal year of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries ended on such date, examined
by the Accountants.  Such financial statements (including the related schedules
and notes) fairly present the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries as of the Financial Statements Date, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal
year then ended.

(b)     The Borrower has furnished the Bank with
complete and correct copies of the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of July 31, 1994, and the related consolidated
statements of income and of cash flows for the 12-month period ended on such
date.  Such financial statements (including the related schedules and notes)
fairly present the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries as of July 31, 1994, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the 12-month period ended on
such date (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(c)     Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material liabilities, contingent or otherwise, including
liabilities for taxes or any unusual forward or long-term commitments or any
Guarantee, which are not disclosed by or included in the above-referenced
financial statements or the accompanying notes and there are no unrealized or
anticipated losses from any unfavorable commitments of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries which may have a Material Adverse Effect.  During the period
from July 31, 1994 to the date hereof:  (i) there has been no sale, transfer or
other disposition by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any material
part of its business or property and no purchase or other acquisition of any
business or property (including any capital stock of any Person) material in
relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries at July 31, 1994; and (ii) neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made a Restricted Payment, or agreed or committed to make a
Restricted Payment.

(d)     All the above-referenced financial statements
(including the related schedules and notes) have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as
approved by the Accountants and disclosed therein and, in the case of interim
financial statements, subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of
footnotes and schedules).

5.7     NO MATERIAL CHANGE.  Since July 31, 1994
there has been no development or event, nor to the best knowledge of the
Borrower, any prospective development or event, which has had or could have a
Material Adverse Effect.

5.8     LITIGATION.  There are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending or threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries before any Governmental Authority, which in any one case or in
the aggregate, if determined adversely to the interests of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary thereof, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.9     COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS; COMPLIANCE
WITH LAW.  Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof is in default under
(a) any Contractual Obligation, where such default could have a Material
Adverse Effect, or (b) the terms of any Contractual Obligation relating to any
Indebtedness of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.  Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary

<PAGE>   11


thereof is in default and or in violation of any applicable statute, rule,
writ, injunction, decree, order or regulation of any Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof which default
or violation could have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.10    SUBSIDIARIES.  The Borrower has no
Subsidiaries except as set forth on attached SCHEDULE A.

5.11    INVESTMENT BORROWER STATUS; LIMITS ON ABILITY
TO INCUR INDEBTEDNESS.  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an
"investment company" or a company "controlled by" an investment company within
the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  The Borrower is
not subject to regulation under any Federal or State statute or regulation
which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

5.12    TITLE TO PROPERTY.  The Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all of its properties and
assets, including the properties and assets reflected in the consolidated
balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the Financial
Statements Date, except such as have been disposed of since that date in the
ordinary course of business, and none of such properties or assets is subject
to any Lien except for (a) Permitted Liens, or (b) a defect in title or other
claim other than defects and claims that, in the aggregate, would have no
Material Adverse Effect.  The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all leases necessary in any material
respect for the operation of its properties and assets, none of which contains
any unusual or burdensome provisions which might materially affect or impair
such properties or assets.  All such leases are valid and subsisting and are in
full force and effect.

5.13    ERISA.  The Borrower and each member of the
Controlled Group have fulfilled their obligations under the minimum funding
standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan and are in compliance
in all material respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and
the Code, and have not incurred any liability to the PBGC or a Plan under Title
IV of ERISA (other than to make contributions or premium payments in the
ordinary course).

5.14    TAXES.  All tax returns of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries required to be filed have been timely filed, all taxes, fees
and other governmental charges (other than those being  contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and with respect to which
adequate reserves have been established and, in the case of AD VALOREM taxes or
betterment assessments, no proceedings to foreclose any lien with respect
thereto have been commenced and, in all other cases, no notice of lien has been
filed or other action taken to perfect or enforce such lien) shown thereon
which are payable have been paid.  The charges and reserves on the books of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries for all income and other taxes are adequate, and
the Borrower knows of no additional assessment or any basis therefor.  The
Federal income tax returns of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have not been
audited within the last three years, all prior audits have been closed, and
there are no unpaid assessments, penalties or other charges arising from such
prior audits.

5.15    Environmental Matters.

(a)     The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries
have obtained all Governmental Approvals that are required for the operation of
its business under any Environmental Law, except where the failure to so obtain
a Governmental Approval would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b)     The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries are
in compliance with all terms and conditions of all required Governmental
Approvals and are also in compliance with all terms and conditions of all
applicable Environmental Laws, the noncompliance with which would have a
Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>   12


(c)     There is no civil, criminal or administrative
action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, notice of violation, investigation,
proceeding, notice or demand letter pending or, to the best knowledge of the
Borrower threatened against the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof relating in
any way to the Environmental Laws, and there is no Lien of any private entity
or Governmental Authority against any property of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary thereof relating in any way to the Environmental Laws.

(d)     There has been no claim, complaint, notice,
or request for information received by the Borrower with respect to any site
listed on the National Priority List promulgated pursuant to the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") 42 USC
Section  9601 ET SEQ. or any state list of sites requiring investigation or
cleanup with respect to contamination by Hazardous Substances.

(e)     To the best of the Borrower's knowledge,
there has been no release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance at
any Borrower Property which would likely result in liability being imposed upon
the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof, which liability would have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.16    BORROWING BASE.  Giving effect to any
Extensions of Credit to be made as of the date hereof under this Agreement, the
aggregate amount of all Extensions of Credit under this Agreement does not
exceed the Borrowing Base on the date hereof.

Section 6        Affirmative Covenants.

which adequate reserves are maintained on the books of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries, in accordance with GAAP.

6.3     INSURANCE.  The Borrower will, and will cause

unless such transaction is otherwise permitted under this Agreement, is in the

Person not an Affiliate.

7.3     CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR ACQUISITION.  The
Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, merge or

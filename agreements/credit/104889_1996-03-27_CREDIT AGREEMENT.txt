Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a
Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of
this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance
made by such Swing Line Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business

(e)         Unless the Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender or Swing Line Bank prior to the date of any Revolving Credit
Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as the case may be, that such Lender or
Swing Line Bank will not make available to the Agent such Lender's or Swing
Line Bank's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line
Borrowing, as the case may be, the Agent may assume that such Lender or Swing
Line Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such
Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as the case may be, in
accordance with subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Lender or Swing Line Bank
shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender
or Swing Line Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until
the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Advances comprising
such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender or Swing Line Bank, the
Federal Funds Rate.  If such Lender or Swing Line Bank shall repay to the Agent
such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's
Revolving Credit Advance as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing or such
Swing Line Bank's Swing Line Advance as part of such Swing Line Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement.

(f)         The failure of any Lender or Swing Line Bank to
make the Revolving Credit Advance or Swing Line Advance to be made by it as
part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender or Swing Line Bank of
its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its





<PAGE>   25
20

Revolving Credit Advance or Swing Line Advance on the date of such Revolving
Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing as the case may be, but no Lender or
Swing Line Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender or
Swing Line Bank to make the Revolving Credit Advance or Swing Line Advance to
be made by such other Lender or Swing Line Bank on the date of any Revolving
Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, as the case may be.

SECTION 2.03.  The Competitive Bid Advances.  (a) Each
Lender severally agrees that the Borrower may make Competitive Bid Borrowings
under this Section 2.03 from time to time on any Business Day during the period
from the date hereof until the date occurring 30 days prior to the Termination
Date in the manner set forth below; provided that the amount of each
Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Unused
Commitments of the Lenders on such Business Day.

(i)         The Borrower may request a Competitive Bid
Borrowing under this Section 2.03 by delivering to the Agent, by
telecopier or telex, a notice of a Competitive Bid Borrowing (a
"Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing"), in substantially the
form of Exhibit B-2 hereto, specifying therein the requested (v)
date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, (w) aggregate
amount of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, (x) in the
case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate
Advances, Interest Period, or in the case of a Competitive Bid
Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate Advances, maturity date for
repayment of each Fixed Rate Advance to be made as part of such
Competitive Bid Borrowing (which maturity date may not be
earlier than the date occurring 30 days after the date of such
Competitive Bid Borrowing or later than the earlier of (I) 360
days after the date of such Competitive Bid Borrowing and (II)
the Termination Date), (y) interest payment date or dates
relating thereto, and (z) other terms (if any) to be applicable
to such Competitive Bid Borrowing, not later than 10:00 A.M.
(New York City time) (A) at least one Business Day prior to the
date of the proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, if the Borrower
shall specify in the Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing that
the rates of interest to be offered by the Lenders shall be
fixed rates per annum (the Advances comprising any such
Competitive Bid Borrowing being referred to herein as "Fixed
Rate Advances") and (B) at least four Business Days prior to the
date of the proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, if the Borrower
shall instead specify in the Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing
that the rates of interest be offered by the Lenders are to be
based on the LIBO Rate (the Advances comprising such Competitive
Bid Borrowing being referred to herein as "LIBO Rate Advances").
Each Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be irrevocable
and binding on the Borrower.  The Agent shall in turn promptly
notify each Lender of each request for a Competitive Bid
Borrowing received by it from the Borrower by sending such
Lender a copy of the related Notice of Competitive Bid
Borrowing.

(ii)        Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it
elects to do so, irrevocably offer to make one or more
Competitive Bid Advances to the Borrower as part of such
proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing at a rate or rates of
interest specified by such Lender in its sole discretion, by
notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Borrower), before 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the date
of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a
Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of Fixed Rate Advances and
before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) three Business Days
before the date of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in
the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate
Advances, of the minimum amount and maximum amount of each
Competitive Bid Advance which such Lender would be willing to
make as part of such proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing (which
amounts may, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of
this Section 2.03(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment), the rate
or rates of interest therefor and such Lender's Applicable
Lending Office with respect to such Competitive Bid Advance;
provided that if the Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall, in
its sole discretion, elect to make any such offer, it shall
notify the Borrower of such offer at least 30 minutes before the
time and on the date on which notice of such election is to be
given to the Agent by the other Lenders.  If any Lender shall
elect not to make such an offer, such Lender shall so notify the
Agent, before 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date on
which notice of such election is to be given to the Agent by the
other Lenders, and such Lender shall not be obligated to, and
shall not, make any Competitive Bid Advance as part of such
Competitive Bid Borrowing; provided that the failure by any
Lender to give such notice shall not cause such Lender to be
obligated to make any Competitive Bid Advance as part of such
proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing.

(iii)       The Borrower shall, in turn, before 10:30 A.M.
(New York City time) on the date of such proposed Competitive
Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid Borrowing
consisting of Fixed Rate Advances and before 11:00 A.M. (New
York City time) three Business Days before the date of such
proposed Competitive Bid Borrowing, in the case of a Competitive
Bid Borrowing consisting of LIBO Rate Advances, either:

(x) cancel such Competitive Bid Borrowing by
giving the Agent notice to that effect, or

(y) accept one or more of the offers made by any
Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its
sole discretion, by giving notice to the Agent of the
amount of each Competitive Bid Advance (which amount shall
be equal to or greater than the minimum amount, and equal
to or less than the maximum amount, notified to the
Borrower by the Agent on behalf of such Lender for such
Competitive Bid Advance pursuant to paragraph (ii) above)
to be made by each Lender as part of such Competitive Bid
Borrowing, and reject any remaining offers made by Lenders
pursuant to paragraph (ii) above by giving the





<PAGE>   27
22

Agent notice to that effect.  The Borrower shall accept the
offers made by any Lender or Lenders to make Competitive
Bid Advances in order of the lowest to the highest rates of
interest offered by such Lenders.  If two or more Lenders
have offered the same interest rate, the amount to be
borrowed at such interest rate will be allocated among such
Lenders in proportion to the amount that each such Lender
offered at such interest rate.

(iv)        If the Borrower notifies the Agent that such
Competitive Bid Borrowing is cancelled pursuant to paragraph
(iii)(x) above, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Lenders and such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not be
made.

(v)         If the Borrower accepts one or more of the
offers made by any Lender or Lenders pursuant to paragraph
(iii)(y) above, the Agent shall in turn promptly notify (A) each
Lender that has made an offer as described in paragraph (ii)
above, of the date and aggregate amount of such Competitive Bid
Borrowing and whether or not any offer or offers made by such
Lender pursuant to paragraph (ii) above have been accepted by
the Borrower, (B) each Lender that is to make a Competitive Bid
Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, of the amount
of each Competitive Bid Advance to be made by such Lender as
part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing, and (C) each Lender that
is to make a Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive
Bid Borrowing, upon receipt, that the Agent has received forms
of documents appearing to fulfill the applicable conditions set
forth in Article III.  Each Lender that is to make a Competitive
Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing shall,
before 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date of such
Competitive Bid Borrowing specified in the notice received from
the Agent pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding sentence or
any later time when such Lender shall have received notice from
the Agent pursuant to clause (C) of the preceding sentence, make
available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to
the Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds, such
Lender's portion of such Competitive Bid Borrowing.  Upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article
III and after receipt by the Agent of such funds, the Agent will
make such funds available to the Borrower at the Agent's address
referred to in Section 8.02.  Promptly after each Competitive
Bid Borrowing the Agent will notify each Lender of the amount of
the Competitive Bid Borrowing.

(vi)        If the Borrower notifies the Agent that it
accepts one or more of the offers made by any Lender or Lenders
pursuant to paragraph (iii)(y) above, such notice of acceptance
shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.  The Borrower
shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense
incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure to fulfill on
or before the date specified in the related Notice of
Competitive Bid Borrowing for such Competitive Bid Borrowing the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including,
without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of anticipated
profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation
or





<PAGE>   28
23

reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender
to fund the Competitive Bid Advance to be made by such Lender as
part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing when such Competitive Bid
Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

(b)         Each Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof and, following the making of each Competitive Bid Borrowing, the
Borrower shall be in compliance with the limitation set forth in the proviso to
the first sentence of subsection (a) above.

(c)         Within the limits and on the conditions set
forth in this Section 2.03, the Borrower may from time to time borrow under
this Section 2.03, repay or prepay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and
reborrow under this Section 2.03, provided that a Competitive Bid Borrowing
shall not be made within one Business Day of the date of any other Competitive
Bid Borrowing.

(d)         The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the
account of each Lender that has made a Competitive Bid Advance, on the maturity
date of each Competitive Bid Advance (such maturity date being that specified
by the Borrower for repayment of such Competitive Bid Advance in the related
Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i)
above and provided in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid
Advance), the then unpaid principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance.
The Borrower shall have no right to prepay any principal amount of any
Competitive Bid Advance unless, and then only on the terms, specified by the
Borrower for such Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive
Bid Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above and set forth in
the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance.

(e)         The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance from the date of such
Competitive Bid Advance to the date the principal amount of such Competitive
Bid Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such Competitive Bid
Advance specified by the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance in its
notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) above,
payable on the interest payment date or dates specified by the Borrower for
such Competitive Bid Advance in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above, as provided in the Competitive
Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance.  The Borrower shall pay
interest on the amount of overdue principal and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, interest in respect of each Competitive Bid Advance owing to
a Lender, payable in arrears on the date or dates interest is payable thereon,
at a rate per annum equal at all times to 1% per annum above the rate per annum
required to be paid on such Competitive Bid Advance under the terms of the
Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance unless otherwise
agreed in such Competitive Bid Note.





<PAGE>   29

(f)         The indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from
each Competitive Bid Advance made to the Borrower as part of a Competitive Bid
Borrowing shall be evidenced by a separate Competitive Bid Note of the Borrower
payable to the order of the Lender making such Competitive Bid Advance.

SECTION 2.04.  Fees.  (a)  Facility Fee.  The Borrower
agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee on the
aggregate amount of such Lender's Commitment in effect from time to time from
the Effective Date in the case of each Initial Lender and from the later of the
Effective Date and the effective date specified in the Assumption Agreement or
in the Assignment and Acceptance, as the case may be, pursuant to which it
became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date at
a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to
time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing March 31, 1996, and on the Termination Date.

(b)         Agent's Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for its own account such fees as may from time to time be agreed between
the Borrower and the Agent.

SECTION 2.05.  Termination, Reduction or Increase of the
Commitments. (a)  Termination or Reduction.  The Borrower shall have the right,
upon at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent, to terminate in whole
or reduce ratably in part the respective Unused Commitments of the Lenders,
provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of
$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  The
aggregate amount of the Commitments once reduced as provided in this Section
2.05(a), may not be reinstated, except as provided in Section 2.05(b) below.

(b)         Increase in Aggregate of the Commitments.  (i)
The Borrower may at any time, by notice to the Agent, propose that the
aggregate amount of the Commitments be increased (such aggregate amount being,
a "Commitment Increase"), effective as at a date prior to the Termination Date
(an "Increase Date") as to which agreement is to be reached by an earlier date
specified in such notice (a "Commitment Date"); provided, however, that (A) the
Borrower may not propose more than two Commitment Increases in any calendar
year, (B) the minimum proposed Commitment Increase per notice shall be
$25,000,000, (C) in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Commitments at
any time exceed $500,000,000, (D) the applicable Performance Level on such
Increase Date shall be Level I, Level II or Level III and (E) no Default shall
have occurred and be continuing on such Increase Date.  The Agent shall notify
the Lenders thereof promptly upon its receipt of any such notice.  The Agent
agrees that it will cooperate with the Borrower in discussions with the Lenders
and other Eligible Assignees with a view to arranging the proposed Commitment
Increase through the increase of the Commitments of one or more of the Lenders
(each such Lender that is willing to increase its Commitment hereunder being an
"Increasing Lender") and the addition of one or more other Eligible Assignees
as Assuming Lenders and as parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that
it





<PAGE>   30
25

shall be in each Lender's sole discretion whether to increase its Commitment
hereunder in connection with the proposed Commitment Increase; and provided
further that the minimum Commitment of each such Assuming Lender that becomes a
party to this Agreement pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), shall be at least
equal to $15,000,000.  If any of the Lenders agree to increase their respective
Commitments by an aggregate amount in excess of the proposed Commitment
Increase, the proposed Commitment Increase shall be allocated among such
Lenders in proportion to their respective Commitments immediately prior to the
Increase Date. If agreement is reached on or prior to the applicable Commitment
Date with any Increasing Lenders and Assuming Lenders as to a Commitment
Increase (which may be less than but not greater than specified in the
applicable notice from the Borrower), such agreement to be evidenced by a
notice in reasonable detail from the Borrower to the Agent on or prior to the
applicable Commitment Date, such Assuming Lenders, if any, shall become Lenders
hereunder as of the applicable Increase Date and the Commitments of such
Increasing Lenders and such Assuming Lenders shall become or be, as the case
may be, as of the Increase Date, the amounts specified in such notice; provided
that:

(x)         the Agent shall have received (with copies for
each Lender, including each such Assuming Lender) by no later
than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the applicable Increase
Date a certificate of a financial officer of the Borrower or the
Secretary of the Borrower, (1) stating that the resolutions
adopted by the Board of Directors of the Borrower on September
15, 1995 authorizing the Borrower to borrow money from time to
time in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
outstanding not in excess of $500,000,000 remain in full force
and effect and have not been modified or rescinded or attaching
and certifying, if applicable, any amendments to such
resolutions or supplemental borrowing resolutions and (2)
specifying the aggregate principal amount of borrowed money or
commitments of lenders to advance money under agreements entered
into pursuant to such resolutions (including any such
supplemental resolutions) other than this Agreement;

(y)         each such Assuming Lender shall have delivered
to the Agent, by no later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time)
on such Increase Date, an appropriate Assumption Agreement in
substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto, duly executed by
such Assuming Lender and the Borrower; and

(z)         each such Increasing Lender shall have
delivered to the Agent by, no later than 10:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on such Increase Date, (A) its existing Revolving
Credit Note and (B) confirmation in writing satisfactory to the
Agent as to its increased Commitment.

(ii)        In the event that the Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower as to its agreement to a Commitment Increase on or
prior to the applicable Commitment Date and each of the actions provided for in
clauses (x) through (z) above shall have occurred prior





<PAGE>   31
26

to 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the applicable Increase Date to the
satisfaction of the Agent, the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including any
Assuming Lenders) and the Borrower of the occurrence of such Commitment
Increase by telephone, confirmed at once in writing, telecopier, telex or cable
and in any event no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such Increase
Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to
each Increasing Lender and Assuming Lender. Each Increasing Lender and each
Assuming Lender shall, before 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the applicable
Increase Date, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office
to the Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds, in the case of such
Assuming Lender, an amount equal to such Assuming Lender's ratable portion of
the Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its
Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments outstanding after
giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) and, in the case of such
Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (i) such Increasing
Lender's ratable portion of the Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding
(calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate
Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment
Increase) over (ii) such Increasing Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving
Credit Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment (without
giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) as a percentage of the
aggregate Commitments (without giving effect to the relevant Commitment
Increase).  After the Agent's receipt of such funds from each such Increasing
Lender and each such Assuming Lender, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause
to be distributed like funds to the other Lenders for the account of their
respective Applicable Lending Offices in an amount to each other Lender such
that the aggregate amount of the outstanding Revolving Credit Advances owing to
each Lender after giving effect to such distribution equals such Lender's Pro
Rata Share of the Revolving Credit Borrowings then outstanding (calculated
based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments
outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase). Within
five Business Days after the Borrower receives notice from the Agent, the
Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent, Revolving
Credit Notes payable to the order of each Assuming Lender, if any, and, each
Increasing Lender, dated as of the applicable Increase Date, in a principal
amount equal to such Lender's Commitment after giving effect to the relevant
Commitment Increase, and substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto.  The
Agent, upon receipt of such Revolving Credit Notes, shall promptly deliver such
Revolving Credit Notes to the respective Assuming Lenders and Increasing
Lenders.

(iii)       In the event that the Agent shall not have
received notice from the Borrower as to such agreement on or prior to the
applicable Commitment Date or the Borrower shall, by notice to the Agent prior
to the applicable Increase Date, withdraw its proposal for a Commitment
Increase or any of the actions provided for above in clauses (i)(x) through
(i)(z) shall not have occurred by 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the such
Increase Date, such proposal by the Borrower shall be deemed not to have been
made.  In such event, any actions theretofore taken under clauses (i)(x)
through (i)(z) above shall be deemed to be of no effect and all the rights and
obligations of the parties shall continue as if no such proposal had been made.

SECTION 2.06.  Repayment.  (a)   Revolving Credit Advances.
The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders on
the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit
Advances then outstanding.

(b)         Swing Line Advances.  The Borrower shall repay
to the Agent for the account of the Swing Line Banks and each other Lender
which has made a Swing Line Advance the outstanding principal amount of each
Swing Line Advance made by each of them on the earlier of the maturity date
specified in the applicable Notice of Swing Line Borrowing (which maturity
shall be no later than five Business Days after the requested date of such
Borrowing) and the Termination Date.

SECTION 2.07.  Interest on Revolving Credit Advances and
Swing Line Advances.  (a)  Scheduled Interest.  The Borrower shall pay interest
on the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance and Swing Line
Advance owing to each Lender from the date of such Revolving Credit Advance or
Swing Line Advance, as the case may be, until such principal amount shall be
paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

(i)         Base Rate Advances.  During such periods as
such Revolving Credit Advance is a Base Rate Advance and for
each Swing Line Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to
the sum of (x) the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus
(y) the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time,  payable
in arrears quarterly on the last day of each March, June,
September and December during such periods and on the date such
Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full or Swing
Line Advance is paid in full.

(ii)        Eurodollar Rate Advances.  During such periods
as such Revolving Credit Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a
rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period
for such Revolving Credit Advance to the sum of (x) the
Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Revolving
Credit Advance plus (y) the Applicable Margin in effect from
time to time, payable in arrears on the last day of such
Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of
more than three months, on each day that occurs during such
Interest Period every three months from the first day of such
Interest Period and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance
shall be Converted or paid in full.

(b)         Default Interest.  The Borrower shall pay
interest on (i) overdue principal of each Revolving Credit Advance owing to
each Lender, payable in arrears on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or

rate per annum required to be paid on such Revolving Credit Advance pursuant to
clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law,
the amount of any overdue interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder, from
the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid





<PAGE>   33

in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and
on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 1% per annum above the
rate per annum required to be paid on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause
(a)(i) above.

SECTION 2.08.  Interest Rate Determination.  (a) Each
Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Agent timely information for the
purpose of determining each Eurodollar Rate and each LIBO Rate.  If any one or
more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the
Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Agent shall
determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by
the remaining Reference Banks.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the
Agent for purposes of Section 2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any,
furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the interest
rate under Section 2.07(a)(ii).

(b)         If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the Required Lenders notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for
any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to
such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective
Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so
notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance
will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance, and (ii) the obligation of the
Lenders to make, or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

(c)         If the Borrower shall fail to select the
duration of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance
with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section
1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month.

(d)         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default under Section 6.01(a), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance
will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the
Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended.

(e)         If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish
timely information to the Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate or LIBO
Rate for any Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case may
be, the Eurodollar Rate or the LIBO Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Advance or
LIBO Rate Advance, as the case may be, shall be an interest rate per annum
determined by the Agent to be the offered rate per annum at which deposits in
U.S. dollars appears on the Telerate Page 3750 (or any successor page) as of
11:00 A.M. (London time), or in the event such offered rate is not available
from the Telerate Page,





<PAGE>   34
29


(i)         the Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower
and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for
such Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances, as the case
may be,

(ii)        with respect to Eurodollar Rate Advances, each
such Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will
continue as a Base Rate Advance), and

(iii)       the obligation of the Lenders to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances or to Convert
Revolving Credit Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
exist.

SECTION 2.09.  Optional Conversion of Revolving Credit
Advances.  The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent
not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior
to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of
Sections 2.08 and 2.12, Convert all Revolving Credit Advances of one Type
comprising the same Borrowing into Revolving Credit Advances of the other Type;
provided, however, that any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar
Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified
in Section 2.02(b) and no Conversion of any Revolving Credit Advances shall
result in more separate Revolving Credit Borrowings than permitted under
Section 2.02(b).  Each such notice of a Conversion shall, within the
restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the
Revolving Credit Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such Conversion is into
Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each
such Advance.  Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on
the Borrower.

SECTION 2.10.  Optional Prepayments of Revolving Credit
Advances and Swing Line Advances.  The Borrower may, in the case of Eurodollar
Rate Advances, upon at least two Business Days' notice to the Agent, and in the
case of Base Rate Advances and Swing Line Advances, upon notice to the Agent
not later than 11:00 A.M. on the date of such proposed prepayment, stating in
each case the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment,
and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances comprising part of the same
Revolving Credit Borrowing or Swing Line Advances comprising part of the same
Swing Line Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
provided, however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of $5,000,000 for any Base Rate Advance or Swing Line Advance
or $10,000,000 for any Eurodollar Rate





<PAGE>   35
30

Advance or, in each case, an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof
and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the
Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 8.04(c).

SECTION 2.11.  Increased Costs.  (a)  If, after the date
hereof, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to any Lender (other than in respect of Eurocurrency Liabilities) of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances
(excluding for purposes of this Section 2.11 any such increased costs resulting
from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.14 shall govern) and (ii)
changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income
by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of
which such Lender is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any
political subdivision thereof), then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon
demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the
Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Lender for such increased cost.  A certificate as to the amount
of such increased cost, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis therefor
and the computation thereof, submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such
Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Lenders shall deliver the
notice and certificate described in this Section 2.11(a) to the Borrower in
respect of any increased costs except in accordance with the internal policy of
such Lender as to the exercise of similar rights and remedies in similar
circumstances.

(b)         If any Lender determines that compliance with
any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or
other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) in either
case enacted, adopted or made after the date hereof, affects or would affect
the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or
any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is
increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend
hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender
(with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent
for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender,
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation for
the reduction of the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital
of such corporation, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's
commitment to lend hereunder.  A certificate as to such amounts, setting forth
in reasonable detail the basis therefor and the computation thereof, submitted
to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Lenders shall deliver the notice and certificate described in this
Section 2.11(b) to the Borrower in respect of any requirements of additional
capital except in accordance with the internal policy of such Lender as to the
exercise of similar rights and remedies in similar circumstances.





<PAGE>   36

(c)         If any Lender shall give notice to the Agent
and the Borrower at any time to the effect that Eurocurrency Reserve
Requirements are, or are scheduled to become, effective and that such Lender is
or will be generally subject to such Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements (without
regard to whether such Lender will be able to benefit from proration or offsets
that may be available from time to time under Regulation D) as a result of
which such Lender will incur additional costs, then such Lender shall, for each
day from the later of the date of such notice and the date on which such
Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements become effective, be entitled to additional
interest on each Eurodollar Rate Advance made by it at a rate per annum
determined for such day (rounded upward to the nearest 100th of 1%) equal to
the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the Eurodollar Rate for such
Eurodollar Rate Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar
Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the then applicable Eurocurrency
Reserve Requirements.  Such additional interest will be payable in arrears to
the Agent, for the account of such Lender, on each date that interest is
payable on such Eurodollar Rate Advance.  Any Lender which gives a notice under
this paragraph (c) shall promptly withdraw such notice (by written notice of
withdrawal given to the Agent and the Borrower) in the event Eurocurrency
Reserve Requirements cease to apply to it or the circumstances giving rise to
such notice otherwise cease to exist.

(d)         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
contained, no Lender shall be entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant
to this Section 2.11 arising with respect to any period of time prior to the
date that is 60 days prior to the date on which notice of such claim and the
basis therefor is first given to the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.11.

SECTION 2.12.  Illegality. (a) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent that the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar Lending
Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or
LIBO Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate
Advances hereunder, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance, as
the case may be, of such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, Convert
into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest at the rate set
forth in Section 2.07(a)(i), as the case may be, and (ii) the obligation of
such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances or to
Convert Revolving Credit Advances into Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.  If any Lender shall
exercise its rights under this Section 2.12(a), all payments and prepayments of
principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Rate
Advances or LIBO Rate Advances that would have been made by such Lender or the
converted Eurodollar Rate Advances or LIBO Rate Advances of such Lender shall
instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Advances or Advances bearing interest
at the rate set forth in Section 2.07(a)(i), as the case may be, made by such
Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Rate
Advances or LIBO Rate Advances, and all distributions of payments





<PAGE>   37
32

in respect of interest shall be made to the Lenders ratably based on the
interest rates applicable to their respective Advances.

(b)  For purposes of this Section 2.12, a notice to the
Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Rate Advance or
LIBO Rate Advance, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently
applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Advance or LIBO Rate Advance; in all other
cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.13.  Payments and Computations.  (a)  The
Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes not later than
12:00 noon (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the
Agent at the Agent's Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of
principal or interest or facility fees ratably (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account
of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the
payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Upon its acceptance of an
Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained therein in
the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(c), from and after the effective date
specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments
hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to
the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and
Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods
prior to such effective date directly between themselves.  Upon any Assuming
Lender becoming a Lender hereunder as a result of the effectiveness of a
Commitment Increase pursuant to Section 2.05(b) and upon the Agent's receipt of
such Lender's Assumption Agreement and recording the information contained
therein in the Register, from and after the applicable Increase Date, the Agent
shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the
interest assumed thereby to the Assuming Lender.

(b)         All computations of interest based on the Base
Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate
or the Federal Funds Rate and of facility fees shall be made by the Agent on
the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period
for which such interest or facility fees are payable.  Each determination by
the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

(c)         Whenever any payment hereunder or under the
Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension
of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of
interest or facility fee, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such





<PAGE>   38
33

extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate
Advances or LIBO Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month,
such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(d)         Unless the Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may
assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such
date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then
due such Lender.  If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such
payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

SECTION 2.14.  Taxes.  (a)  Any and all payments by the
Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section
2.13, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the
Agent, taxes imposed on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on
it in lieu of net income taxes, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political
subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it in lieu of net income
taxes, by the jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any
political subdivision thereof, and further excluding, if any Lender is found as
the result of a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code) to be a conduit entity participating in a conduit financing
arrangement as defined in Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section
7701(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, the excess of the United States taxes
imposed with respect to such Lender over the amount of United States taxes that
would have been imposed with respect to such Lender if such determination had
not been made with respect to such Lender (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of
payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as
"Taxes").  If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the
Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii)
the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.





<PAGE>   39
34

(b)         In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any
present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or
under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing
under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c)         The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender and
the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.14) imposed on or paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may
be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto.  This indemnification shall be made within
30 days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes
written demand therefor.

(d)         Within 30 days after the date of any payment of
Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in
Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
thereof.  In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or on
behalf of the Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States
or by or on behalf of the Borrower by a payor that is not a United States
person, if the Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect
thereof, the Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to
the Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent
stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.  For purposes of this
subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "United States" and "United States
person" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

(e)         Each Lender organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its
execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and
on the date of the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance, as
the case may be, pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each
other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the
Borrower (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so),
shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal
Revenue Service forms 1001 or 4224, as appropriate, or any successor or other
form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is
exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes.  If the forms provided by a
Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate
a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding
tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such
Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies,
whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded
from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; provided, however, that, if at
the date of the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance, as the
case may be, pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this
Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in
respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such





<PAGE>   40
35

date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to
withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise
includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with
respect to the Lender assignee on such date.  If any form or document referred
to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than
information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on
the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form 1001 or 4224, that the Lender
reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof
to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document
such confidential information.

(f)         For any period with respect to which a Lender
has failed to provide the Borrower with the appropriate form described in
Section 2.14(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring
subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided,
or if such form otherwise is not required under the first sentence of
subsection (e) above), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification
under Section 2.14(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States
by reason of such failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become
subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder,
the Borrower shall take such steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to
assist the Lender to recover such Taxes.

(g)         Any Lender claiming any additional amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.14 agrees to use reasonable efforts
(consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the jurisdiction of its Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such
a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any additional
amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of
such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

SECTION 2.15.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender
shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise
of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Credit
Advances or Swing Line Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section
2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of
the Revolving Credit Advances or Swing Line Advances obtained by all the
Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Revolving Credit Advances or Swing Line Advances owing to
them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess
payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing
Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall
repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such
recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in
respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender
so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15
may, to the fullest extent





<PAGE>   41
36

permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the
direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.16.  Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of the
Advances shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such
proceeds) for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries,
including acquisitions and stock repurchases.

with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders, such

to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided,

such tax, assessment, charge or claim that is being contested in
good faith and by proper proceedings and as to which appropriate

grace period, if any, specified in the agreement or instrument
relating to such Debt; or any other event shall occur or
condition shall exist under any agreement or instrument relating

(e)         The Borrower or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries shall generally not pay its debts as such debts
become due, or shall admit in writing its inability to pay its

shall be rendered against the Borrower or any of its Significant

been legally commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or
order or (ii) there shall be any period of 60 consecutive days
during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by
reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect
provided, however, that any such judgment or order shall not be
an Event of Default under this Section 6.01(f) if and for so
long as (x) the amount of such judgment or order is covered by a
valid and binding policy of insurance between the defendant and

notified of, and has not disputed the claim made for payment of,
the amount of such judgment or order; or

(g)         (i) Any Person or two or more Persons acting in

Borrower (or other securities convertible into such Voting
Stock) representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of
all Voting Stock of the Borrower and such combined voting power
exceeds the

46

then current voting power of the Voting Stock of the Borrower
(or other securities convertible into such Voting Stock)
controlled by the Graham Interests; or (ii) Continuing Directors
of the Borrower shall cease for any reason to constitute a

following:  (i) the occurrence of any ERISA Event; (ii) the
partial or complete withdrawal of the Borrower or any of its
ERISA Affiliates from a Multiemployer Plan; or (iii) the
reorganization or termination of a Multiemployer Plan; and, in
the reasonable opinion of the Required Lenders, such incurrence
would be likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, provided
that any such liability in an amount not to exceed $20,000,000
shall be deemed not to be likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect;

then, and in any such event, the Agent (i) shall at the request, or may with
the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrower, declare the
obligation of each Lender to make Advances to be terminated, whereupon the same
shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at the request, or may with the

expressly waived by the Borrower; provided, however, that in the event of an
actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower
under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (A) the obligation of each Lender to make
Advances shall automatically be terminated and (B) the Notes, all such interest
and all such amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by the Borrower.

ARTICLE VII

THE AGENT

SECTION 7.01.  Authorization and Action.  Each Lender
hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are
delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.  As to any matters not
expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Agent shall not be required to
exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to
refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining
from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such
instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes;
provided, however, that the Agent shall not





<PAGE>   52
47

be required to take any action that exposes the Agent to personal liability or
that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law.  The Agent agrees to give
to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 7.02.  Agent's Reliance, Etc.  Neither the Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with
this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct.  Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:
(i) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Agent
receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender
that is the payee of such Note, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as
assignee, as provided in Section 8.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel
(including counsel for the Borrower), independent public accountants and other
experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted
to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with  the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender
and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties or
representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this

performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this
Agreement on the part of the Borrower or to inspect the property (including the
books and records) of the Borrower; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender
for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in
respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or
other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier, telegram or telex)
reasonably believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party
or parties.

SECTION 7.03.  Citibank and Affiliates.  With respect to
its Commitment, the Advances made by it and the Note issued to it, Citibank
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term
"Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include
Citibank in its individual capacity.  Citibank and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept
investment banking engagements from and generally engage in any kind of
business with, the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and any Person who may do
business with or own securities of the Borrower or any such Subsidiary, all as
if Citibank were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.

SECTION 7.04.  Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section
4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate





<PAGE>   53
48

at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.05.  Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to
indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably
according to the respective principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Notes
then held by each of them (or if no Revolving Credit Notes are at the time
outstanding or if any Revolving Credit Notes are held by Persons that are not
Lenders, ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitments),
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement, provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to
reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower.

SECTION 7.06.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at
any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and
may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders.  Upon
any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30
days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Required
Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf
of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank
organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State
thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and
the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under
this Agreement.  After any retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement.

SECTION 7.07.  Co-Agent.  Wachovia has been designated as
Co-Agent in recognition of its Commitment, and the use of such title does not
impose on Wachovia any duties or obligations greater than those of any other
Lender.

full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under
the Notes.

SECTION 8.05.  Right of Set-off.  Upon (i) the occurrence
and during the continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the
request or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize
the Agent to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6.01, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at
any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set
off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing
by such Lender or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement and the Note held by such Lender,
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or
such Note and although such obligations may be unmatured.  Each Lender agrees
promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such set-off and application.  The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including,
without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender and its
Affiliates may have.

SECTION 8.06.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall become
effective (other than Sections 2.01 and 2.03, which shall only become effective
upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01) when
it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the Agent and when the Agent
shall have been notified by each Initial Lender that such Initial Lender has
executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and
assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the
Lenders.

SECTION 8.07.  Assignments and Participations.  (a) Each
Lender may with the consent of the Agent and the Borrower (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or





<PAGE>   57
52

delayed) and, if demanded by the Borrower (following a demand by such Lender
pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.14 or following such Lender's Downgrade) at a
time when no Default has occurred and is continuing upon at least five Business
Days' notice to such Lender and the Agent, will assign to one or more Persons
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Revolving Credit
Advances owing to it and the Revolving Credit Note or Notes held by it);
provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and
not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement
(other than any right to make Competitive Bid Advances, Competitive Bid
Advances owing to it and Competitive Bid Notes), (ii) except in the case of an
assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender
or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned
pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than
$10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and the
amount of the Commitment of such Lender remaining after such assignment shall
not be less than $10,000,000 or shall be zero, (iii) each such assignment shall
be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a
demand by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 8.07(a) shall be arranged by
the Borrower after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an
assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under
this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations
made concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that
together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under
this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as
a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 8.07(a) unless
and until such Lender shall have received one or more payments from either the
Borrower or one or more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least
equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to
such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of
such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this
Agreement, and (vi) unless such assignment is demanded by the Borrower, the
parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance,
together with any Revolving Credit Note subject to such assignment and a
processing and recordation fee of $3,000.  Upon such execution, delivery,
acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to
it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations
of a Lender hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from
its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto).





<PAGE>   58

(b)         By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm
to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i)
other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender
makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect
to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with
this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or observance by the
Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument
or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has
received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial
statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to
enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is
an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to
take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms
hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental
thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

(c)         Upon its receipt of an Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it
is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Revolving Credit Note or Notes
subject to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance
has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.
Within five Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at
its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the
surrendered Revolving Credit Note a new Note to the order of such Eligible
Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a
Commitment hereunder, a new Revolving Credit Note to the order of the assigning
Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder.  Such new
Revolving Credit Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Revolving Credit Note or
Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and
shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto.

(d)         The Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it and a register for the





<PAGE>   59
54

recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time
(the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e)         Each Lender may sell participations to one or
more banks or other entities (other than the Borrower or any of its Affiliates)
in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) with the consent of the
Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall
remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the
Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such
participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by the
Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent
would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other
amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation.

(f)         Any Lender may, in connection with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to
this Section 8.07, disclose to the assignee  or participant or proposed
assignee or participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to
such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such
disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
relating to the Borrower received by it from such Lender.

(g)         Notwithstanding any other provision set forth
in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor
of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Lender shall disclose any Confidential Information to any other Person without
the consent of the Borrower, other than (a) to the Agent's or such Lender's
Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, accountants, auditors,
counsel, agents and advisors and, as contemplated by Section 8.07(f), to actual
or prospective assignees and participants, and then only on a confidential
basis, (b) as required by any law, rule or regulation or judicial process, (c)
to any rating agency when required by it, provided that, prior to any such
disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the confidentiality

such Lender and (d) as requested or required by any state, federal or foreign
authority or examiner regulating banks or banking.

hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or
federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Notes, or for recognition or enforcement of
any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State court or, to
the extent permitted by law, in such federal court.  Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect

relating to this Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction.

(b)         Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Notes in any New York State or federal court.  Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.





<PAGE>   61

SECTION 8.12.  Waiver of Jury Trial.  Each of the Borrower,
the Agent and the Lenders hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury
in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes or the
actions of the Agent or any Lender in the negotiation, administration,
performance or enforcement thereof.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized, as of the date first above written.

OPINION OF COUNSEL
FOR THE BORROWER


[Effective Date]



To each of the Lenders parties
to the Credit Agreement dated
as of January 31, 1996 among
The Washington Post Company,
said Lenders, Citibank, N.A., as
Agent for said Lenders, and
Wachovia Bank of Georgia, N.A.,
as Co-Agent, to Citibank, N.A.,
as Agent,and to Wachovia Bank of
Georgia, N.A., as Co-Agent


The Washington Post Company


Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section
3.01(h)(iv) of the Credit Agreement, dated as of January 31, 1996 (the "Credit
Agreement"), among The Washington Post Company (the "Borrower"), the Lenders
parties thereto, Citibank, N.A., as Agent for said Lenders, and Wachovia Bank
of Georgia, N.A., as Co-Agent.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used
herein as therein defined.

I am the General Counsel of the Borrower and as such I am
familiar with the Credit Agreement and the corporate proceedings taken by the
Borrower to authorize the execution and delivery of  the Credit Agreement.

For purposes of this opinion, I have examined:

(1)      The Credit Agreement.

(2)      The documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to
Article III of the Credit Agreement.





<PAGE>   85
2

(3)      The Certificate of Incorporation of the Borrower and
all amendments thereto (the "Charter").

(4)      The by-laws of the Borrower and all amendments
thereto (the "By-laws").

(5)      A certificate of the Secretary of State of Delaware,
dated _______________, 199_, attesting to the continued corporate existence
and good standing of the Borrower in that State.

In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies
certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower,
certificates of public officials and of officers of the Borrower, and
agreements, instruments and other documents, as I have deemed necessary as a
basis for the opinions expressed below.  As to questions of fact material to
such opinions, I have, when relevant facts were not independently established
by me, relied upon certificates of the Borrower or its officers or of public
officials.  I have assumed the due execution and delivery, pursuant to due
authorization, of the Credit Agreement by the Initial Lenders, the Agent and
the Co-Agent.

My opinions expressed below are limited to the law of the
State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the
Federal law of the United States.

Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have
deemed necessary, I am of the following opinion:

1.       The Borrower is a corporation validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

2.       The execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Borrower's corporate
powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do
not contravene (i) the Charter or the By-laws or (ii) any law, rule or
regulation applicable to the Borrower (including, without limitation,
Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or
(iii) to the best of my knowledge after appropriate inquiry, (x) any
contractual restriction or (y) any legal restriction contained in orders,
writs, judgments, awards, injunctions or decrees applicable to the Borrower
or its assets, in each case that affects or purports to affect the
Borrower's right to borrow money or the Borrower's obligations under the
Credit Agreement or Notes. The Credit Agreement and the Notes delivered on
the date hereof have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the
Borrower.





<PAGE>   86

3.       No authorization, approval or other action by, and no
notice to or filing with, any United States Federal, New York or, to the
extent required under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
Delaware governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due
execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement
and the Notes.

4.       The Credit Agreement is, and when executed and
delivered in connection with Borrowings, the Notes will be, legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in
accordance with their respective terms.

5.       To the best of my knowledge after appropriate
inquiry, there are no pending or overtly threatened actions or proceedings
against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court,
governmental agency or arbitrator that purport to affect the legality,
validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any
of the Notes or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby
or that are likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial
condition or operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

The opinions set forth above are subject to the following
qualifications:

(a)      My opinion in paragraph 4 above as to enforceability
is subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency
(including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights
generally.

(b)      My opinion in paragraph 4 above as to enforceability
is subject to the effect of general principles of equity, including,
without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law).

(c)      Insofar as provisions contained in the Credit
Agreement provide for indemnification, the enforceability thereof may be
limited by public policy considerations.

(d)      I express no opinion as to (i) Section 2.15 of the
Credit Agreement insofar as it provides that any Lender purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or
similar rights with respect to such participation and (ii) the effect of
the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein any
Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the
Notes may be sought that limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or
collectible.

I am aware that Shearman & Sterling will rely upon the

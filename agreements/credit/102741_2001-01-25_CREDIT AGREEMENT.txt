proportion to their respective Commitments. Within the foregoing limits, the
Borrower may borrow under this Section, repay or, to the extent permitted by
Section 2.10, prepay Syndicated Loans and reborrow under this Section at any
time before the Termination Date.

SECTION 2.02. Method of Borrowing Syndicated Loans.

(a) The Borrower shall give the Agent notice in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit L (a "Notice of Borrowing") prior to 11:00 A.M.
(Atlanta, Georgia time) at least 3 Foreign Currency Business Days before each
Syndicated Foreign Currency Borrowing, prior to 12:00 noon (Atlanta, Georgia
time) at least 3 Euro-Dollar Business Days before each Euro-Dollar Borrowing and
prior to 12:00 noon (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the Domestic Business Day of each
Base Rate Borrowing, specifying:

(i) the date of such Syndicated Borrowing, which
shall be a Domestic Business Day in the case of a Base Rate
Borrowing, a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a
Euro-Dollar Borrowing and a Foreign Currency Business Day in
the case of a Syndicated Foreign Currency Borrowing,

(ii) the aggregate amount of such Syndicated
Borrowing,

(iii) whether the Syndicated Loans comprising such
Syndicated Borrowing are to be Dollar Loans or Syndicated
Foreign Currency Loans, and (A) if such Syndicated Loans are
to be Dollar Loans, whether they are to be Base Rate Loans or
Euro-Dollar Loans, and (B) if such Syndicated Loans are to be
Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, specifying the Foreign
Currency, and

(iv) in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, the
duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to
the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

(b) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall
promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable
share of such Syndicated Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

(c) Not later than 11:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the
date of each Syndicated Foreign Currency Borrowing and each Euro-Dollar
Borrowing and not later than 2:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date of
each Base Rate Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as provided in subsection (d)
of this Section) make available its ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing,
in Federal or other funds immediately available in Atlanta, Georgia, to the
Agent at its address referred to in or specified pursuant to Section 9.01(or,
with respect to Syndicated Foreign Currency Borrowings, to the Agent's
designated foreign correspondent bank at the address specified by the Agent),
which funds shall be in Dollars, if such Syndicated Borrowing is a Syndicated
Dollar Borrowing, and in the applicable Foreign Currency, if such Syndicated
Borrowing is a Syndicated Foreign Currency Borrowing. Unless the Agent

<PAGE>


address not later than 4:30 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date of the
relevant Syndicated Borrowing. Unless the Agent receives notice from a Bank, at
the Agent's address referred to in Section 9.01, no later than 4:00 P.M. (local
time at such address) on the Domestic Business Day before the date of a
Syndicated Borrowing stating that such Bank will not make a Syndicated Loan in
connection with such Syndicated Borrowing, the Agent shall be entitled to assume
that such Bank will make a Syndicated Loan in connection with such Syndicated
Borrowing and, in reliance on such assumption, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) make available such Bank's ratable share of such Syndicated
Borrowing to the Borrower for the account of such Bank. If the Agent makes such
Bank's ratable share available to the Borrower and such Bank does not in fact
make its ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing available on such date, the
Agent shall be entitled to recover such Bank's ratable share from such Bank or
the Borrower (and for such purpose shall be entitled to charge such amount to
any account of the Borrower maintained with the Agent), together with interest
thereon for each day during the period from the date of such Syndicated
Borrowing until such sum shall be paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the
rate at which the Agent determines that it obtained (or could have obtained)
overnight Federal funds to cover such amount for each such day during such
period, provided that any such payment by the Borrower of such Bank's ratable
share and interest thereon shall be without prejudice to any rights that the
Borrower may have against such Bank. If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's
Syndicated Loan included in such Syndicated Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

(d) If any Bank makes a new Syndicated Loan hereunder to the
Borrower on a day on which such Borrower is to repay all or any part of an
outstanding Syndicated Loan from such Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds
of its new Syndicated Loan to make such repayment and only an amount equal to
the difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and the amount being
repaid shall be made available by such Bank to the Agent as provided in
subsection (c) of this Section, or remitted by the Borrower to the Agent as
provided in Section 2.12, as the case may be; provided, however, if the Loan
which is to be repaid is a Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan, the foregoing
provisions of the paragraph shall apply only if the new Loan is to be made in
the same Foreign Currency.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no Fixed Rate Borrowing may be made if there shall have occurred a
Default or an Event of Default, which Default or Event of Default shall not have
been cured or waived in writing.

(f) In the event that a Notice of Borrowing fails to specify
whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans,
Euro-Dollar Loans or Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, such Loans shall be made
as Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower is otherwise entitled under this Agreement
to repay any Syndicated Loans maturing at the end of an Interest Period
applicable thereto with the proceeds of a new Borrowing, and such Borrower fails
to repay such Syndicated Loans using its own moneys and fails to give a Notice
of Borrowing in connection with such new Borrowing, a new Syndicated Borrowing
shall be deemed to be made on the date such Syndicated Loans mature in an amount
equal to the principal amount of the Syndicated Loans so maturing, and the
Syndicated Loans comprising such new Borrowing shall be Base Rate Loans, which
shall be made in the Dollar Equivalent of such maturing Syndicated Loans, if
such maturing Syndicated Loans were Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
(i) there shall not be more than 10 different Interest Periods outstanding at
the same time for Fixed Rate Loans (for which purpose Interest Periods described
in different numbered clauses of the definition of the term "Interest Period"
shall be deemed to be different Interest Periods even if they are coterminous)
and (ii) the proceeds of any Base Rate Borrowing shall be applied first to repay
the unpaid principal amount of all Base Rate Loans (if any) outstanding
immediately before such Base Rate Borrowing.

Market Loan; and

(D) the identity of the quoting Bank.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Agent and the Borrower, no Money Market Quote
shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or propose terms other
than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Money Market Quote
Request (other than setting forth the maximum principal amount of the Money
Market Loan which the quoting Bank is willing to make for the applicable
Interest Period).

(d) The Agent shall as promptly as practicable after the Money
Market Quote is submitted (but in any event not later than 10:30 A.M. (Atlanta,
Georgia time) notify the Borrower of the terms (i) of any Money Market Quote
submitted by a Bank that is in accordance with Section 2.03(c) and (ii) of any
Money Market Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a
previous Money Market Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same
Money Market Quote Request. Any such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be
disregarded by the Agent unless such subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted
solely to correct a manifest error in such former Money Market Quote. The
Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify (A) the maximum aggregate principal
amount of the Money Market Borrowing for which offers have been received and (B)
the maximum principal amount and Money Market Rates so offered by each Bank
(identifying the Bank that made each Money Market Quote).

(e) Not later than 11:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the
Quotation Date (or such other time and date as the Borrower and the Agent, with
the consent of the Required Banks, may agree), the Borrower shall notify the
Agent of its acceptance or nonacceptance of the offers so notified to it
pursuant to Section 2.03(d) and the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank that
has submitted a Money Market Quote. In the case of acceptance, such notice shall
specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that
are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Money Market Quote in whole or in part
(provided that any Money Market Quote accepted in part from any Bank shall not
be less than the amount set forth in the Money Market Quote of such Bank as the
minimum principal amount of the Money Market Loan such Bank was willing to make
for the applicable Interest Period); provided that:

<PAGE>


(i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money
Market Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set
forth in the related Money Market Quote Request;

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Money
Market Borrowing shall be at least $5,000,000 (and in larger
multiples of $1,000,000) but shall not cause the limits
specified in Section 2.03(a) to be violated;

(iii) acceptance of offers may only be made in
ascending order of Money Market Rates; and

(iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer where the
Agent has advised such Borrower that such offer fails to
comply with Section 2.03(c)(ii) or otherwise fails to comply
with the requirements of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 2.03(a)).

If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same Money Market Rates for a
greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers
are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Money
Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by
the Borrower among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of $100,000)
in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers. Determinations
by the Borrower of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

(f) Any Bank whose offer to make any Money Market Loan has
been accepted shall, not later than 12:00 noon (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the
Quotation Date, make the amount of such Loan available to the Agent at its
address referred to in Section 9.01 in immediately available funds. The amount
so received by the Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, be made available to the Borrower on such date by depositing the
same, in immediately available funds, in an account of such Borrower maintained
with Wachovia.

SECTION 2.04. Notes.

(a) The Syndicated Dollar Loans of each Bank shall be
evidenced by a single Syndicated Dollar Note and the Syndicated Foreign Currency
Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced by a single Syndicated Foreign Currency
Note, each payable to the order of such Bank for the account of its Lending
Office in an amount equal to the original principal amount of such Bank's
Commitment.

(b) The Money Market Loans made by any Bank to the Borrower
shall be evidenced by a single Money Market Note payable to the order of such
Bank for the account of its Lending Office.

(c) Upon receipt of each Bank's Notes pursuant to Section
3.01, the Agent shall deliver such Notes to such Bank. Each Bank shall record,
and prior to any transfer of its Notes shall endorse on the schedule forming a
part thereof appropriate notations to evidence, the date, amount and maturity
of, and effective interest rate for, each Loan made by it, the date and amount
of each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto and
whether, in the case of such Bank's Syndicated Dollar Note, such Syndicated
Dollar Loan is a Base Rate Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan, and, in the case of such
Bank's Syndicated Foreign Currency Note, specification of the Foreign Currency,
and such schedule shall constitute rebuttable presumptive evidence of the
principal amount owing and unpaid on such Bank's Notes; provided that the
failure of any Bank to make, or any error in making, any such recordation or
endorsement shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under
the Notes or the ability of any Bank to assign its Notes. Each Bank is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to endorse its Notes and to attach to
and make a part of any Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when
required. In order to verify the Loans outstanding from time to time, the Agent
shall furnish the Parent, upon request of the Parent, with a copy of its record
of transactions under this Agreement.

<PAGE>


SECTION 2.05. Maturity of Loans. Each Loan included in any Borrowing
(including without limitation each Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan deemed made
under this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.14) shall mature, and the principal
amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable to such Borrowing or such Loan.

SECTION 2.06. Interest Rates. (a) "Applicable Margin" means:

and including the first Performance Pricing Determination
Date, (x) for any Base Rate Loan, 0.00%, (y) for any
Euro-Dollar Loan, 0.65%, and (z) for any Syndicated Foreign
Currency Loan, 0.65%; and

(ii) from and after the first Performance Pricing
Determination Date, (x) for any Base Rate Loan, 0.00%, and (y)
for each Euro-Dollar Loan and Syndicated Foreign Currency

below, based upon the ratio of Consolidated Debt to
Consolidated EBITDA (calculated as of the last day of each
Fiscal Quarter) or, but only if the Parent has Rated Debt
outstanding, the Debt Rating:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S>                      <C>               <C>                        <C>                        <C>
Ratio of Consolidated    Less than         Greater than or equal      Greater than or equal      Greater than or equal
Debt to Consolidated     1.75 to 1.00      to 1.75 to 1.00 and        to 2.25 to 1.00 and        to 2.75 to 1.00
EBITDA                                     Less than 2.25 to 1.00     Less than 2.75 to 1.00

</TABLE>

provided, that if on any Performance Pricing Determination Date on which the
Parent has Rated Debt outstanding (i) application of the Consolidated Debt to
Consolidated EBITDA ratio test only would result in a lower Applicable Margin
than application of the Debt Rating test only, the Applicable Margin shall be
determined based upon the Level next lower than the Level determined based upon
the Debt Rating test only, and (ii) if the Debt Rating received from any of (A)
Duff & Phelps is "BB" or lower, (B) Fitch is "B" or lower, (C) Moody's is "Ba2"
or lower, and (D) S&P is "BB" or lower, then the Applicable Margin shall be
1.05%.

(b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it
becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day plus the
Applicable Margin. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on
the last day thereof. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, overdue interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest,
payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the
Default Rate.

<PAGE>


(c) Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the
applicable Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period;
provided that if any Euro-Dollar Loan shall, as a result of clause (1)(c) of the
definition of Interest Period, have an Interest Period of less than one month,
such Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest during such Interest Period at the
rate applicable to Base Rate Loans during such period. Such interest shall be
payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest
Period is longer than 3 months, at intervals of 3 months after the first day
thereof. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, overdue interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on
demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Interest Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded
upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100th of 1%) by dividing (i) the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period by (ii) 1.00
minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any
Euro-Dollar Loan means for the Interest Period of such Euro-Dollar Loan the rate
per annum determined on the basis of the rate for deposits in Dollars of amounts
equal or comparable to the principal amount of such Euro-Dollar Loan offered for
a term comparable to such Interest Period, which rate appears on the display
designated as Page "3750" of the Telerate Service (or such other page as may
replace page 3750 of that service or such other service or services as may be
nominated by the British Banker's Association for the purpose of displaying
London Interbank Offered Rates for U.S. dollar deposits) determined as of 1:00
p.m. New York City time, 2 Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the first day of
such Interest Period.

"Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that
percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as
prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any
successor) for determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of
the Federal Reserve System in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in
respect of any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by
reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any
category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a
non-United States office of any Bank to United States residents). The Adjusted
London Interbank Offered Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
effective date of any change in the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

(d) Each Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan shall bear interest
on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the
applicable Adjusted IBOR Rate for such Interest Period. Such interest shall be
payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest
Period is longer than 3 months, at intervals of 3 months after the first day
thereof. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest on any Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan shall bear interest, payable on
demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

"Adjusted IBOR Rate" means, with respect to each Interest
Period for a Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan, the sum (without duplication) of
(i) the rate obtained by dividing (A) IBOR for such Interest Period by (B) a
percentage equal to 1 minus the then stated maximum rate (stated as a decimal)
of all reserve requirements in respect of any category of liabilities by
reference to which the interest rate on such Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan is
determined (including, without limitation, any marginal, emergency,
supplemental, special or other reserves) applicable to any member bank of the
Federal Reserve System as defined in Regulation D (or against any successor
category of liabilities as defined in Regulation D), plus (ii) if the relevant
Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan is in Sterling, a percentage sufficient to
compensate the Banks for the cost of complying with any reserves, liquidity

<PAGE>


and/or special deposit requirements of the Bank of England directly or
indirectly affecting the maintenance or funding of such Syndicated Foreign
Currency Loan.

"IBOR" means, for any Interest Period, with respect to
Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, the offered rate for deposits in the
applicable Foreign Currency, for a period comparable to the Interest Period and
in an amount comparable to the amount of such Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan
appearing on the applicable Telerate Page as of 11:00 A.M. (London, England
time) on the day that is two Business Days prior to the first day of the
Interest Period. If the foregoing rate is unavailable from Telerate for any
reason, then such rate shall be determined by the Agent from any other interest
rate reporting service of recognized standing designated in writing by the Agent
to the Parent and the Banks.

(e) Each Money Market Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Money Market Rate for such Loan quoted
by the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Such interest
shall be payable for such Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such
Interest Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals of 90 days after the first
day thereof. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by law,
overdue interest on any Money Market Loan shall bear interest, payable on
demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

(f) The Agent shall determine in accordance with this
Agreement each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder. The Agent shall
give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Banks by telecopy of each rate of
interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

(g) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, the principal amount of the Loans (and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, all accrued interest thereon) may, at the election
of the Required Banks, bear interest at the Default Rate.

SECTION 2.07. Fees.

(a) The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the ratable
account of each Bank a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") on the maximum amount
of the aggregate Commitments in effect for any relevant period, irrespective of
usage, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate.
"Applicable Facility Fee Rate" means (i) for the period commencing on the
Closing Date to and including the first Performance Pricing Determination Date,
0.225%; and (ii) from and after the first Performance Pricing Determination
Date, the percentage determined on each Performance Pricing Determination Date
by reference to the table set forth below, based upon the ratio of Consolidated
Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (calculated as of the last day of each Fiscal
Quarter) or, but only if the Parent has Rated Debt outstanding, the Debt Rating:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S>                      <C>                <C>                         <C>                        <C>

Facility Fee Rate

</TABLE>

<PAGE>


provided, that if on any Performance Pricing Determination Date on which the
Parent has Rated Debt outstanding (i) application of the Consolidated Debt to
Consolidated EBITDA ratio test only would result in a lower Applicable Facility
Fee Rate than application of the Debt Rating test only, the Applicable Facility
Fee Rate shall be determined based upon the Level next lower than the Level
determined based upon the Debt Rating test only, and (ii) if the Debt Rating
received from any of (A) Duff & Phelps is "BB" or lower, (B) Fitch is "B" or
lower, (C) Moody's is "Ba2" or lower, and (D) S&P is "BB" or lower, then the
Applicable Facility Fee Rate shall be .325%. The Facility Fee shall accrue at
all times from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the Termination
Date and shall be payable, in arrears, on each Facility Fee Payment Date and on
the Termination Date.

(b) In determining the Applicable Margin and the Applicable
Facility Fee Rate, the Agent and the Banks shall refer to the most recent
financial statements of the Parent and its Consolidated Subsidiaries delivered
to the Banks pursuant to Section 5.01(a) (together with the Compliance
Certificate delivered in connection therewith, the "Audited Statements") and
Section 5.01(b) (together with the Compliance Certificate delivered in
connection therewith, the "Unaudited Statements") and, if the Parent has Rated
Debt outstanding, the Debt Ratings in effect from time to time. For purposes
hereof, "Performance Pricing Determination Date" shall mean (i) each date that
occurs 45 days after the end of each of the first 3 Fiscal Quarters, and 90 days
after the end of the last Fiscal Quarter, or, if applicable, (ii) each date on
which the Debt Rating changes. Each change in interest and fees as a result of a
change in Debt Rating or as a result of a change in the ratio of Consolidated
Debt to Consolidated EBITDA as reflected in the Audited Statements or the
Unaudited Statements shall be effective only for Syndicated Loans (including
Refunding Loans) which are made on or after the relevant Performance Pricing
Determination Date. All determinations hereunder shall be made by the Agent
unless the Required Banks shall object to any such determination. The Parent
shall promptly notify the Agent of any change in the Debt Rating.

SECTION 2.08. Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The
Parent may, upon at least 3 Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent,
terminate at any time, or proportionately permanently reduce from time to time
by an aggregate amount of at least $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of
$1,000,000, the Commitments; provided, however, no such termination or reduction
shall be in an amount greater than the Total Unused Commitments on the date of
such termination or reduction. If the Commitments are terminated in their
entirety, all accrued fees (as provided under Section 2.07) shall be payable on
the effective date of such termination.

SECTION 2.09. Mandatory Termination of Commitments. The Commitments
shall terminate on the Termination Date and any Loans then outstanding (together
with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.

SECTION 2.10. Optional Prepayments.

(a) The Borrower may, upon at least 1 Domestic Business Day's
notice to the Agent, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing made by such Borrower in
whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating at least
$1,000,000, or any larger multiple of $500,000, by paying the principal amount
to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment.
Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Base Rate
Loans of the several Banks included in such Base Rate Borrowing.

<PAGE>


(b) The Borrower may prepay in minimum amount of $1,000,000
(or any larger multiple of $500,000, or any lesser amounts equal to the
outstanding balance of such Loan) all or any portion of the principal amount of
any Fixed Rate Loan or any Money Market Loan on the last day of any Interest
Period applicable to such Fixed Rate Loan or Money Market Loan and, subject to
any payment required pursuant to Section 8.05 and upon 3 Domestic Business Days'
prior written notice, on any other day prior to the last day of any such
Interest Period.

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this
Section, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and
of such Bank's ratable share of such prepayment and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.11. Mandatory Prepayments.

(a) On each date on which the Commitments are reduced or
terminated pursuant to Section 2.08 or Section 2.09, the Borrower shall repay or
prepay such principal amount of the outstanding Loans, if any (together with
interest accrued thereon and any amounts due under Section 8.05(a)), as may be
necessary so that after such payment the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
the Loans does not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments as then
reduced. Each such payment or prepayment shall be applied to repay or prepay
ratably the Loans of the several Banks; provided that such prepayment shall be
applied, first, to Syndicated Loans outstanding on the date of such prepayment
(in direct order of maturity) and then, to the extent necessary, to Money Market
Loans outstanding on the date of such prepayment (in direct order of maturity).

(b) If the Agent determines at any time (either on its own
initiative or at the instance of any Bank) that the aggregate principal amount
of the Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans outstanding (after converting each such
Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan to its Dollar Equivalent on the date of
calculation) at any time exceeds the aggregate Commitments less the outstanding
aggregate amount of all Syndicated Dollar Loans and all Money Market Loans, then
upon 5 Foreign Currency Business Days' written notice from the Agent, the Parent
shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Loans sufficient to bring the
aggregate of the Dollar Equivalent of the Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, the
Syndicated Dollar Loans and the Money Market Loans outstanding to an amount not
exceeding the aggregate Commitments. Nothing in the foregoing shall require the
Agent to make any such calculation unless expressly requested to do so by the
Required Banks. All such prepayments shall be applied in the following order:
(i) first to Base Rate Loan; (ii) then to Euro-Dollar Loans; and (iii) then, to
Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, and (iv) lastly, to Money Market Loans.

SECTION 2.12. General Provisions as to Payments.

(a) The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and
interest on, the Loans and of facility fees hereunder, not later than 1:00 P.M.
(Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date when due, in Federal or other funds (subject
to paragraph (c) of this Section with respect to Syndicated Foreign Currency
Loans) immediately available in Atlanta, Georgia, to the Agent at its address
referred to in Section 9.01. The Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its
ratable share of each such payment received by the Agent for the account of the
Banks.

(b) Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Base Rate Loans or the Money Market Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which
is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended
to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal
of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans or Foreign Currency Loans shall be due
on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day or a Foreign Currency Business
Day, as the case may be, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day or Foreign Currency Business Day, as
the case may be, unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day or Foreign Currency
Business Day, as the case may be, falls in another calendar month, in which case
the date for

<PAGE>


payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day or Foreign
Currency Business Day, as the case may be. If the date for any payment of
principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall
be payable for such extended time.

(c) All payments of principal and interest with respect to
Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans shall be made in the Foreign Currency in which
the related Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan was made.

(d) All payments of principal, interest and fees and all other
amounts to be made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
any Loan or fee relating thereto shall be paid without deduction for, and free
from, any tax, imposts, levies, duties, deductions, or withholdings of any
nature now or at anytime hereafter imposed by any governmental authority or by
any taxing authority thereof or therein excluding in the case of each Bank,
taxes imposed on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on
it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank is organized or any
political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on
its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such
Bank's applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, imposts, levies, duties, deductions or withholdings of any
nature being "Taxes"). In the event that the Borrower is required by applicable
law to make any such withholding or deduction of Taxes with respect to any Loan
or fee or other amount, such Borrower shall pay such deduction or withholding to
the applicable taxing authority, shall promptly furnish to any Bank in respect
of which such deduction or withholding is made all receipts and other documents
evidencing such payment and shall pay to such Bank additional amounts as may be
necessary in order that the amount received by such Bank after the required
withholding, deduction or other payment (including any withholding, deduction or
other payment in respect of additional sums payable under this Section 2.12(d))
shall equal the amount such Bank would have received had no such withholding or
other payment been made. If no withholding or deduction of Taxes are payable in
respect of any Loan or fee relating thereto, such Borrower shall furnish any
Bank, at such Bank's request, a certificate from each applicable taxing
authority or an opinion of counsel acceptable to such Bank, in either case
stating that such payments are exempt from or not subject to withholding or
deduction of Taxes. If the Borrower fails to provide such original or certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment of Taxes or certificate(s) or opinion of
counsel of exemption, such Borrower hereby agrees to compensate such Bank for,
and indemnify them with respect to, the tax consequences of such Borrower's
failure to provide evidence of tax payments or tax exemption.

Each Bank which is not organized under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof agrees, as soon as practicable after
request by it of a request by the Borrower to do so, to file all appropriate
forms and take other appropriate action to obtain a certificate or other
appropriate document from the appropriate governmental authority in the
jurisdiction imposing the relevant taxes, establishing that it is entitled to
receive payments of principal and interest under this Agreement and the Notes
without deduction and free from withholding of any Taxes imposed by such
jurisdiction; provided, that, if it is unable, for any reason, to establish such
exemption, or to file such forms and, in any event, during such period of time
as such request for exemption is pending, such Borrower shall nonetheless remain
obligated under the terms of the immediately preceding paragraph.

Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained
in this Section 2.12 shall be applicable with respect to any Participant,
Assignee or other Transferee, and any calculations required by such provisions
(i) shall be made based upon the circumstances of such Participant, Assignee or
other Transferee, and (ii) constitute a continuing agreement and shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the payment in full or cancellation of the
Notes.

SECTION 2.13. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest on Base Rate
Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case
may be, and paid for the actual number of

<PAGE>


days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Interest on
Euro-Dollar Loans, Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans and Money Market Loans
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days (except for any Syndicated
Foreign Currency Loans outstanding in Sterling or Canadian Dollars, which shall
be computed on the basis of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be) and paid for
the actual number of days elapsed, calculated as to each Interest Period from
and including the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof.
Facility fees and any other fees payable hereunder shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

SECTION 2.14. Termination of Existing Credit Agreement. The Borrower,
the Agent and the Banks hereby agree that upon satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Section 3.01 the Existing Credit Agreement shall terminate and all
Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) outstanding under the
Existing Credit Agreement (the "Outstanding Loans") upon such termination shall
be deemed to be paid in full with the proceeds of new Syndicated Foreign
Currency Loans made under this Agreement (without the need for the delivery of a
Notice of Borrowing) in Foreign Currencies and such principal amounts, bearing
interest at the rates and with Interest Periods applicable thereto identical to
the Foreign Currencies, principal amounts, interest rates and Interest Periods
applicable to the Outstanding Loans immediately prior to the termination of the
Existing Credit Agreement in accordance with this Section. Furthermore, all
accrued and unpaid obligations of the Borrower under the Existing Credit

(or, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would enable) the

the maturity thereof or require the mandatory prepayment or purchase thereof
prior to the scheduled maturity thereof, without regard to whether such holders
or other Person shall have exercised or waived their right to do so; or

(g) the Parent or any Subsidiary shall commence a voluntary
case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief
with respect to itself or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other

days, or such longer period during which execution of such judgment shall have
been stayed, appeal therefrom and cause the execution thereof to be stayed
during such appeal; or

(k) a federal tax lien shall be filed against the Parent or
any Subsidiary under Section 6323 of the Code or a lien of the PBGC shall be

ARTICLE VII

THE AGENT

SECTION 7.01. Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Bank hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as its agent hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to
the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent: (a) shall have no duties or
responsibilities except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document be a trustee for any Bank; (b) shall not be responsible to the Banks
for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by any Bank under, this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, or for the validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any
failure by the Borrower to perform any of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or
collection proceedings hereunder or under any other Loan Document except to the
extent requested by the Required Banks, and then only on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Agent, and (d) shall not be responsible for any action taken
or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any
other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein or in
connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. The provisions of this
Article VII are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks, and the
Borrower shall not have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the
provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement
and under the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall act solely as agent of the
Banks and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation
towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Borrower. The duties
of the Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in nature, and the Agent
shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Bank.

SECTION 7.02. Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any thereof by
telephone, telefax, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants or
other experts selected by the Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided
for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
thereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the Required Banks, and
such instructions of the Required Banks in any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks.

SECTION 7.03. Defaults. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default (other than the
non-payment of principal of or interest on the Loans or non-payment of the
facility fee) unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank or the Borrower
specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"Notice of Default". In the

<PAGE>


event that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. The
Agent shall give each Bank prompt notice of each non-payment of principal of or
interest on the Loans or of the facility fee, whether or not it has received any
notice of the occurrence of such non-payment. The Agent shall (subject to
Section 9.05) take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default
as shall be directed by the Required Banks, provided that, unless and until the
Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Banks.

SECTION 7.04. Rights of Agent and its Affiliates as a Bank. With
respect to any Loan made by Wachovia or an Affiliate of Wachovia, such Affiliate
and Wachovia in their capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have the same rights
and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it
were not an Affiliate of Wachovia (or in Wachovia's case, acting as the Agent),
and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates,
include such Affiliate of Wachovia or Wachovia in its individual capacity. Such
Affiliate and Wachovia may (without having to account therefor to any Bank)
accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking,
trust or other business with the Borrower (and any Affiliate of the Borrower) as
if they were not an Affiliate of the Agent or the Agent, respectively; and such
Affiliate and Wachovia may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower
(in addition to any agency fees and arrangement fees heretofore agreed to
between the Parent and Wachovia) for services in connection with this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or otherwise without having to account for the same
to the Banks.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. Each Bank severally agrees to indemnify
the Agent, to the extent the Agent shall not have been reimbursed by the
Borrower, ratably in accordance with its Commitment, for any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees and disbursements)
or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other documents contemplated
by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (excluding, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of its
agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
thereof or any such other documents; provided, however, that no Bank shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent. If any indemnity furnished to the
Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the Agent, be insufficient or
become impaired, the Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not
commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is
furnished.

SECTION 7.06. CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. THE AGENT SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE
OR LIABLE TO ANY BANK, THE BORROWER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY
PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE ALLEGED AS A RESULT OF
THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

SECTION 7.07. Payee of Note Treated as Owner. The Agent may deem and
treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless
and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been
filed with the Agent and the provisions of Section 9.07(c) have been satisfied.
Any requests, authority or consent of any Person who at the time of making such
request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any Note shall be
conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of that
Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor or replacement thereof.

SECTION 7.08. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank agrees
that it has, independently and without reliance on the Agent or any other Bank,
and based on such documents and

<PAGE>


information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the
Borrower and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. The Agent shall not be
required to keep itself (or any Bank) informed as to the performance or
observance by the Borrower of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to
inspect the properties or books of the Borrower or any other Person. Except for
notices, reports and other documents and information expressly required to be
furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents,
the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any
credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or
business of the Borrower or any other Person (or any of their Affiliates) which
may come into the possession of the Agent.

SECTION 7.09. Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of
the Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall in all
cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder and thereunder
unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction by the Banks of
their indemnification obligations under Section 7.05 against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by the Agent by reason of taking,
continuing to take, or failing to take any such action.

SECTION 7.10. Resignation or Removal of Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent may
resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Parent and the
Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Banks.
Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after
the retiring Agent's notice of resignation or the Required Banks' removal of the
retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a
successor Agent. Any successor Agent shall be a bank which has a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder.

ARTICLE VIII

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES; COMPENSATION

SECTION 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair.
If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period:

(a) the Agent determines that deposits in Dollars or the
relevant Foreign Currency (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in
the relevant market for such Interest Period, or

(b) the Required Banks advise the Agent that the London
Interbank Offered Rate or IBOR, as the case may be, as reasonably determined by
the Agent, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of
funding the relevant type of Fixed Rate Loans for such Interest Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Parent and the Banks,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Parent that the circumstances giving rise
to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make the
type of Fixed Rate Loans specified in such notice shall be suspended. Unless the
Borrower notifies the Agent at least 2 Domestic Business Days before the date of
any Borrowing of such type of Fixed Rate Loans for which a Notice of Borrowing
has previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such
Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.

<PAGE>


SECTION 8.02. Illegality. If, after the date hereof, the adoption of
any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any existing or future
law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof (any such authority, bank or
agency being referred to as an "Authority" and any such event being referred to
as a "Change of Law"), or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending Office) with
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any
Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its Lending
Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans or Syndicated Foreign
Currency Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall
forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Parent, whereupon until
such Bank notifies the Parent and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise
to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make
Euro-Dollar Loans or Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, as the case may be,
shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this
Section, such Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such
designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank
shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of
its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans or Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, as the
case may be, to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall
immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each
Euro-Dollar Loan or Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan, as the case may be, of
such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon and any amount due such Bank
pursuant to Section 8.05(a). Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar
Loan or Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan, as the case may be, the Borrower shall
borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on which
interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related
Euro-Dollar Loans or Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, as the case may be, of
the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.

SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return.

(a) If after the date hereof, a Change of Law or compliance by
any Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any Authority:

(i) shall subject any Bank (or its Lending Office) to
any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Fixed Rate
Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans,
or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank
(or its Lending Office) of the principal of or interest on its
Fixed Rate Loans or any other amounts due under this Agreement
in respect of its Fixed Rate Loans or its obligation to make
Fixed Rate Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the
overall net income of such Bank or its Lending Office imposed
by the jurisdiction in which such Bank's principal executive
office or Lending Office is located); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including,
without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding (A)
with respect to any Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan any such
requirement included in an applicable Adjusted IBOR Rate and
(B) with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement
included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage)
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
credit extended by, any Bank (or its Lending Office); or

(iii) shall impose on any Bank (or its Lending
Office) or on the London or other relevant interbank market
any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, its Notes
or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans;

<PAGE>


and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or
its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending
Office) under this Agreement or under its Notes with respect thereto, by an
amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by
such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased
cost or reduction.

(b) If any Bank shall have determined that after the date
hereof the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital
adequacy, or any change in any existing or future law, rule or regulation, or
any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any Authority, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank
could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Bank's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15
days after demand by such Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.

(c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Parent and the Agent of
any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a
different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce
the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank claiming
compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or
amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

(d) The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall be applicable
with respect to any Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and any
calculations required by such provisions shall be made based upon the
circumstances of such Participant, Assignee or other Transferee and shall
constitute a continuing agreement and shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment in full or cancellation of the Notes.

SECTION 8.04. Base Rate Loans or Other Fixed Rate Loans Substituted for
Affected Fixed Rate Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain
Euro-Dollar Loans or Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans has been suspended
pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under
Section 8.03, and the Parent shall, by at least 5 Euro-Dollar Business Days'
prior notice to such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the provisions of
this Section shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies
the Parent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for
compensation no longer apply:

(a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as
Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be,
shall be made instead either (A) as Base Rate Loans, (B) if such suspension or
demand for compensation relates to Euro-Dollar Loans, but not Syndicated Foreign
Currency Loans, as Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, or (C) if such demand for
compensation relates to Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans, but not Euro-Dollar
Loans, as Euro-Dollar Loans, as the Parent may elect in the notice to such Bank
through the Agent referred to hereinabove (in all cases interest and principal
on such Loans shall be payable contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate
Loans of the other Banks), and

(b) after each of its Syndicated Foreign Currency Loans or
Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, has been repaid, all payments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall
be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

<PAGE>


In the event that the Parent shall elect that the provisions of this Section
shall apply to any Bank, the Borrower shall remain liable for, and shall pay to
such Bank as provided herein, all amounts due such Bank under Section 8.03 in
respect of the period preceding the date of conversion of such Bank's Loans
resulting from the Parent's election.

SECTION 8.05. Compensation. Upon the request of any Bank, delivered to
the Parent and the Agent, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such amount or
amounts as shall compensate such Bank for any loss, cost or expense incurred by
such Bank as a result of:

(a) any payment or prepayment (pursuant to Section 2.10,
Section 2.11, Section 6.01, Section 8.02 or otherwise) of a Fixed Rate Loan or a
Money Market Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for
such Fixed Rate Loan or Money Market Loan, as the case may be;

(b) any failure by the Borrower to prepay a Fixed Rate Loan or
a Money Market Loan on the date for such prepayment specified in the relevant
notice of prepayment hereunder;

(c) any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Fixed Rate Loan on
the date for the Fixed Rate Borrowing of which such Fixed Rate Loan is a part
specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing delivered pursuant to Section
2.02;

(d) any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Money Market Loan
(with respect to which such Borrower has accepted a Money Market Quote) on the
date for the Money Market Borrowing of which such Money Market Loan is a part
specified in the applicable Money Market Quote Request delivered pursuant to
Section 2.03; or

(e) any failure by the Borrower to pay a Syndicated Foreign
Currency Loan in the applicable Foreign Currency;

such compensation to include, without limitation, as applicable: (A) an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so paid or prepaid or not prepaid or borrowed for the
period from the date of such payment, prepayment or failure to prepay or borrow
to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Fixed Rate Loan
(or, in the case of a failure to prepay or borrow, the Interest Period for such
Fixed Rate Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to prepay
or borrow) at the applicable rate of interest for such Fixed Rate Loan provided
for herein over (y) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such
Bank) such Bank would have paid on (i) deposits in Dollars of comparable amounts
having terms comparable to such period placed with it by leading banks in the
London interbank market (if such Fixed Rate Loan is a Euro-Dollar Loan), or (ii)
any deposit in a Foreign Currency of comparable amounts having terms comparable
to such period placed with it by lending banks in the applicable interbank
market for such Foreign Currency (if such Fixed Rate Loan is a Syndicated
Foreign Currency Loan) or (B) any such loss, cost or expense incurred by such
Bank in liquidating or closing out any foreign currency contract undertaken by
such Bank in funding or maintaining such Fixed Rate Loan (if such Fixed Rate
Loan is a Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan).

SECTION 8.06. Failure to Pay in Foreign Currency. If the Borrower is
unable for any reason to effect payment in a Foreign Currency as required by
this Agreement or if the Borrower shall default in a Foreign Currency, each Bank
may, through the Agent, require such payment to be made in Dollars in the Dollar
Equivalent amount of such payment. In any case in which the Borrower shall make
such payment in Dollars, such Borrower agrees to hold the Banks harmless from
any loss incurred by the Banks arising from any change in the value of Dollars
in relation to such Foreign Currency between the date such payment became due
and the date of payment thereof.

SECTION 8.07. Judgment Currency. If for the purpose of obtaining
judgment in any court or

<PAGE>


enforcing any such judgment it is necessary to convert any amount due in any
Foreign Currency into any other currency, the rate of exchange used shall be the
Agent's spot rate of exchange for the purchase of the Foreign Currency with such
other currency at the close of business on the Foreign Currency Business Day
preceding the date on which judgment is given or any order for payment is made.
The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any amount due from it hereunder
shall, notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum or sums in
respect of amounts due hereunder or under any judgment or order in any other
currency or otherwise be discharged only to the extent that on the Foreign
Currency Business Day following receipt by the Agent of any payment in a
currency other than the relevant Foreign Currency the Agent is able (in
accordance with normal banking procedures) to purchase the relevant Foreign
Currency with such other currency. If the amount of the relevant Foreign
Currency that the Agent is able to purchase with such other currency is less
than the amount due in the relevant Foreign Currency, notwithstanding any
judgment or order, such Borrower shall indemnify the Banks for the shortfall.

(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent, the Banks and each
Affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
from, and hold each of them harmless against,

<PAGE>


any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them may
become subject, insofar as such losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise out
of or result from any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of
any extension of credit by any Bank hereunder or breach by the Borrower of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or from investigation, litigation
(including, without limitation, any actions taken by the Agent or any of the
Banks to enforce this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents) or other
proceeding (including, without limitation, any threatened investigation or
proceeding) relating to the foregoing, and the Borrower shall reimburse the
Agent and each Bank, and each Affiliate thereof and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents, upon demand for any expenses (including, without
limitation, legal fees) incurred in connection with any such investigation or
proceeding; but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Person to be indemnified.

SECTION 9.04. Setoffs; Sharing of Set-Offs.

(a) The Borrower hereby grants to each Bank, as security for
the full and punctual payment and performance of the obligations of such
Borrower under this Agreement, a continuing lien on and security interest in all
deposits and other sums credited by or due from such Bank to such Borrower or
subject to withdrawal by such Borrower; and regardless of the adequacy of any
collateral or other means of obtaining repayment of such obligations, each Bank
may at any time upon or after the occurrence of any Event of Default, and
without notice to the Borrower, set off the whole or any portion or portions of
any or all such deposits and other sums against such obligations, whether or not
any other Person or Persons could also withdraw money therefrom.

(b) Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right
of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the
aggregate amount of principal and interest owing with respect to the Syndicated
Notes held by it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank
in respect of the aggregate amount of all principal and interest owing with
respect to the Syndicated Notes held by such other Bank, the Bank receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the
Syndicated Notes held by the other Banks owing to such other Banks, and/or such
other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of
principal and interest with respect to the Syndicated Notes held by the Banks
owing to such other Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that
(i) nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any
right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to
such exercise to the payment of indebtedness (including, without limitation,
Money Market Loans) of the Borrower other than its indebtedness under the
Syndicated Notes, and (ii) if all or any portion of such payment received by the
purchasing Bank is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase
from each other Bank shall be rescinded and such other Bank shall repay to the
purchasing Bank the purchase price of such participation to the extent of such
recovery together with an amount equal to such other Bank's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (x) the amount of such other Bank's required
repayment to (y) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of
the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a
Syndicated Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements,
may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to
such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct
creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 9.05. Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement, the Notes or any other
Loan Documents may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or
waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and,
if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the Agent);
provided that no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks,
(i) change the Commitment of any Bank or subject any Bank to any additional
obligation, (ii) change the principal of or

<PAGE>


reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or reduce any fees hereunder, (iii)
change the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or
any fees hereunder, (iv) change the amount of principal or reduce the rate or
amount of interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment thereof, (v)
change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of the Notes, or the percentage of Banks, which shall be required for the
Banks or any of them to take any action under this Section or any other
provision of this Agreement, (vi) change the manner of application of any
payments made under this Agreement or the Notes, or (vii) release any guaranty
given to support payment of the Loans.

(b) The Borrower will not solicit, request or negotiate for or
with respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of any of the provisions of
this Agreement unless each Bank shall be informed thereof by the Borrower and
shall be afforded an opportunity of considering the same and shall be supplied
by the Borrower with sufficient information to enable it to make an informed
decision with respect thereto. Executed or true and correct copies of any waiver
or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall be
delivered by the Borrower to each Bank forthwith following the date on which the
same shall have been executed and delivered by the requisite percentage of
Banks. The Borrower will not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid
any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or
otherwise, to any Bank (in its capacity as such) as consideration for or as an
inducement to the entering into by such Bank of any waiver or amendment of any
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement unless such remuneration is
concurrently paid, on the same terms, ratably to all such Banks.

SECTION 9.06. Margin Stock Collateral. Each of the Banks represents to
the Agent and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not, directly or
indirectly (by negative pledge or otherwise), relying upon any Margin Stock as
collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.07. Successors and Assigns.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns; provided that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of
its rights under this Agreement.

(b) Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more Persons (each
a "Participant") participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any
Note held by such Bank, any Commitment hereunder or any other interest of such
Bank hereunder. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of a participating
interest to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance
thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes
under this Agreement, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. In no event shall a Bank that sells a
participation be obligated to the Participant to take or refrain from taking any
action hereunder except that such Bank may agree that it will not (except as
provided below), without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i) the change
of any date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the related
Loan or Loans, (ii) the change of the amount of any principal or reduction of
the rate or amount of any interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment
thereof with respect to the related Loan or Loans, (iii) the change of the
principal of the related Loan or Loans, (iv) any reduction of the rate at which
either interest is payable thereon or (if the Participant is entitled to any
part thereof) facility fee is payable hereunder from the rate at which the
Participant is entitled to receive interest or facility fee (as the case may be)
in respect of such participation, or (v) the release of any guaranty given to
support payment of the Loans. Each Bank selling a participating interest in any
Loan having a term in excess of 1 year, Note, Commitment or other interest under
this Agreement shall, within 10 Domestic Business Days of such sale, provide the
Parent and the Agent with written notification stating that such sale has
occurred and identifying the Participant and the

<PAGE>


interest purchased by such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to
its participation in Loans outstanding from time to time.

(c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or
financial institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part of all,
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan
Documents, and such Assignee shall assume all such rights and obligations,
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
K, executed by such Assignee, such transferor Bank and the Agent (and, in the
case of: (i) an Assignee that is not then a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank; and
(ii) an assignment not made during the existence of a Default or an Event of
Default, by the Parent); provided that (i) no interest may be sold by a Bank
pursuant to this paragraph (c) unless the Assignee shall agree to assume ratably
equivalent portions of the transferor Bank's Commitment, (ii) the amount of the
Commitment of the assigning Bank being assigned pursuant to such assignment
(determined as of the effective date of the assignment) shall be equal to or
greater than $10,000,000, (iii) no interest may be sold by a Bank pursuant to
this paragraph (c) to any Assignee that is not then a Bank or an Affiliate of a
Bank without the consent of the Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, provided that the Parent's consent shall not be necessary with respect
to any assignment made during the existence of a Default or an Event of Default;
(iv) a Bank may not have more than 2 Assignees that are not then Banks, and (v)
no interest may be sold by a Bank pursuant to this paragraph (c) to any Assignee
that is not then a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank, without the consent of the
Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided, that although
the Agent's consent may not be necessary with respect to an Assignee that is
then a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank, no such assignment shall be effective
until the conditions set forth in the following sentence are satisfied. Upon (A)
execution of the Assignment and Acceptance by such transferor Bank, such
Assignee, the Agent and (if applicable) the Parent, (B) delivery of an executed
copy of the Assignment and Acceptance to the Parent and the Agent, (C) payment
by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase
price agreed between such transferor Bank and such Assignee, and (D) payment by
the assigning Bank of a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 to the Agent,
such Assignee shall for all purposes be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall
have all the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the rights of a Bank under Section 2.03) to the same extent
as if it were an original party hereto with a Commitment as set forth in such
instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or
action by the Borrower, the Banks or the Agent shall be required. Upon the
consummation of any transfer to an Assignee pursuant to this paragraph (c), the
transferor Bank, the Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements
so that, if required, new Notes are issued to each of such Assignee and such
transferor Bank.

(d) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.08, the Borrower
authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant, Assignee or other
transferee (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all
financial and other information in such Bank's possession concerning the
Borrower which has been delivered to such Bank by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or which has been delivered to such Bank by the Borrower in connection
with such Bank's credit evaluation prior to entering into this Agreement.

(e) No Transferee shall be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 8.03 than the transferor Bank would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made
with the Parent's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions of
Section 8.02 or 8.03 requiring such Bank to designate a different Lending Office
under certain circumstances or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to
such greater payment did not exist.

(f) Anything in this Section 9.07 to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Bank may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Loans
and/or obligations owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States
Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Operating Circular issued by such
Federal Reserve Bank, provided that

<PAGE>


any payment in respect of such assigned Loans and/or obligations made by the
Borrower to the assigning and/or pledging Bank in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall satisfy such Borrower's obligations hereunder in respect of
such assigned Loans and/or obligations to the extent of such payment. No such
assignment shall release the assigning and/or pledging Bank from its obligations
hereunder.

SECTION 9.08. Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees to exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to keep any information delivered or made
available by the Parent to it which is clearly indicated to be confidential
information, confidential from anyone other than persons employed or retained by
such Bank or an Affiliate of such Bank who are or are expected to become engaged
in evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the Loans; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall prevent any Bank from disclosing such
information (i) to any other Bank, (ii) upon the order of any court or
administrative agency or pursuant to subpoena or other court process, (iii) upon
the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction
over such Bank, (iv) which has been publicly disclosed, (v) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which the Agent, any
Bank or their respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder,
(vii) to such Bank's legal counsel and independent auditors and (viii) to any
actual or proposed Participant, Assignee or other Transferee of all or part of
its rights hereunder which has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions
of this Section 9.08.

SECTION 9.09. Representation by Banks. Each Bank hereby represents that
it is a commercial lender or financial institution which makes loans in the
ordinary course of its business and that it will make its Loans hereunder for
its own account in the ordinary course of such business; provided, however,
that, subject to Section 9.07, the disposition of the Note or Notes held by that
Bank shall at all times be within its exclusive control.

SECTION 9.10. Obligations Several. The obligations of each Bank
hereunder are several, and no Bank shall be responsible for the obligations or
commitment of any other Bank hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement and
no action taken by the Banks pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the
Banks to be a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of
entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Bank shall be a
separate and independent debt, and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and
enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
it shall not be necessary for any other Bank to be joined as an additional party
in any proceeding for such purpose.

SECTION 9.11. Survival of Certain Obligations. Sections 8.03(a),
8.03(b), 8.05 and 9.03, and the obligations of the Borrower thereunder, shall
survive, and shall continue to be enforceable notwithstanding, the termination
of this Agreement and the Commitments and the payment in full of the principal
of and interest on all Loans.

SECTION 9.12. Georgia Law. This Agreement and each Note shall be
construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of Georgia.

SECTION 9.13. Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents should
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall be enforced to the
greatest extent permitted by law.

SECTION 9.14. Interest. In no event shall the amount of interest due or
payable hereunder or under the Notes exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed
by applicable law, and in the event any such payment is inadvertently made to
any Bank by the Borrower or inadvertently received by any Bank, then such excess
sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless such Borrower shall
notify such Bank

<PAGE>


in writing that it elects to have such excess sum returned forthwith. It is the
express intent hereof that the Borrower shall not pay nor any Bank receive,
directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that
which may legally be paid by such Borrower under applicable law.

SECTION 9.15. Interpretation. No provision of this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents shall be construed against or interpreted to the
disadvantage of any party hereto by any court or other governmental or judicial
authority by reason of such party having or being deemed to have structured or
dictated such provision.

SECTION 9.16. Consent to Jurisdiction. The Borrower (a) submits to
personal jurisdiction in the State of Georgia, the courts thereof and the United
States District Courts sitting therein, for the enforcement of this Agreement,
the Notes and the other Loan Documents, (b) waives any and all personal rights
under the law of any jurisdiction to object on any basis (including, without
limitation, inconvenience of forum) to jurisdiction or venue within the State of
Georgia for the purpose of litigation to enforce this Agreement, the Notes or
the other Loan Documents, and (c) agrees that service of process may be made
upon it in the manner prescribed in Section 9.01 for the giving of notice to the
Borrower. Nothing herein contained, however, shall prevent the Agent from
bringing any action or exercising any rights against any security and against
the Borrower personally, and against any assets of the Borrower, within any
other state or jurisdiction.

SECTION 9.17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

SECTION 9.18. European Economic and Monetary Union.

(a) In this Section 9.18 and in each other provision of this
Agreement to which reference is made in this Section 9.18 expressly or
impliedly, the following terms have the meanings given to them in this Section
9.18.

"commencement of the third stage of EMU" means the date of
commencement of the third stage of EMU (January 1, 1999) or the date on which
circumstances arise which (in the opinion of the Agent) have substantially the
same effect and result in substantially the same consequences as commencement of
the third stage of EMU as contemplated by the Treaty on European Union.

"EMU" means economic and monetary union as contemplated in the
Treaty on European Union.

"EMU legislation" means legislative measures of the European
Council for the introduction of, changeover to or operation of a single or
unified European currency (whether known as the euro or otherwise), being in
part the implementation of the third stage of EMU.

"euro" means the single currency of participating member
states of the European Union.

"euro unit" means the currency unit of the euro.

"national currency unit" means the unit of currency (other
than a euro unit) of a participating member state.

"participating member state" means each state so described in
any EMU legislation.

"Treaty on European Union" means the Treaty of Rome of March
25, 1957, as amended by the Single European Act 1986 and the Maastricht Treaty
(which was signed at Maastricht on February 7, 1992, and came into force on
November 1, 1993), as amended from time to time.

<PAGE>


(b) The provisions of paragraphs (c) to (i) below (inclusive)
shall be effective at and from the commencement of the third stage of EMU,
provided, that if and to the extent that any such provision relates to any state
(or the currency of such state) that is not a participating member state on the
commencement of the third stage of EMU, such provision shall become effective in
relation to such state (and the currency of such state) at and from the date on
which such state becomes a participating member state.

(c) Each obligation under this Agreement of a party to this
Agreement which has been denominated in the national currency unit of a
participating member state shall be redenominated into the euro unit in
accordance with EMU legislation, provided, that if and to the extent that any
EMU legislation provides that following the commencement of the third stage of
EMU an amount denominated either in the euro or in the national currency unit of
a participating member state and payable within that participating member state
by crediting an account of the creditor can be paid by the debtor either in the
euro unit or in the national currency unit, each party to this Agreement shall
be entitled to pay or repay any such amount either in the euro unit or in such
national currency unit.

(d) Any Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan in the currency of a
participating member state shall be made in the euro unit.

(e) Sections 2.02(c) and 2.12(a) shall be construed so that,
in relation to the payment of any amount of euro units or national currency
units, such amount shall be made available to the Agent in immediately
available, freely transferable, cleared funds to such account with such bank in
London, England (or such other principal financial center in such participating
member state as the Agent may from time to time nominate for this purpose) as
the Agent shall from time to time nominate for this purpose.

(f) Any amount payable by the Agent to the Banks under this
Agreement in the currency of a participating member state shall be paid in the
euro unit.

(g) With respect to the payment of any amount denominated in
the euro or in a national currency unit, the Agent shall not be liable to the
Borrower or any of the Banks in any way whatsoever for any delay, or the
consequences of any delay, in the crediting to any account of any amount
required by this Agreement to be paid by the Agent if the Agent shall have taken
all relevant steps to achieve, on the date required by this Agreement, the
payment of such amount in immediately available, freely transferable, cleared
funds (in the euro unit or, as the case may be, in a national currency unit) to
the account with the bank in the principal financial center in the participating
member state which the Borrower or, as the case may be, any Bank shall have
specified for such purpose. In this paragraph (g), "all relevant steps" means
all such steps as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations or
operating procedures of such clearing or settlement system as the Agent may from
time to time determine for the purpose of clearing or settling payments of the
euro.

(h) If the basis of accrual of interest or fees expressed in
this Agreement with respect to the currency of any state that becomes a
participating state shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the
London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect
of the euro, such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis
effective as of and from the date on which such state becomes a participating
member state; provided, that if any Syndicated Foreign Currency Loan in the
currency of such state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such
replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Syndicated Foreign Currency
Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

<PAGE>


(i) Without prejudice and in addition to any method of
conversion or rounding prescribed by any EMU legislation and without prejudice
to the respective liabilities for indebtedness of the Borrower to the Banks and
the Banks to the Borrower under or pursuant to this Agreement:

(i) each reference in this Agreement to a minimum
amount (or an integral multiple thereof) in a national
currency unit to be paid to or by the Agent shall be replaced
by a reference to such reasonably comparable and convenient
amount (or an integral multiple thereof)in the euro unit as
the Agent may from time to time specify; and

(ii) except as expressly provided in this Section
9.18, each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to
such reasonable changes of construction as the Agent may from
time to time specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect
the introduction of or changeover to the euro in participating
member states.

time shall be deemed to have been received on the next Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder or under a Note is stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such
extension of time shall be included in computing any interest or fee then due. If a payment is 10 days or more late the Borrower shall pay to the Bank a late fee of 5.00% of the total payment due, up to the maximum amount of $1,500 per late fee;
provided that if the Borrower and the Bank have agreed that a payment due hereunder shall be made by automatic debit to one of the Borrower’s accounts with the Bank and a payment is late because of the failure to initiate such an
automatic debit entry (other than by Borrower’s instructions not to initiate such debit entry), the late payment described in this sentence shall automatically be waived.

(b) To effectuate any payment due under this Agreement, a Note or any other Loan Document, the Borrower hereby authorizes the Bank to
initiate debit entries to any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Bank and to debit the same to such account. This authorization to initiate debit entries shall remain in full force and effect until the Bank has received written
notification of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it. The Borrower acknowledges that (i) such debit entries may cause an overdraft of any such account which may result in
the Bank’s refusal to honor items drawn on any such account until adequate deposits are made to any such account; (ii) the Bank is under no duty or obligation to initiate any debit entry for any purpose; and (iii) if a debit is not
made because any such account does not have a sufficient available balance, or otherwise, the payment may be late or past due.

prepayment of the Note not later than 10:00 a.m. Milwaukee time on the prepayment date, specifying the prepayment date and the amount to be prepaid. Each optional prepayment of the Note shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000 (or if less, the unpaid
principal balance of a Note). The amount of such prepayment shall become due and payable by 12:00 p.m. Milwaukee time on the specified prepayment date. All optional prepayments of the Note shall be applied first, to any fees the Borrower then
owes the Bank hereunder, second, to any accrued and unpaid interest on the Loan, third, to the unpaid principal balance of the Notes in inverse order of maturity and fourth, to any other Obligations.

2.6 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Loan:

(a) the Bank determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Daily Borrowing LIBOR Rate; or
(b) the Daily Borrowing LIBOR Rate will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to the Bank of making or maintaining the DBLR Loan;


16










then the Bank shall give notice thereof to the Borrower by telephone or telecopy (confirmed in writing) as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Bank notifies the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (the Bank hereby agrees to promptly notify the Borrower at such time as such circumstances no longer exist), (i) all Loans shall automatically be converted to Prime Rate Loans and
(ii) any new Loans shall be made as Prime Rate Loans. The unpaid principal balance of each Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest at the Prime Rate plus two percent (2.00%) and shall change on each date when the Prime Rate changes.

2.7 Increased Costs.
(a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, or Letters of Credit issued by, the Bank (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Daily Borrowing LIBOR
Rate); or
(ii) impose on the Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement, or DBLR Loans
made by the Bank;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to the Bank of making or maintaining any DBLR Loan (or
of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Bank (whether or principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to the Bank, upon the
Bank’s demand therefor accompanied by the certificate contemplated by section 2.7(c), such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If the Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on the Bank’s capital or on the capital of the Bank’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by the Bank to a level below that which the Bank or the Bank’s holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration the Bank’s policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to the Bank, upon the Bank’s demand therefor accompanied by the certificate
contemplated by section 2.7(c), such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank or the Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of the Bank setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in sections
2.7(a) or 2.7(b) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. The Borrower shall pay the Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate (absent demonstrable error in such certificate) within 10 Business
Days after receipt thereof by the Borrower.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of the Bank to demand compensation pursuant to
this section shall not constitute a waiver of the Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate the Bank pursuant to this section for any amount or amounts that would otherwise
be payable under this section accruing


17










more than 270 days prior to the date that the Borrower receives the applicable certificate pursuant to section 2.11(c); provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
amount or amounts is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
2.8 Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation
of any of the Loan Parties hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any of the Loan Parties shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this section) the Bank receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
law. In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b) Each of the Loan Parties shall indemnify the Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor accompanied by a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount demanded , for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Bank on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any of the Loan Parties hereunder or the other Loan Documents (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted
on or attributable to amounts payable under this section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Loan Parties Representative by the Bank shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.

(c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any of the Loan Parties to a Governmental Authority,
the Loan Parties shall deliver to the Bank the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Bank.

8. Guaranty.

8.1 Guaranty. Each of the Loan Guarantors hereby agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for, and, as primary obligor and
not merely as surety, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to the Bank the prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of the Obligations (the “Guaranteed
Obligations”). Each of the Loan Guarantors further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed in whole or in part without notice to or further assent from it, and that it remains bound upon its guarantee
notwithstanding any such extension or renewal. All terms of this apply to and may be enforced by or on behalf of any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of the Bank that extended any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations.

8.2 Guaranty of Payment. This Loan Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. Each of the Loan Guarantors waives any
right to require the Bank to sue the Borrower or any of the other Loan Guarantors, any other guarantor, or any other person obligated for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (each, an “Obligated Party” and collectively,
the “Obligated Parties”), or otherwise to enforce its payment against any collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.
8.3 No Discharge or Diminishment of Loan Guaranty.
(a) Except as
otherwise provided for herein, the obligations of each of the Loan Guarantors hereunder are unconditional and absolute and not subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of
the Guaranteed Obligations), including: (i) any claim of waiver, release, extension, renewal, settlement, surrender, alteration, or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any change in the
corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower, any other of the Loan Guarantors or any other guarantor of or other person liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, liquidation,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any of the Obligated Parties, or such Obligated Party’s property or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any of the Obligated Parties; or (iv) the existence of any
claim, setoff or other rights which any Loan Guarantor may have at any time against any Obligated Party, the Bank or any other person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions.


35









(b) The obligations of each of the Loan Guarantors hereunder are not subject to any defense
or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit
payment by any of the Obligated Parties, of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof.
(c) Further, the obligations of
any of the Loan Guarantors hereunder are not discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure of the Bank to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(ii) any waiver or modification of or supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations (other than any of the foregoing in which the Bank expressly modifies the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder);
(iii) any release, non-perfection, or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for the obligations of the Borrower or of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligations of any other guarantor of or other person liable for
any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any action or failure to act by the Bank with respect to any collateral securing any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than actions or failures to act by the Bank or any of its Affiliates
constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct); or (v) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might
in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Loan Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any of the Loan Guarantors as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations or
actions or failures to act by the Bank or any of its Affiliates constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct).
8.4
Defenses Waived. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Loan Guarantors hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any of the Loan Guarantors or the unenforceability of all or
any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower or any of the Loan Guarantors, other than the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations or any defense arising from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Bank or any of its Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Loan Guarantors irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any person against any of the other Obligated Parties, or any other person. The Bank may, at its election, foreclose on
any collateral securing the Obligations held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or fail to act with respect to any collateral securing all or a part
of the Guaranteed Obligations, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with any of the Obligated Parties or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against any of the Obligated Parties,
without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of such Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully paid in cash or to the extent the Bank or any of its Affiliates acts or fails to
act in a manner constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Loan Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election even though that election may operate, pursuant
to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any of the Loan Guarantors against any of the Obligated Parties or any security.


36









8.5 Rights of Subrogation. No Loan Guarantor will assert any right, claim or cause of
action, including, without limitation, a claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against any of the Obligated Parties, or any collateral, until the Loan Parties and the Loan Guarantors have fully performed all their
obligations to the Bank hereunder, under the Loan Documents and under any agreement, document or instrument evidencing Related Rate Management Transactions.
8.6 Reinstatement; Stay of Acceleration. If at any time any payment of any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, or reorganization of the Borrower, each of the Loan Guarantors’ obligations under this Loan Guaranty with respect to that payment shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been made and whether or not the Bank
is in possession of this Loan Guaranty. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration
under the terms of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the Loan Guarantors forthwith on demand by the Bank.
8.7 Information. Each of the Loan Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower’s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances
bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each of the Loan Guarantors assumes and incurs under this Loan Guaranty, and agrees that the Bank shall not have any duty to advise
any of the Loan Guarantors of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.
8.8 Termination. The
Bank may continue to make loans or extend credit to the Borrower based on this Loan Guaranty until five days after it receives written notice of termination from any of the Loan Guarantors. Notwithstanding receipt of any such notice, each of the
Loan Guarantors will continue to be liable to the Bank for any Guaranteed Obligations created, assumed or committed to prior to the fifth day after receipt of the notice, and all subsequent renewals, extensions, modifications and amendments with
respect to, or substitutions for, all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations. Any Loan Guarantor’s liability under this Agreement (including, without limitation, under this Loan Guaranty) shall automatically cease if such Loan Guarantor
ceases to be a Subsidiary as the result of a transaction or series of related transactions that are not prohibited by this Agreement, and the Bank agrees to deliver to the Borrower such instruments of release or other documentation as the Borrower
may reasonably request to evidence any such cessation of liability.
All payments of the Guaranteed Obligations will be made
giving effect to the section 2.8.
8.9 Maximum Liability. The provisions of this Loan Guaranty are severable, and in
any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any of the Loan Guarantors under this
Loan Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of such Loan Guarantor’s liability under this Loan Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Loan Guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Loan Guarantors or the Bank, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such
action or proceeding (such highest amount determined


37










hereunder being the relevant Loan Guarantor’s “Maximum Liability”). This section with respect to the Maximum Liability of each of the Loan Guarantors is intended solely to
preserve the rights of the Bank to the maximum extent not subject to avoidance under applicable law, and no Loan Guarantor nor any other person or entity shall have any right or claim under this section with respect to such Maximum Liability, except
to the extent necessary so that the obligations of any of the Loan Guarantors hereunder shall not be rendered voidable under applicable law. Each of the Loan Guarantors agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time
exceed the Maximum Liability of each of the Loan Guarantors without impairing this Loan Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Bank hereunder; provided that, nothing in this sentence shall be construed to increase any of the
Loan Guarantors’ obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.
8.10 Contribution. In the event any of the
Loan Guarantors (a “Paying Guarantor”) shall make any payment or payments under this Loan Guaranty or shall suffer any loss as a result of any realization upon any collateral granted by it to secure its obligations under this Loan
Guaranty, each of the other Loan Guarantors (each a “Non-Paying Guarantor”) shall contribute to such Paying Guarantor an amount equal to such Non-Paying Guarantor’s “Applicable Percentage” of such payment or payments
made, or losses suffered, by such Paying Guarantor. For purposes of this section 8.10, each Non-Paying Guarantor’s “Applicable Percentage” with respect to any such payment or loss by a Paying Guarantor shall be determined as of
the date on which such payment or loss was made by reference to the ratio of (a) such Non-Paying Guarantor’s Maximum Liability as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution
hereunder) or, if such Non-Paying Guarantor’s Maximum Liability has not been determined, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Non-Paying Guarantor from the Borrower after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by
other means) to (b) the aggregate Maximum Liability of all Loan Guarantors hereunder (including such Paying Guarantor) as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder), or to the
extent that a Maximum Liability has not been determined for any Loan Guarantor, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Loan Guarantors from the Borrower after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means).
Nothing in this provision shall affect any of the Loan Guarantors’ several liability for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (up to such Loan Guarantor’s Maximum Liability). Each of the Loan Guarantors covenants and agrees that
its right to receive any contribution under this Loan Guaranty from a Non-Paying Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. This provision is for the benefit of the
Bank and the Loan Guarantors and may be enforced by any one, or more, or all of them in accordance with the terms hereof.

8.11 Liability Cumulative. The liability of each of the Loan Parties as one of the Loan Guarantors under this Article 8 is in
addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each of the Loan Parties to the Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party or in respect of any obligations or liabilities of the other Loan
Parties, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.
9. Miscellaneous.
9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.
The representations and warranties contained in section 3 hereof and in the other Loan Documents shall survive closing and execution and delivery of the Notes.


38









9.2 Indemnification. Except as incurred as a result of the Bank’s willful
misconduct or gross negligence, each of the Loan Parties agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Bank, its directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all loss, cost, expense or liability (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with any and all claims or proceedings (whether brought by a private party or Governmental Authority) as a result of, or arising out of or relating to:

(a) bodily injury, property damage, abatement or remediation, environmental damage or impairment or any other injury or damage resulting
from or relating to any Hazardous Materials located on or migrating into, from or through property previously, now or hereafter owned or occupied by any of the Loan Parties, which the Bank may incur due to the making of the Loans, the exercise of
any of its rights under the Collateral Documents, or otherwise;
(b) any transaction financed or to be financed, in whole or
in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Loan; or
(c) the entering into, performance of and exercise of its
rights under any Loan Document by the Bank.
This indemnity will survive foreclosure of any security interest or mortgage or
conveyance in lieu of foreclosure and the repayment of the Notes and the discharge and release of any Collateral Documents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing indemnity shall not be available to the extent that such losses, costs, expenses or
liabilities result from a claim brought by any of the Loan Parties against any indemnitee for breach of the Bank’s or its Affiliates’ respective obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the applicable Loan Party has
obtained a final judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction.

9.3 Expenses. Each of the Loan Parties agree, whether or not the transaction hereby contemplated shall be consummated, to pay on
demand (accompanied by a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount demanded) (a) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Bank in connection with the negotiation, execution, administration, amendment or enforcement of any Loan Document
including the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the Bank’s legal counsel, and (b) all out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Bank’s legal counsel, incurred by the Bank in connection with
any litigation, proceeding or dispute in any way related to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Bank agrees to provide written notice to the Loan Parties Representative at any time it has incurred amounts for which it will seek
reimbursement under this section 9.3 in an aggregate amount exceeding $25,000; provided that failure to provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of the Loan Parties under this section 9.3. The obligations of each of the Loan
Parties under this section 9.3 will survive payment of the Notes.

The Bank or the Loan Parties Representative may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by
electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.
9.5 Setoff. As security for payment of the Obligations, each of the Loan Parties grants to the Bank a security interest in and lien on any credit balance or other money now or hereafter owed such
Loan Party by the Bank. In addition, each of the Loan Parties agrees that the Bank may, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, without prior notice, set off against any such credit balance or other money
all or any part of the Obligations, irrespective of whether the Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. The Bank agrees to provide prompt written notice of
any such setoff to the Borrower, provided that any failure to give any such notice shall not invalidate the applicable setoff.
9.6 Participations. Each of the Loan Parties agree that the Bank may, at its option, sell to another financial institution or institutions participation interests in any Note and, in


40










connection with each such sale and thereafter, disclose to the purchaser or prospective purchaser of each such interest financial and other information concerning such Loan Party (subject to such
purchaser or prospective purchaser agreeing to treat such information as confidential as set forth in section 9.16). In the event of a sale by the Bank of a participating interest to a purchaser, (a) the Bank’s obligations hereunder shall
remain unchanged for all purposes and the Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (b) each of the Loan Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Bank in connection with the Bank’s
rights and obligations hereunder, (c) all amounts payable by any of the Loan Parties shall be paid directly to the Bank, (d) the Bank shall not transfer or grant any participating interest under which the purchaser has the right to approve
any amendment to, or any consent or waive with respect to, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except to (i) extend the final maturity date of the Loans hereunder in which such purchaser is participating, (ii) reduce the
interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder in which such purchaser is participating, (iii) release all or substantially all of the collateral or guaranties (except to the extent expressly provided herein or in any of the Loan Documents)
supporting the Loans hereunder in which such purchaser is participating, (iv) postpone the payment of, or reduce the amount of, the interest or fees payable to such purchaser through the Bank (other than a waiver of default interest) or
(v) change the amount or due dates of scheduled principal repayments or prepayments or premiums and (e) all amounts payable by any of the Loan Parties hereunder shall (except as set forth below) be determined as if the Bank had not sold
such participation. Each of the Loan Parties agree that if any portion of the Obligations are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each such purchaser shall be
deemed to have, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owed directly to it. Each of the Loan Parties further
agree that each such purchaser shall be entitled to the benefits of section 2.7(d) with respect to its participation in the Bank’s obligation to make Loans; provided that no such purchaser shall be entitled to receive any greater amount
pursuant to that section than the Bank would have been entitled to receive if no such sale had occurred.
9.7 Titles.
The titles of sections in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not limit or construe the meaning of any section.

9.8 Severability. In case any provision or obligation under any Loan Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

9.9 Parties Bound; Waiver. The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon any successor of any
of the parties hereto; provided that none of the rights of any of the Loan Parties under this Agreement are assignable, and provided, further, that the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) shall be required unless (a) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment, (b) such assignment is to an Affiliate of the Bank or (c) such assignment occurs with the sale of all or
substantially all of the Bank’s assets. No delay on the part of the Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights provided for in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights, powers, privileges or
remedies provided by law or in equity, or under any other instrument, documents or agreement now existing or hereafter arising.

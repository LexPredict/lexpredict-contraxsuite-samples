Borrowing Base Period  commencing  September 1, 2007, and effective as
of the date set forth in a notice of redetermination  delivered to the
Borrower.

(c)  The  determination  of the  Borrowing  Base shall be made, at the sole
discretion of the Lender,  by reviewing the estimates of the projected
rate of  production  and projected  revenues  from the Borrowing  Base
Properties   and  such  other  credit  factors   (including,   without
limitation,  the assets,  liabilities,  cash flow,  current Derivative
Contracts, business, properties,  prospects,  management and ownership
of  the  Borrower)  as  the  Lender  in  its  sole  discretion   deems
significant. The Lender may make adjustments, in good faith and at its
sole  discretion and in accordance  with its customary  practices,  to
such  estimates of the  projected  rate of  production  and  projected
revenues.

(d)  In addition to scheduled Borrowing Base  redeterminations  pursuant to
Subsection   2.6(b),   the  Lender  or  the   Borrower   may  cause  a
redetermination  of the  Borrowing  Base at any one time  during  each
Borrowing  Base  Period.  In the event the  Borrower  requests  such a
Borrowing Base  redetermination,  the Borrower  shall deliver  written
notice of such  request to the Lender  with (i) a report,  in form and
substance  satisfactory to the Lender,  prepared by Scotia Group, Inc.
or  another  independent  petroleum  engineer  or  firm  of  engineers
reasonably  acceptable to the Lender, which report shall set forth, as
of a date not more than sixty (60)  calendar days prior to the date of
such  request,  projections  of future  net income  from  hydrocarbons
classified as "Proved  Reserves"  attributable to all of the Borrowing
Base Properties,  (ii) such other information  concerning such Oil and
Gas  Properties  as the  Lender  may  reasonably  request,  including,
without limitation,  engineering, geological and performance data, and
(iii) the amount of the  Borrowing  Base  requested by the Borrower to
become  effective.  Likewise,  in the event the Lender  exercises  its
option  for  a  Borrowing  Base   redetermination   pursuant  to  this
Subsection 2.6(d), upon written request and notification by the Lender
to the Borrower,  the Borrower shall furnish the information described
above  within  thirty  (30) days of such  request.  The  Lender  shall
redetermine  the Borrowing Base in accordance  with the procedures set
forth in Subsection  2.6(c) which  redetermined  Borrowing  Base shall
then be the effective Borrowing Base until further redetermination.

(e)  The  Borrower  agrees  to pay  to the  Lender  an  engineering  fee of
$2,500.00  upon the execution and delivery of this  Agreement and upon
each redetermination of the Borrowing Base as set forth in Subsections
2.6 (b) and (d).

2.7 Interest Rates.  Principal  amounts of Advances  outstanding  under the
Notes shall bear interest at the Facility Rate (but in no event greater than the
Highest Lawful Rate), calculated on the basis of a year consisting of sixty-five
(365) or three hundred  sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be. Should default
occur in the payment of the Notes and collection proceedings be instituted,  all
past due  interest  and  principal  under the Notes  shall bear  interest at the
lesser of the Highest Lawful Rate,  calculated on the basis of a year consisting
of three hundred  sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the
case may be, or the Default Rate,  calculated on the basis of a year  consisting
of three hundred  sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the
case may be, and if no Highest  Lawful Rate  exists,  all past due  interest and
principal under the Notes shall bear interest at the Default Rate, calculated on
the  basis of a year  consisting  of  three  hundred  sixty-five  (365) or three
hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be.

2.8 General  Provisions  Relating to Interest.  It is the  intention of the
parties hereto to comply  strictly with the  applicable  usury Laws as in effect
from time to time; and in this connection, there shall never be taken, reserved,
contracted  for,  collected,  charged  or  received  on any  Loan  or any  other
Obligation  interest in excess of that which would accrue at the Highest  Lawful
Rate.  To the  extent  that the  interest  rate  Laws of the  State of Texas are
applicable to the Loans,  for purposes of Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code,
as  amended,  the  Borrower  agrees  that the  Highest  Lawful Rate shall be the
"weekly rate ceiling" as defined in such  chapter,  provided that the Lender may
also rely, to the extent  permitted by applicable  Laws, on alternative  maximum
rates of interest under such other applicable Laws, if greater.


20
<PAGE>


If under any  circumstances  the aggregate  amount paid on the  Obligations
includes  amounts that are by Law deemed to be interest which exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate (the "excess  interest"),  the Borrower stipulates that such payment
and  collection  will have been and will be deemed to have been,  to the fullest
extent  permitted by applicable  Laws, the result of  mathematical  error on the
part of the Borrower and the Lender,  and the Lender shall  promptly  credit the
amount of such  excess  interest  on the  principal  amount  of the  outstanding
Obligations,  or if the principal amount of the Obligations shall have been paid
in full,  refund  the excess  interest  to the  Borrower.  In the event that the
maturity  of the Notes is  accelerated  by reason of an  election  of the Lender
resulting  from any Event of Default  or by reason of  operation  of  Subsection
7.3(a),  or in the  event  of  any  prepayment,  then  such  consideration  that
constitutes  interest  under Laws  applicable to the Lender may never exceed the
Highest Lawful Rate,  and excess  interest,  if any,  provided for in the Notes,
this Agreement or otherwise shall be cancelled automatically by the Lender as of
the date of such  acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore  paid, shall be
credited by the Lender on the  principal  amount of the  Obligations,  or if the
principal  amount of the Obligations  shall have been paid in full,  refunded by
the Lender to the Borrower.

All  sums  paid,  or  agreed  to be  paid,  to  the  Lender  for  the  use,
forbearance,  and  detention of the  proceeds of the Loans shall,  to the extent
permitted by  applicable  Law, be  amortized,  prorated,  allocated,  and spread
throughout  the  full  term of the  Obligations  until  paid in full so that the
actual rate of interest is uniform, but does not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate,
throughout the full term hereof.

2.9 Facility Fees. Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Lender, the Borrower will pay the Lender a facility fee of $90,000.00.

2.10 Increase in Borrowing  Base Fee. The Borrower  shall pay to the Lender
as a fee for any increase in the Borrowing Base resulting from  redeterminations
under Section 2.6 hereof to an amount  greater than any  previously  established
Borrowing  Base,  a fee equal to one  percent  (1.0%) of the amount by which the
Borrowing  Base was  increased  from the  amount of the  previously  established
highest  Borrowing  Base.  Any fee arising under this Section is to be paid upon
the effective date of the related Borrowing Base increase.

2.11  Loans to  Satisfy  Obligations.  The  Lender  may,  but  shall not be
obligated to, make Loans and apply proceeds  thereof to the  satisfaction of any
warranty, representation, covenant or other Obligation of the Borrower contained
in this Agreement or the other Loan  Documents and which are  necessary,  in the
commercially reasonable opinion of the Lender, to enforce its Rights, protect or
preserve  the  Collateral  or the Liens  thereon  in favor of the Lender and the
priorities  thereof,  or avoid a Material Adverse Effect, and  contemporaneously
with so doing,  the Lender shall furnish the Borrower  written  notice as to the
amount and date of any such Loan.  Any funds so advanced  and  applied  shall be
evidenced  by the  Revolving  Note,  shall be  payable  on demand and shall bear
interest at the Default  Rate from the time of the making of such Loan until the
time of repayment.

2.12  Prepayment  of Term  Note.  (a)  Except  as set  forth  below in this
Subsection  2.12(a),  the Borrower shall not have the right and option to prepay
all or any part of the principal balance outstanding on the Term Note.

Beginning with the  redetermination of the Borrowing Base for the Borrowing
Base Period commencing  September 1, 2008, if the Borrowing Base as redetermined
by the Lender pursuant to Subsection  2.6(b) is less than  $500,000.00 more than
the Borrowing Base as determined for the  immediately  preceding  Borrowing Base
Period pursuant to Subsection 2.6(b), then the Borrower may elect until the next
regularly scheduled  redetermination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to Subection
2.6(b) to prepay all or any portion of the principal  Debt evidenced by the Term
Note.

Upon any  prepayment  of the principal  Debt  evidenced by the Term Note as
permitted by this Subsection  2.12(a),  the Borrower shall (a) repay in full all
Debt evidenced by the Revolving Note and terminate the Revolving  Commitment and
(b) as a prepayment  penalty,  execute and deliver to the Lender a  Supplemental
Warrant for the purchase of a number of shares of Common Stock which is equal to
one  share of  Common  Stock  for  every  $2.00 of  principal  prepayment.  Such
Supplemental Warrant shall be in form of Exhibit XV attached hereto and executed
and delivered to the Lender at the same time of the corresponding prepayment.

Except  as set  forth  above in this  Subsection  2.12(a),  such  permitted
prepayment shall be without premium or penalty.

(b)  In the event of a Change of Control  involving  a Person or Group that
is not an Affiliate  of the  Borrower,  the Borrower  shall prepay the
principal  balance  of  the  Term  Loan  then  outstanding  after  any
conversions as provided in Section 2.15, along with all accrued unpaid
interest.  This prepayment  shall be made  contemporaneously  with the
consummation  of the Change of Control and,  notwithstanding  anything
herein to the contrary, shall be without premium or penalty.

2.13 Mandatory  Prepayment of Revolving Note or Actions in Lieu Thereof. At
any time the outstanding principal Debt evidenced by the Revolving Note shall be
in  excess  of the  Borrowing  Base  as  then  determined,  the  Borrower  shall
immediately,  but in no event later than thirty (30) days  following  receipt of
written  notice given the Lender to the Borrower of such  determination,  at the
Borrower's  election:  (a) prepay the principal  Debt evidenced by the Revolving
Note in an aggregate  amount at least equal to such excess,  which payment shall
be in addition to any  principal  installment  otherwise due during such period;
(b) give  written  notice to the Lender that the  Borrower  shall elect to repay
such excess in five (5) equal monthly installments;  or (c) add to the Borrowing
Base  additional  Oil and Gas Properties  (reasonably  acceptable to the Lender)
sufficient  to  increase  the  Borrowing  Base to equal  the  cumulative  unpaid
principal  amount  evidenced by the Revolving  Note,  the  determination  of the
value,  title and  environmental  status of the Oil and Gas  Properties so added
shall be made by the Lender, at its sole good faith discretion.


22
<PAGE>


If the Borrower elects to repay such excess in five (5) installments,  each
of such installments  shall equal one-fifth (1/5th) of such excess, the first of
such installments  shall be due and payable by the Borrower at the same date the
Lender receives written notice of the Borrower's election as set forth above and
such installments shall thereafter be due and payable by the Borrower monthly on
the same day of the month as the first installment was due and payable and shall
continue until such excess no longer exists.

2.14 Net  Profits  Interests.  As  consideration  for the Loans made by the
Lender pursuant to this  Agreement,  the Borrower agrees to convey to the Lender
upon the repayment in full of the Debt  evidenced by the Revolving  Note and the
repayment  in full or  conversion  of the Debt  evidenced  by the Term  Note and
confirmation  of the title of the Lender to such interest upon conveyance by the
Borrower,  an undivided  five  percent  (5%) net profits  interest in the future
production of  hydrocarbons  from or  attributable  to the Southern  Properties,
which  conveyance  shall be effective  as of the date the Debt  evidenced by the
Revolving  Note is  repaid  in full and the Debt  evidenced  by the Term Note is
repaid in full or converted and evidenced by an instrument  substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit X.

As  consideration  for  the  Loans  made  by the  Lender  pursuant  to this
Agreement,  if the  proceeds  of any Advance  are made to pay or  reimburse  the
Borrower for Dry Hole Costs,  Completion Costs or Workover Costs for any oil and
gas well located on the Northern  Properties,  the Borrower  agrees to convey to
the Lender upon the  repayment in full of the Debt  evidenced  by the  Revolving
Note and the repayment in full or  conversion of the Debt  evidenced by the Term
Note  and  confirmation  of the  title  of the  Lender  to  such  interest  upon
conveyance by the Borrower,  an undivided five percent (5%) net profits interest
in the future  production of  hydrocarbons  from or attributable to the Northern
Properties,  which  conveyance  shall  be  effective  as of the  date  the  Debt
evidenced by the Revolving  Note is repaid in full and the Debt evidenced by the
Term  Note is  repaid  in full  or  converted  and  evidenced  by an  instrument
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit X.

Should the Borrower  elect, at any time subsequent to the conveyance of the
Net Profits  Interests,  to sell its interest in any of the Subject  Properties,
then the  Borrower  agrees  to extend to the  Lender,  by way of prompt  written
notice  setting forth the terms of any such  transaction,  the right to sell the
Net Profits  Interests  burdening the relevant Subject  Properties to be sold by
the Borrower on the same terms (including,  without  limitation,  price based on
per unit of production) as those for the sale by the Borrower. Such right may be
exercised at the sole  discretion of the Lender and, should the Lender elect not
to exercise such right, the Subject  Properties so sold shall be conveyed by way
of  instrument(s)  of  conveyance  made  expressly  subject  to the Net  Profits
Interests and the  provisions  of this  Agreement  applicable  thereto and shall
remain subject to the Net Profits Interests.

2.15 Conversion of Term Note.

(a)  Conversion.  At or  before  the  maturity  of  the  Term  Loan  on the
Termination  Date,  the Lender shall have the option of converting all
or a portion  of the Five  Million  Dollar  ($5,000,000.00)  principal
amount of the Term Note into shares of Common Stock, at the Conversion
Price in  effect  on the  Conversion  Date.  So long as the Term  Note
remains  outstanding,  the Term Note may be  converted  as provided in
this Section 2.15, provided, however, in no event shall more than five
(5)  conversions be made by the Lender  pursuant to this Section 2.15.
This conversion shall be made by the Lender delivering to the Borrower
notice of the conversion of the Term Note (the "Conversion Notice") in
the form  attached  as  Exhibit  X. Each  conversion  shall be made in
multiples  of  One  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000.00)  of  the
principal balance of the Term Loan then outstanding or the outstanding
principal of the Term Note if less than One Hundred  Thousand  Dollars
($100,000.00).  The Conversion  Date of each  conversion  shall be the
date the  Conversion  Notice is received by the Borrower or such other
date  as  provided  in the  Conversion  Notice.  Upon  receipt  of the
Conversion  Notice,  the Borrower  shall (i) cause its transfer  agent
promptly to issue to the Lender a stock  certificate  representing the
shares of Common Stock  issuable to the Lender under this Section 2.15
and (ii) if any principal amount of the Term Note remains outstanding,
issue to the Lender a new Term Note dated the  Conversion  Date in the
principal amount equal to the principal  balance of the Term Loan then
outstanding  after the conversion.  The Borrower shall pay all accrued
unpaid  interest on the Term Loan through the Conversion  Date on that
date or, if the Conversion  Date is not a scheduled  interest  payment
date, the next payment date.

(b)  Adjustment  of Conversion  Price;  Number of Shares  Issued.  From the
Closing Date until  conversion of all of the  principal  amount of the
Term Note or its repayment at maturity,  the Conversion Price shall be
subject  to  adjustment  when  and as  provided  in  the  Antidilution
Provisions. In the event of a partial conversion of the Term Note, the
Conversion Price shall thereafter be subject to adjustment as provided
in the  Antidilution  Provisions  with respect to future  conversions.
Upon conversion of the Term Note, the number of shares of Common Stock
to be issued to the Lender  shall be the number of shares  obtained by
dividing  the  principal  amount of the Term Note being  converted  as
provided in the Conversion Notice by the Conversion Price in effect on
the  Conversion  Date. No  fractional  shares of Common Stock shall be
issued, and, in lieu of issuing a fractional share, the Borrower shall
pay to the Lender the portion of the principal amount of the Term Note
not  converted  into Common Stock  because the fraction of a share was
not issued.  The Borrower  agrees to comply with all of the  covenants
and other provisions set forth in the Antidilution Provisions.

(c)  Restrictive  Legend.  Until  such time as the  shares of Common  Stock
issued  to  the  Lender  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.15  have  been
registered  for  transfer  pursuant to the  Securities  Act, the stock
certificates  representing  those  shares  shall  bear  the  following
restrictive legend or a substantially similar legend:

"THE SHARES  REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE  HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED  UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE
TRANSFERRED  IN  THE  ABSENCE  OF  SUCH  REGISTRATION  OR AN
EXEMPTION THEREFROM UNDER SUCH ACT."


24
<PAGE>


(d)  Registration  Rights.  The shares of Common Stock issued to the Lender
pursuant to this Section  2.15,  along with any shares of Common Stock
issued upon exercise of the Warrant or a Supplemental  Warrant,  shall
be entitled to the  registration  rights set forth in the Registration
Rights Agreement.

(e)  Compliance with Other  Provisions.  The Borrower shall comply with its
covenants and agreements contained in the Registration Right Agreement
and, if issued,  the Supplemental  Warrant as if those provisions were
included in this  Agreement.  Notwithstanding  anything  herein to the
contrary,  the obligation  provided in this  Subsection  2.15(e) shall
remain  in force and  effect  so long has the  Lender is holder of the
Warrant, the Supplemental  Warrant(s) or shares of Common Stock issued
to it pursuant to this  Section  2.15 or shares of Common Stock issued
upon exercise of the Warrant or a Supplemental Warrant.

2.16 Warrant. As consideration for the Loans made by the Lender pursuant to
this  Agreement,  the Borrower at the Closing,  shall (a) execute and deliver to
the Lender the Warrant in the form attached  herto as Exhibit XIVand (b) execute
and deliver with the Lender a Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit XIII.  The Borrower shall comply with the terms and provisions
of the Warrant and the Registration  Rights Agreement so long as that instrument
and those agreements remain in force and effect.

2.17 Increased Costs.  (a) If the Lender  determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on the  Lender's  capital or on the  capital of the  Lender's  holding
company,  if any, as a  consequence  of this  Agreement or the Loan made by such
Lender to a level below that which the Lender or the  Lender's  holding  company
could have  achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into  consideration  the
Lender's  policies and the policies of the Lender's holding company with respect
to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to the Lender
such additional  amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender or the Lender's
holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(b) A  certificate  of the  Lender  setting  forth the  amount  or  amounts
necessary to compensate the Lender or its holding  company,  as the case may be,
as specified in Subsection 2.17(a) and reasonably detailed calculations therefor
shall be  delivered  to the Borrower  and shall be  conclusive  absent  manifest
error.  The  Borrower  shall pay the Lender the amount  shown as due on any such
certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.

(c)  Failure  or delay on the part of the  Lender  to  demand  compensation
pursuant to this  Section  2.17 shall not  constitute  a waiver of the  Lender's
right to demand  such  compensation;  provided  that the  Borrower  shall not be
required to compensate  the Lender  pursuant to this Section for any  reductions
incurred  more than one  hundred  eighty  (180)  days prior to the date that the
Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such reductions
and of the Lender's intention to claim compensation  therefor;  provided further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such reductions is  retroactive,  then
the one hundred  eighty (180) day period  referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.


25
<PAGE>


2.18 Taxes.  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrower  under any Loan  Document  shall be made free and clear of and  without
deduction  for any  Indemnified  Taxes  or  Other  Taxes;  provided  that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments,  then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after  making  all  required  deductions  (including  deductions  applicable  to
additional sums payable under this Section), the Lender receives an amount equal
to the sum it would have  received had no such  deductions  been made,  (ii) the
Borrower  shall make such  deductions  and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant Tribunal in accordance with applicable law.

The  Borrower  shall  pay any  Other  Taxes  to the  relevant  Tribunal  in
accordance with applicable law.

The Borrower shall indemnify the Lender, within ten (10) days after written
demand  therefor,  for the full amount of any  Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes
paid by the Lender as the case may be, on or with  respect to any  payment by or
on account of any obligation of the Borrower  hereunder  (including  Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or  attributable  to amounts payable
under this Section) and any penalties,  interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom  or with respect  thereto,  whether or not such  Indemnified  Taxes or
Other  Taxes were  correctly  or legally  imposed or  asserted  by the  relevant
Tribunal.  A  certificate  of the  Lender as to the  amount of such  payment  or
liability under this Section and reasonably detailed calculations therefor shall
be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

As soon as  practicable  after any  payment of  Indemnified  Taxes or Other
Taxes  by  the  Borrower  to a  Tribunal,  the  Borrower  shall  deliver  to the
Administrative  Agent the  original or a certified  copy of a receipt  issued by
such Tribunal  evidencing  such  payment,  a copy of the return  reporting  such
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.

exhibits  hereto are only for the  convenience  of the  parties and shall not be
construed  to have any effect or meaning  with  respect to the other  content of
such  articles,  Sections,  Subsections or other  divisions,  such other content
being controlling as to the agreement between the parties hereto.

8.12  Jurisdiction.  All actions or proceedings  with respect to the Notes,
this  Agreement  or any of the other Loan  Documents  may be  instituted  in the
courts of the State of Texas, County of Harris, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Texas, or elsewhere to the extent that jurisdiction
shall exist apart from the provisions of this Section,  as the Lender may elect.
By  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement,  the  Borrower  irrevocably  and
unconditionally  submits to the jurisdiction  (both subject matter and personal)
of each such court, and irrevocably and unconditionally waives (a) any objection
it may now or  hereafter  have to the laying of venue in any of such  courts and
(b) any claim that any action or  proceeding  brought in any of such  courts has
been brought in an inconvenient  forum.  The choice of forum and laying of venue
as set forth in this Section 8.12 were  negotiated in good faith by the Borrower
and the Lender and is a significant term of the bargain between the Borrower and
the Lender governed by this Agreement.  Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents  to service of process in the manner  provided  for  notices in Section
8.1.  Nothing  in this  Agreement  will  affect  the  right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

8.13  Counterparts.   This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  two  or  more
counterparts and multiple  originals of such  counterparts,  and it shall not be
necessary  that the  signatures  of all parties  hereto be  contained on any one
counterpart  hereof. Any executed Agreement or any counterpart  thereof shall be
deemed an original,  but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

8.14  Effectiveness.  This Agreement shall not be effective until delivered
to, accepted and executed by the Lender and the Borrower.

other  document  provided or to be provided  under the terms  hereof shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.

8.16 Rights of Third Person.  All  provisions of this Agreement are imposed
solely and exclusively for the benefit of the Lender and the Borrower.  No other
Person  shall have  standing  to require  satisfaction  for such  provisions  in
accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that the Lender will refuse
to perform its  obligations  hereunder in the absence of strict  compliance with
any or all thereof,  and any or all of such  provisions  may be freely waived in
whole or in part by the Lender at any time if in its sole discretion it deems it
advisable to do so.

8.17  Announcements.  Each party  covenants and agrees with the other that,
subject to applicable law, each party shall promptly advise and consult with the
other and obtain the other's  written  consent  before issuing any press release
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions described herein.

8.18  Survival  of  Certain  Covenants.   The  covenants,   agreements  and
obligations of the Borrower set forth in Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.17, 2.18 and 8.3
of this  Agreement,  the Warrant,  a  Supplemental  Warrant or the  Registration
Rights  Agreement  shall  survive  repayment of the Debt  evidenced by the Notes
until  those  covenants,  agreements  and  obligations  are  fully  and  finally
performed.

8.19 JURY TRIAL WAIVED.  THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER HEREBY AGREE THAT THEY
SHALL AND HEREBY WAIVE,  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT  DETERMINED BY LAW, TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM,  WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT
BY  ANY OF  THEM  OR IN  ANY  MATTER  WHATSOEVER  WHICH  ARISES  OUT OF OR IS IN
CONNECTION IN ANY ANYWAY WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

8.20 GOVERNING  LAW. THIS  AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS  SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND  CONSTRUED IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA AND THE STATE OF TEXAS  (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE  LOCATION OR NATURE OF
THE COLLATERAL REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO BE
APPLIED AS TO MATTERS OF  CREATION,  PERFECTION  AND  PRIORITY  OF LIENS AND THE
RIGHTS OF THE LENDER UPON DEFAULT).

8.21 Arbitration.

(a)  Arbitration.  Upon the  demand  of any  party,  any  dispute  shall be
resolved by binding  arbitration (except as set forth in (e) below) in
accordance  with the terms of this  agreement.  A "dispute" shall mean
any action,  dispute,  claim or  controversy  of any kind,  whether in
contract or tort,  statutory or common law,  legal or  equitable,  now
existing or hereafter  arising under or in connection  with, or in any
way pertaining to, any of the loan documents,  or any past, present or
future  extensions  of credit and other  activities,  transactions  or
obligations  of any kind related  directly or indirectly to any of the
loan documents,  including  without  limitation,  any of the foregoing
arising in connection with the exercise of any self-help, ancillary or
other remedies pursuant to any of the loan documents. Any party may by
summary  proceedings bring an action in court to compel arbitration of
a dispute.  Any party who fails or  refuses  to submit to  arbitration
following a lawful  demand by any other party shall bear all costs and
expenses incurred by such other party in compelling arbitration of any
dispute.

(b)  Governing Rules.  Arbitration proceedings shall be administered by the
American  Arbitration  Association ("AAA") or such other administrator
as the parties shall  mutually  agree upon in accordance  with the AAA
commercial  arbitration  rules. All disputes  submitted to arbitration
shall be  resolved in  accordance  with the  Federal  Arbitration  Act
(Title 9 of the United States Code),  notwithstanding  any conflicting
choice of law provision in any of the loan documents.  The arbitration
shall be conducted at a location in Texas selected by the AAA or other
administrator.  If there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof
and any such rules,  the terms and  procedures  set forth herein shall
control.  All statutes of  limitation  applicable to any dispute shall
apply to any arbitration proceeding. All discovery activities shall be
expressly  limited to matters  directly  relevant to the dispute being
arbitrated.  Judgment upon any award rendered in an arbitration may be
entered  in any court  having  jurisdiction;  provided  however,  that
nothing  contained  herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any party
that is a lender of the protections  afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. 91
or any similar applicable state law.

(c)  No  Waiver;  Provisional  Remedies,   Self-Help  And  Foreclosure.  No
provision  hereof  shall  limit  the  right of any  party to  exercise
self-help remedies such as setoff,  foreclosure against or sale of any
real  or  personal  property  collateral  or  security,  or to  obtain
provisional  or  ancillary  remedies,   including  without  limitation
injunctive  relief,  sequestration,  attachment,  garnishment or other
appointment  of a  receiver,  from a court of  competent  jurisdiction
before,  after or during  the  pendency  of any  arbitration  or other
proceeding.  The exercise of any such remedy shall not waive the right
of any party to compel arbitration hereunder.

(d)  Arbitrator  Qualifications  And Powers;  Awards.  Arbitrators  must be
active   members  of  the  Texas  state  bar  with  expertise  in  the
substantive  laws  applicable  to the subject  matter of the  dispute.
Arbitrators  are empowered to resolve  disputes by summary  rulings in
response  to motions  filed  prior to the final  arbitration  hearing.
Arbitrators  (i) shall  resolve all  disputes in  accordance  with the
substantive  law of the state of Texas,  (ii) may grant any  remedy or
relief that a court of the state of Texas could order or grant  within
the scope  hereof and such  ancillary  relief as is  necessary to make
effective any award,  and (iii) shall have the power to award recovery
of all costs and fees,  to  impose  sanctions  and to take such  other
actions  as they  deem  necessary  to the same  extent  a judge  could
pursuant to the federal rules of civil  procedure,  the Texas rules of


52
<PAGE>


civil  procedure  or other  applicable  law.  Any dispute in which the
amount in  controversy  is  $5,000,000  or less  shall be decided by a
single  arbitrator  who shall  not  render  an award of  greater  than
$5,000,000   (including  damages,   costs,  fees  and  expenses).   By
submission to a single  arbitrator,  each party  expressly  waives any
right or claim to recover more than  $5,000,000.  Any dispute in which
the  amount in  controversy  exceeds  $5,000,000  shall be  decided by
majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators;  provided however, that
all three  arbitrators  must actively  participate in all hearings and
deliberations.

(e)  Judicial Review.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, in
any   arbitration   in  which  the  amount  in   controversy   exceeds
$25,000,000,  the  arbitrators  shall be  required  to make  specific,
written findings of fact and conclusions of law. In such  arbitrations
(i) the  arbitrators  shall not have the power to make any award which
is not  supported by  substantial  evidence or which is based on legal
error,  (ii) an award shall not be binding upon the parties unless the
findings  of  fact  are  supported  by  substantial  evidence  and the
conclusions of law are not erroneous  under the substantive law of the
state of Texas,  and (iii) the  parties  shall have in addition to the
grounds  referred  to in the  federal  arbitration  act for  vacating,
modifying or correcting  an award the right to judicial  review of (a)
whether the findings of fact rendered by the arbitrators are supported
by substantial  evidence,  and (b) whether the  conclusions of law are
erroneous under the  substantive  law of the state of Texas.  Judgment
confirming  an award in such a  proceeding  may be  entered  only if a
court  determines the award is supported by  substantial  evidence and
not based on legal  error  under the  substantive  law of the state of
Texas.

(f)  Miscellaneous.  To  the  maximum  extent  practicable,  the  AAA,  the
arbitrators and the parties shall take all action required to conclude
any  arbitration  proceeding  within  180  days of the  filing  of the
dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator  or other party to an  arbitration
proceeding  may disclose the  existence,  content or results  thereof,
except for  disclosures  of  information  by a party  required  in the
ordinary course of its business,  by applicable law or regulation,  or
to the extent  necessary to exercise any  judicial  review  rights set
forth herein. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between
the  parties  potentially  applies  to  a  dispute,   the  arbitration
provision  most directly  related to the loan documents or the subject
matter of the dispute shall control.  This arbitration provision shall
survive  termination,  amendment  or  expiration  of any  of the  loan
documents or any relationship between the parties.

8.22 USA Patriot Act Notice.  The Lender hereby  notifies the Borrower that
pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56
(signed into law October 26, 2001)), it is required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies the Borrower,  which  information  includes the name
and address of the Borrower and other  information that will allow the Lender to
identify the Borrower in accordance with such Law.


8.23 Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain
the  entire   agreement   between  the  parties  relating  to  the  transactions
contemplated    hereby.   All   prior   or    contemporaneous    understandings,
representations,  statements and agreements, whether written or oral, are merged
herein and superseded by this  Agreement.  THIS WRITTEN  AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
TRANSACTION  DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY
NOT BE  CONTRADICTED  BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,  CONTEMPORANEOUS  OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL
AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.  THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL  AGREEMENTS  BETWEEN THE
PARTIES.

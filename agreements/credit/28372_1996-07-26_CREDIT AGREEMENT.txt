according to the intent and purpose herein and therein expressed.

11.8  Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Companies may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of their rights under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Bank.

11.9  Indulgence. No delay or failure of the Bank in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall affect such right, power or privilege
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise
thereof, nor the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights of
the Bank hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which the Bank would otherwise have.

11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, and each executed copy shall constitute an original instrument,
but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same
instrument.

11.11 Amendment and Waiver. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any Loan Document, nor consent to any departure by Companies
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Bank, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

11.12 Confidentiality. Bank agrees that it will not disclose without the
prior consent of Companies (other than to its employees or to its auditors or

41
<PAGE>   47

to the public or has been lawfully obtained by Bank from any third party under
no duty of confidentiality to Companies, (b) as may be required or appropriate
in any report, statement or testimony submitted to, or in respect to any
inquiry, by, any municipal, state or federal regulatory body having or claiming
to have jurisdiction over such Bank, including the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System of the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar
organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors,
(c) as may be required or appropriate in respect to any summons or subpoena or
in connection with any litigation, (d) in order to comply with any law, order,
regulation or ruling applicable to the Bank, and (e) to any transferee or
assignee or to any participant of, or with respect to, the Revolving Credit
Note.

11.13 Effective Upon Execution. This Agreement shall become effective
upon the execution hereof by Bank and Companies and the issuance by Companies
of the Revolving Credit Note hereunder, and shall remain effective until the
Indebtedness has been repaid and discharged in full and no commitment to extend
any credit hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, whether optional
or obligatory, remains outstanding.

11.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. The Bank and Companies, after consulting or
having had the opportunity to consult with counsel, knowingly, voluntarily and
intentionally waive any right any of them may have to a trial by jury in any
litigation based upon or arising out of this Agreement or any related
instrument or agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any course of conduct, dealing, statements (whether oral or
written) or action of any of them. Neither the Bank nor Companies shall seek to
consolidate, by counterclaim or otherwise, any such action in which a jury
trial has been waived with any other action in which a jury trial cannot be or
has not been waived.  These provisions shall not be deemed to have been
modified in any respect or relinquished by the Bank or Companies except by a
written instrument executed by all of them.

11.15 Complete Agreement; Conflicts. This Agreement, the Revolving Credit
Note, any Requests for Advance hereunder, and the Loan Documents contain the
entire agreement of the parties hereto, superseding all prior agreements,
discussions and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof, and none
of the parties shall be bound by anything not expressed in writing. In the
event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, this Agreement shall govern.

11.16 Severability. In case any one or more of the obligations of
Companies under this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Note or any of the other
Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
the validity, legality and





42
<PAGE>   48

enforceability of the remaining obligations of Companies shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, and such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability in one jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of the obligations of Companies under this Agreement, the
Revolving Credit Note or any of the other Loan Documents in any other
jurisdiction.

11.17 Table of Contents and Headings. The table of contents and the
headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for convenience of reference
only and shall in no way modify or affect any of the terms or provisions
hereof.

11.18 Construction of Certain Provisions. If any provision of this
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents refers to any action to be taken by any
Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be
applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person,
whether or not expressly specified in such provision.

11.19 Independence of Covenants. Each covenant hereunder shall be given
independent effect (subject to any exceptions stated in such covenant) so that
if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any such covenant
(taking into account any such stated exception), the fact that it would be
permitted by an exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or any
event or condition which with notice or lapse of time, or both, could become
such an Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

11.20 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions. All terms,
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of Companies or any party
to any of the Loan Documents made herein or in any of the Loan Documents or in
any certificate, report, financial statement or other document furnished by or
on behalf of Companies in connection with this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the Bank, notwithstanding
any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by the Bank or on the Bank's
behalf, and those covenants and agreements of Companies set forth in Sections
8.8 and 11.5 (together with any other indemnities of Companies contained
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any of the Loan Documents) shall survive the
repayment in full of the Indebtedness and the termination of the Revolving
Credit Commitment.

11.21 Concerning Joint and Several Liability of the Companies and Related
Matters.

(a)   Each of the Companies authorizes Detrex with full power and
authority as attorney-in-fact, to execute and deliver Requests for Advances,
requests for issuance of Letters of Credit and each other instrument,
certificate and report to be delivered by the





43
<PAGE>   49

Companies to the Bank pursuant to this Agreement. Each of the Companies agrees
that it shall be bound by any action taken by Detrex on its behalf pursuant to
such appointment.

(b)   Each of the Companies is accepting joint and several liability
hereunder in consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by
the Bank under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly,
of each of the Companies and in consideration of the undertakings of each of
the Companies to accept joint and several liability for the obligations of each
of them.

(c)   Each of the Companies jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint
and several liability with each other Company, with respect to the payment and
performance of all of the obligations arising under this Agreement, it being
the intention of the parties hereto that all the obligations shall be the joint
and several obligations of all the Companies without preferences or distinction
among them.

(d)   If and to the extent that any of the Companies shall fail to make
any payment with respect to any of the obligations hereunder as and when due or
to perform any of such obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then
in each such event, the other Companies will make such payment with respect to,
or perform, such obligation.

(e)   The obligations of each Company under the provisions of this
Agreement constitute full recourse obligations of such Company enforceable
against it to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the
validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other
circumstance whatsoever.

(f)   The obligations of each Company under this Agreement shall not be
diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization,
arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to
any Company or any Bank or the Agent. The joint and several liability of the
Companies hereunder shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any
absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other change whatsoever in the name,
membership, constitution or place of formation of any Company or the Bank.

(g)   The provisions of this Section 11.21 are made for the benefit of
the Bank and its successors and assigns, and may be enforced by them from time
to time against any of the Companies as often as occasion therefor may arise
and without requirement on the part of the Bank first to marshall any of its
claims or to exercise any of its rights against the other Companies or to
exhaust any remedies available to it against the other Companies or to resort
to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the





44
<PAGE>   50

obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this
Section 11.21 shall remain in effect until all the obligations hereunder shall
have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any
payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the obligations, is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Bank upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Companies, or otherwise, the
provisions of this Section 11.21 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as
though such payment had not been made.

11.22       Conflict between Security Agreements, Mortgages and
Agreement. In the event of any express inconsistency between the terms and
provisions of the Security Agreements or the Mortgages and the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
control.

WITNESS the due execution hereof as of the day and year first above
written.

THE CREDITS

2.1. Commitment.

(a) From and including the Effective Date and prior to the Facility
Termination Date, the Bank agrees, on the terms set forth in this Agreement, to
(i) make Advances to the Borrower in Agreed Currencies from time to time, and
(ii) issue Facility LCs upon the request of the Borrower, in Dollar Amounts not
to exceed in the aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding the lesser
of (A) the amount of the Borrowing Base as of the close of business on the last
day of the month next preceding the date any such Advance is made and (B) the
amount of the Commitment as of the date any such Advance is made, provided,
however, that (A) the aggregate principal amount of Facility LCs outstanding at
any time shall not exceed the amount of the Commitment in effect at such time,
and (B) all Floating Rate Loans shall be made and Facility LCs shall be issued
in Dollars. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow,
repay and reborrow at any time prior to the Facility Termination Date. The
Commitment to extend credit hereunder shall expire on the Facility Termination
Date. The Bank will issue Facility LCs hereunder on the terms and conditions set
forth in Section 2.18.

(b) The Bank agrees that this Agreement consolidates, amends,
restates, and supersedes the Existing Credit Agreement, and the Borrower
acknowledges, accepts, and ratifies the Outstanding Facilities evidenced by this
Agreement. All amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement on the
Effective Date shall constitute Advances under Section 2.1(a), with each
existing Eurocurrency Advance remaining outstanding under its existing Interest
Period. Each letter of credit, bankers acceptance, and bank guaranty issued by
the Bank for the Borrower's account which is outstanding under the Existing
Credit Agreement on the Effective Date (other than the IRB L/C) shall be treated
for all purposes as Facility LCs issued by the Bank under this Agreement.

2.2. Determination of Dollar Amounts; Required Payments; Termination.
(a) The Bank will determine the Dollar Amount of each Advance as of the date
three Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date or, if applicable, date of
conversion or continuation of the Advance, and on any other Business Day elected
by the Bank in its discretion (each a "Computation Date").

(b)      The Outstanding Credit Exposure and all other unpaid
Obligations shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the
Facility Termination Date.

(c)      The Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid when due (i) all
regularly scheduled principal payments on the Outstanding
Facilities and (ii) all payments of interest and fees
(including without limitation amendment fees, letter of credit
fees, and commitment fees) which are owing under the
Outstanding Facilities.

2.3.     Reserved.

2.4.     Types of Advances. The Advances may be Floating Rate Advances
or Eurocurrency Advances, or a combination thereof, selected
by the Borrower in accordance with Sections 2.8 and 2.9.
<PAGE>
2.5.     Fees; Reductions in Commitment.

(a)      Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank a
commitment fee at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable
Margin on the daily unused amount of the Commitment from the
Effective Date to and including the Facility Termination Date,
payable quarterly in arrears and on the Facility Termination
Date. The commitment fee for each fiscal quarter of the
Borrower shall be due and payable within ten (10) days after
the Bank submits a statement to the Borrower of the amount due
for such fiscal quarter, based on the Bank's determination of
the Applicable Margin for such fiscal quarter. For purposes of
calculating the commitment fee hereunder, the principal amount
of each Advance made in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars
shall be the Dollar Amount of such Advance as determined on
the most recent Computation Date with respect to such Advance.

(b)      LC Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank (i) with respect
to each standby Facility LC, a letter of credit fee at a per
annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency
Advances in effect from time to time on the average daily
undrawn stated amount under such standby Facility LC, subject
to the Bank's standard minimum fee existing at the time of
issuance, such fee to be payable in advance on each Payment
Date, and (ii) with respect to each commercial Facility LC, a
one-time letter of credit fee at times and in amounts as the
Borrower and the Bank may agree from time to time (each such
fee described in this sentence, an "LC Fee"). The Borrower
shall also pay to the Bank at the time each Facility LC is
issued documentary and processing charges in connection with
the issuance or Modification of and draws under Facility LCs
in accordance with the Bank's standard schedule for such
charges as in effect from time to time.

(c)      Optional Reductions in Commitment. From time to time, the
Borrower may permanently reduce the Commitment in a minimum
amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of $500,000 (or
the Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed
Currency other than Dollars), upon written notice to the Bank,
which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction,
provided, however, that the amount of the Commitment may not
be reduced below the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of the
Outstanding Credit Exposure.

(d)      Mandatory Prepayments. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if at any time the aggregate Dollar
Amount of the Outstanding Credit Exposure (calculated, with
respect to those Advances denominated in Agreed Currencies
other than Dollars, as of the most recent Computation Date
with respect to each such Advance) exceeds the lesser of the
Borrowing Base or the Commitment, and upon written notice from
the Bank of such occurrence, the Borrower shall immediately
repay Advances in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to
eliminate any such excess, to be applied first to amounts
outstanding under the Loan, and then to the Facility LC
Collateral Account.
<PAGE>
2.6.     Minimum Amount of Each Advance. Each Eurocurrency Advance
shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 and in multiples
of $100,000 if in excess thereof (or the Approximate
Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed Currency other
than Dollars), and each Floating Rate Advance shall be in the
minimum amount of $100,000 and in multiples of $10,000 if in
excess thereof, provided, any Floating Rate Advance may be in
the amount of the unused Commitment.

2.7.     Optional Principal Payments. The Borrower may from time to
time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating
Rate Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $100,000
or any integral multiple of $10,000 in excess thereof, any
portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances. The
Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of
any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4
but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurocurrency
Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or
any integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or the
Approximate Equivalent Amount if denominated in an Agreed
Currency other than Dollars), any portion of the outstanding
Eurocurrency Advances upon three Business Days' prior notice
to the Bank.

2.8.     Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New
Advances. The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and,
in the case of each Eurocurrency Advance, the Interest Period
and Agreed Curency applicable thereto from time to time. The
Borrower shall give the Bank irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing
Notice") not later than Noon (Chicago time) on the Borrowing
Date of each Floating Rate Advance and three Business Days
before the Borrowing Date for each Eurocurrency Advance,
specifying:

(i)      the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
Advance,

(ii)     the aggregate amount of such Advance,

(iii)    the Type of Advance selected, and

(iv)     in the case of each Eurocurrency Advance, the Interest Period
and Agreed Currency applicable thereto.

2.9.     Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating
Rate Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless
and until such Floating Rate Advances are converted into
Eurocurrency Advances pursuant to this Section 2.9 or are
repaid in accordance with Section 2.7. Each Eurocurrency
Advance shall continue as a Eurocurrency Advance until the end
of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which
time:

(i) each such Eurocurrency Advance denominated in Dollars
shall be automatically converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless (x) such
Eurocurrency Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (y) the
Borrower shall have given the Bank a Conversion/Continuation Notice requesting
that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Advance either
continue as a Eurocurrency Advance for the same or another Interest Period or be
converted into a Floating Rate Advance; and
<PAGE>

(ii) each such Eurocurrency Advance denominated in an Agreed
Currency other than Dollars shall automatically continue as a Eurocurrency
Advance in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month unless
(x) such Eurocurrency Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or
(y) the Borrower shall have given the Bank a Conversion/Continuation Notice
requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurocurrency Advance
continue as a Eurocurrency Advance for the same or another Interest Period.

Subject to the terms of Section 2.6, the Borrower may elect from time
to time to convert all or any part of a Floating Rate Advance into a
Eurocurrency Advance denominated in the same or any other Agreed Currency,
provided, that any conversion of any Eurocurrency Advance shall be made only on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. The Borrower shall give
the Bank irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation Notice") of each
conversion of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurocurrency Advance or
continuation of a Eurocurrency Advance not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time)
at least three Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or
continuation, specifying:

(i)      the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
conversion or continuation,

(ii)     the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be
converted or continued, and,

(iii)    the Agreed Currency, amount of such Advance which is to be
converted into or continued as a Eurocurrency Advance and the
duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

2.10.    Changes in Interest Rate, etc. Each Floating Rate Advance
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance
is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Advance into a
Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but
excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a
Eurocurrency Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate
per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day. Changes in
the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained
as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously
with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurocurrency
Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof from and including the first day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the
last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate
determined by the Bank as applicable to such Eurocurrency
Advance based upon the Borrower's selections under Sections
2.8 and 2.9 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof.
No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination
Date.
<PAGE>
2.11.    Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, during the
continuance of a Default or Unmatured Default the Bank may, at
its option, by notice to the Borrower, declare that no Advance
may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurocurrency
Advance. During the continuance of a Default the Bank may, at
its option, by notice to the Borrower, declare that (i) each
Eurocurrency Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of
the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise
applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum, (ii)
each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time to time
plus 2% per annum and (iii) the LC Fee shall be increased by
2% per annum, provided that, during the continuance of a
Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth
in clauses (i) and (ii) above and the increase in the LC Fee
set forth in clause (iii) above shall be applicable to all
Credit Extensions without any election or action on the part
of the Bank.

2.12.    Method of Payment. (a) Each Advance shall be repaid and each
payment of interest thereon shall be paid in the currency in
which such
Advance was made. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made,
without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to
the Bank at the Bank's address specified pursuant to Article XII, or at any
other Lending Installation of the Bank specified in writing by the Bank to the
Borrower, by noon (Chicago time) on the date when due and shall (except in the
case of Reimbursement Obligations for which the Bank has not been fully
indemnified, or as otherwise specifically required hereunder) be applied by the
Bank as it may determine in its sole discretion. The Bank is authorized to
charge any account of the Borrower maintained with the Bank or any of its
Affiliates for each payment of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligations
and fees as it becomes due hereunder.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after
the making of any Advance in any currency other than Dollars, currency control
or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency
with the result that the type of currency in which the Advance was made (the
"Original Currency") no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make
payment to the Bank in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by
the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in
Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of
such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower
take all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange
regulations.

2.13. Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness. (i) The Bank shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing
the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Bank resulting from each Advance made by
the Bank from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to the Bank from time to time hereunder.
<PAGE>
(ii) The Bank shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (a)
the amount of each Advance made hereunder, the Agreed Currency and Type thereof
and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (b) the amount
of any  principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from
the Borrower to the Bank  hereunder,  (c) the original  stated amount of each
Facility LC and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time, and (d)
the amount of any sum received by the Bank hereunder from the Borrower.

(iii) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure
of the Bank to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any
manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in
accordance with their terms.

(iv) The Bank may request that its Loan be evidenced by a promissory
note (a "Note"). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
to the Bank a Note payable to the order of the Bank in a form supplied by the
Bank. Thereafter, the Advances evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall
at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 11.3) be
represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein
or any assignee pursuant to Section 11.3, except to the extent that the Bank or
assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that
the Loan once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.

2.14. Telephonic Notices. The Borrower authorizes the Bank to extend,
convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Agreed Currencies and Types
of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person
or persons the Bank in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the
Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically
intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be
given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Bank a
written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Bank, of each
telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation
differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Bank, the records
of the Bank shall govern absent manifest error.

2.15. Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued
on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof and at maturity.
Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance shall be payable on the last day
of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurocurrency Advance
is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest
accrued on each Eurocurrency Advance having an Interest Period longer than three
months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during
such Interest Period. Interest and LC Fees shall be calculated for actual days
elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year, except for interest on Loans denominated
in British Pounds Sterling, which shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on
the basis of a 365-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is
made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is
received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of
principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day
and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be
included in computing interest in connection with such payment.
<PAGE>
2.16. Lending Installations. The Bank may book its Loans and the
Facility LCs at the appropriate Lending Installation listed on Schedule 2 or
such other Lending Installation designated by the Bank in accordance with the
final sentence of this Section 2.16. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to
any such Lending Installation and the Loan, Facility LCs, and any Note issued
hereunder shall be deemed held by the Bank for the benefit of any such Lending
Installation. The Bank may, by written notice to the Borrower, designate
replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Advances will be
made by it or Facility LCs will be issued by it and for whose account Loan
payments or payments with respect to Facility LCs are to be made.

2.17. Reserved.

2.18. Facility LCs.

2.18.1. Issuance.

(a) The Bank agrees, on the terms set forth in this Agreement, to issue
standby and commercial letters of credit (each, a "Facility LC" ) and to renew,
extend, increase, decrease or otherwise modify each Facility LC ("Modify" and
each such action a "Modification"), from time to time from and including the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Facility Termination Date upon the
request of the Borrower; provided that immediately after each such Facility LC
is issued or Modified, (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding LC
Obligations shall not exceed the Commitment, and (ii) the Outstanding Credit
Exposure shall not exceed the Commitment. No Facility LC shall have an expiry
date later than the earlier of (x) the fifth Business Day prior to the Facility
Termination Date and (y) one year after its issuance.

2.18.2. Notice. Subject to Section 2.18.1, the Borrower shall give the
Bank notice prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least five Business Days prior
to the proposed date of issuance or Modification of each Facility LC specifying
the beneficiary, the proposed date of issuance (or Modification) and the expiry
date of such Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such Facility LC
and the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby. The
issuance or Modification by the Bank of any Facility LC shall, in addition to
the conditions precedent set forth in Article IV (the satisfaction of which the
Bank shall have no duty to ascertain), be subject to the conditions precedent
that such Facility LC shall be satisfactory to the Bank and that the Borrower
shall have executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other
instruments and agreements relating to such Facility LC as the Bank shall have
reasonably requested (each, a "Facility LC Application"). In the event of any
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC
Application, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

2.18.3. Administration; Reimbursement by the Bank . Upon
receipt from the beneficiary of any Facility LC of any demand for payment under
such Facility LC, the Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower as to the amount
to be paid by the Bank as a result of such demand and the proposed payment date
(the "LC Payment Date"). The responsibility of the Bank to the Borrower shall be
only to determine that the documents (including each demand for payment)
delivered under each Facility LC in connection with such presentment shall be in
conformity in all material respects with such Facility LC. The Bank shall
endeavor to exercise the same care in the issuance and administration of the
Facility LCs as it does with respect to letters of credit in which no
participations are granted.
<PAGE>
2.18.4. Reimbursement by the Borrower. The Borrower shall be
irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the Bank on or before the
applicable LC Payment Date for any amounts to be paid by the Bank upon any
drawing under any Facility LC, without presentment, demand, protest or other
formalities of any kind; provided that the Borrower shall not be precluded from
asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered by the
Borrower to the extent, but only to the extent, caused by (i) the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of the Bank in determining whether a request
presented under any Facility LC issued by it complied with the terms of such
Facility LC or (ii) the Bank's failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it
after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of such Facility LC. All such amounts paid by the Bank and remaining
unpaid by the Borrower shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day
until paid at a rate per annum equal to (x) the rate applicable to Floating Rate
Advances for such day if such day falls on or before the applicable LC Payment
Date and (y) the sum of 2% plus the rate applicable to Floating Rate Advances
for such day if such day falls after such LC Payment Date. Subject to the terms
of this Agreement (including without limitation the submission of a Borrowing
Notice in compliance with Section 2.8 and the satisfaction of the applicable
conditions precedent set forth in Article IV), the Borrower may request an
Advance hereunder for the purpose of satisfying any Reimbursement Obligation.

2.18.5. Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligations under
this Section 2.18 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment
which the Borrower may have or have had against the Bank or any beneficiary of a
Facility LC. The Borrower further agrees with the Bank that the Bank shall not
be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement Obligation in respect of
any Facility LC shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or
genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents
should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or forged,
or any dispute between or among the Borrower, any of its Affiliates, the
beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing institution or other party to
whom any Facility LC may be transferred or any claims or defenses whatsoever of
the Borrower or of any of its Affiliates against the beneficiary of any Facility
LC or any such transferee. The Bank shall not be liable for any error, omission,
interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or
advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility LC. The Borrower
agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Bank under or in connection with
each Facility LC and the related drafts and documents, if done without gross
negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall
not put the Bank under any liability to the Borrower. Nothing in this Section
2.18.5 is intended to limit the right of the Borrower to make a claim against
the Bank for damages as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of
Section 2.18.4.

2.18.6. Actions of the Bank. The Bank shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Facility LC, draft,
writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other
document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent
or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal
counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Bank. The
Bank shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement unless it shall first have received such advice as it reasonably
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable
satisfaction against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by
it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
<PAGE>
2.18.7. Indemnification. The Borrower indemnifies and holds
harmless the Bank, and its directors, officers, agents and employees from and
against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses
which the Bank may incur (or which may be claimed against the Bank by any Person
whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance, execution and
delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any Facility LC or
any actual or proposed use of any Facility LC, including, without limitation,
any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which the Bank may
incur by reason of or in connection with, by reason of or on account of the Bank
issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term "Beneficiary" included
therein includes any successor by operation of law of the named Beneficiary, but
which Facility LC does not require that any drawing by any such successor
Beneficiary be accompanied by a copy of a legal document, satisfactory to the
Bank, evidencing the appointment of such successor Beneficiary; provided that
the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify the Bank for any claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the
extent, caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Bank in
determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC complied with the
terms of such Facility LC or (y) the Bank's failure to pay under any Facility LC
after the presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of such Facility LC. Nothing in this Section 2.18.7 is intended to
limit the obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this
Agreement.

2.18.8. Facility LC Collateral Account. The Borrower agrees
that it will, upon the request of the Bank and until the final expiration date
of any Facility LC and thereafter as long as any amount is payable to the Bank
in respect of any Facility LC, maintain a special collateral
account pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Bank (the "Facility LC
Collateral Account") at the Bank's office at the address specified pursuant to
Article XII, in the name of such Borrower but under the sole dominion and
control of the Bank and in which such Borrower shall have no interest other than
as set forth in Section 8.1. The Borrower pledges, assigns and grants to the
Bank, a security interest in all of the Borrower's right, title and interest in
and to all funds which may from time to time be on deposit in the Facility LC
Collateral Account to secure the prompt and complete payment and performance of
the Obligations. The Bank will invest any funds on deposit from time to time in
the Facility LC Collateral Account in certificates of deposit of the Bank having
a maturity not exceeding 30 days. Nothing in this Section 2.18.8 shall either
obligate the Bank to require the Borrower to deposit any funds in the Facility
LC Collateral Account or limit the right of the Bank to release any funds held
in the Facility LC Collateral Account in each case other than as required by
Section 8.1.

2.19 Borrowing Base Adjustments. The Borrower agrees that if at any
time any trade account receivable or any inventory of the Borrower fails to
constitute Eligible Finished Goods Inventory, Eligible Trade Receivables,
Eligible Extended Receivables, or Eligible Inventory, as the case may be, for
any reason, the Bank may, at any time and notwithstanding any prior
classification of eligibility, classify such asset as ineligible and exclude the
same from the computation of the Borrowing Base without in any way impairing the
rights of the Bank in and to the same under the Collateral Documents.

2.20 Security and Collateral. To secure the payment when due of any
Note and the other Obligations to the Bank, the Borrower and the Guarantors
shall each execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the
Bank (to the extent not previously executed and delivered) Collateral Documents
granting the following:
<PAGE>
(a) Security interests in all present and future
accounts, inventory, equipment, general intangibles, investment property,
deposit accounts, fixtures, and all other personal property of the Borrower
other than property held in the trust existing pursuant to the Hurco Deferred
Compensation Plan Trust Agreement in connection with the Hurco Deferred
Compensation Plan.

(b) Pledges of 100% of the Capital Stock of all
Domestic  Subsidiaries (excluding the Guarantors and all Inactive Subsidiaries),
plus a pledge of 66% of the Capital Stock of Hurco International, Inc., and
Hurco International Holdings, Inc.

(c) Guarantees of the Guarantors under the Guaranty.

(d) All other security and collateral described in
the Collateral Documents.

2.21. Market Disruption. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all
conditions referred to in Article II and Article IV with respect to any Advance
in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to
the date of such Advance any change in national or international financial,
political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls
which would in the reasonable opinion of the Bank make it impracticable for any
Eurocurrency Advances to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the
Borrower, then the Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower, and
such Eurocurrency Advances shall not be denominated in such Agreed Currency but
shall be made on such Borrowing Date in Dollars, in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in
the related Borrowing Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may
be, as Floating Rate Advances, unless the Borrower notifies the Bank at least
one Business Day before such date that (i) it elects not to borrow on such date
or (ii) it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, as the
case may be, in which the denomination of such Advances would in the opinion of
the Bank be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar
Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Borrowing
Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be.

2.22. Judgment Currency. If for the purposes of obtaining
judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower
hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "specified
currency") into another currency, the parties agree that the rate of exchange
used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Bank could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the
Bank's main Chicago office on the Business Day preceding that on which final,
non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrower in respect of
any sum due to the Bank shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other
than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the
Business Day following receipt by the Bank of any sum adjudged to be so due in
such other currency the Bank may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking
procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the
amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally
due to the Bank in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest
extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Bank against such loss, and
if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally
due to the Bank in the specified currency, the Bank agrees to remit such excess
to the Borrower.

ARTICLE III

YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

3.1. Yield Protection. In the event that any applicable law, treaty or
other international agreement, rule, or regulation (whether domestic or foreign)
now or hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to the Bank
or applicable Lending Installation, or any interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank or applicable Lending
Installation with any guideline, request or directive of any such authority
(whether or not having the force of law), shall (a) affect the basis of taxation
of payments to the Bank of any amounts payable by the Borrower under this
Agreement (other than Excluded Taxes), or (b) shall impose, modify or deem
applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by the Bank or
applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into
account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Advances),
or (c) shall impose any other condition with respect to this Agreement, the
Commitment, any Note, or the Loan, or any Facility LC (including without
limitation converting any Eurocurrency Advance denominated in an Agreed Currency
other than the Euro into a Eurocurrency Advance denominated in the Euro), and
the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Bank or
applicable Lending Installation of making, funding, or maintaining any
Eurocurrency Advance or any Facility LC or to reduce the amount of any sum
receivable by the Bank or applicable Lending Installation thereon, then the
Borrower shall pay to the Bank, from time to time, upon its request, additional
amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank for such increased cost or reduced sum
receivable. A statement as to the amount of such increased cost or reduced sum
receivable, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by the Bank and
submitted by the Bank to the Borrower, shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes absent manifest error in computation.

3.2. Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. In the event that any
applicable law, treaty, or other international agreement, rule, or regulation
(whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether or not
presently applicable to the Bank, or any interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank with any guideline, request or
directive of any such authority (whether or not having the force of law),
including any risk-based capital guidelines, affects or would affect the amount
of capital required or expected to be maintained by the Bank (or any corporation
controlling the Bank) and the Bank determines that the amount of such capital is
increased by or based upon the existence of the Bank's obligations hereunder and
such increase has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Bank's (or
such controlling corporation's) capital as a consequence of such obligations
hereunder to a level below that which the Bank (or such controlling corporation)
could have achieved but for such circumstances (taking into consideration its
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then the Borrower shall pay to the
Bank from time to time, upon request by the Bank, additional amounts sufficient
to compensate such Bank (or such controlling corporation) for any increase in
the amount of capital and reduced rate of return which the Bank reasonably
determines to be allocable to the existence of the Bank's obligations hereunder.
A statement as to the amount of such compensation, prepared in good faith and in
reasonable detail by the Bank and submitted to the Borrower, shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.
<PAGE>
3.3. Availability of Types of Advances. In the event that any
applicable law, treaty, or other international agreement, rule, or regulation
(whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether or not
presently applicable to the Bank, or any interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank with any guideline, request,
or directive of such authority (whether or not having the force of law),
including without limitation exchange controls, shall make it unlawful or
impossible for the Bank to maintain any Eurocurrency Advance at a suitable
Lending Installation under this Agreement, shall make it impracticable, unlawful
or impossible for, or shall in any way limit or impair ability of, the Borrower
to make or the Bank to receive any payment under this Agreement at the place
specified for payment hereunder, the Bank shall suspend the availability of
Eurocurrency Advances and the Borrower shall, upon receiving notice thereof from
the Bank, repay in full the then-outstanding principal amount of each
Eurocurrency Advance so affected, together with all accrued interest thereon to
the date of payment and all amounts owing to the Bank under Section 3.4, (a) on
the last day of the then-current Interest Period applicable to the Eurocurrency
Advance if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain the Eurocurrency Advance
to that day, or (b) immediately if the Bank may not continue to maintain the
Eurocurrency Advance to that day.

3.4. Funding Indemnification. If the Borrower makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Eurocurrency Advance on any other date than the
last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (whether pursuant to Section
2.2, Section 2.5, Section 2.7, Section 8.1, or otherwise), or if the Borrower
fails to borrow any Eurocurrency Advance after notice has been given to the Bank
in accordance with Section 2.8, or if the Borrower fails to make any payment of
principal or interest in respect of a Eurocurrency Advance when due, the
Borrower shall reimburse the Bank on demand for any resulting loss or expense
incurred by the Bank, including without limitation any loss incurred in
obtaining, liquidating, or employing deposits from third parties, whether or not
the Bank shall have funded or committed to fund the Eurocurrency Advance. A
statement as to the amount of such loss or expense, prepared in good faith and
in reasonable detail by the Bank and submitted by the Bank to the Borrower,
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in
computation. Calculation of all amounts payable to the Bank under this Section
3.4 shall be made as though the Bank shall have actually funded or committed to
fund the relevant Eurocurrency Advance through the purchase of an underlying
deposit in an amount equal to the amount of the Eurocurrency Advance in the
relevant market and having a maturity comparable to the related Interest Period
and through the transfer of such deposit to a domestic office of the Bank in the
United States; provided, however, that the Bank may fund any Eurocurrency
Advance in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized
only for the purpose of calculating amounts payable under this Section 3.4.

3.5. Taxes. (i) All payments of principal of and interest on the Loan
and other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be made by the
Borrower without setoff or counterclaim, and, subject to the next succeeding
sentence, free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are imposed, the Borrower will pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary so that payment of principal of and
interest on the Loan and other amounts payable hereunder, after withholding or
deduction for or on account thereof, will not be less than any amount provided
to be paid hereunder and, in any such case, the Borrower will furnish to the
Bank certified copies of all tax receipts evidencing the payment of such amounts
within 45 days after the date any such payment is due pursuant to applicable
law.
<PAGE>
(ii) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or
Facility LC Application or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement or any Note or Facility LC Application ("Other
Taxes").

(iii) The Borrower indemnifies the Bank for the full amount of Taxes or
Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on
amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Bank and any liability
(including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto. Payments due under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days of
the date the Bank makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

3.6. Bank Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
possible, the Bank shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurocurrency Advances to reduce any liability of the Borrower to
the Bank under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurocurrency Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in
the judgment of the Bank, disadvantageous to it. The Bank shall deliver a
written statement to the Borrower as to the amount due, if any, under Section
3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable
detail the calculations upon which the Bank determined such amount and shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.
Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a
Eurocurrency Advances shall be calculated as though the Bank funded its
Eurocurrency Advances through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity
corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurocurrency
Rate applicable to such Credit Extension, whether in fact that is the case or
not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written
statement of the Bank shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower
of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1,
3.2, 3.4, and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
this Agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Borrower represents and warrants to the Bank that:

corporate power to own or lease the properties used in its business and to carry
on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted.

5.2. Authorization and Validity. The Borrower and each Guarantor, as
the case may be, has the power and authority and legal right to execute and
deliver the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations
thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Borrower and each of the
Guarantors, as the case may be, of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and
the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by
proper corporate proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which the Borrower and
each of the Guarantors is a party, as the case may be, constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Borrower and each of the Guarantors, as the case
may be, enforceable against the Borrower or each Guarantor, as the case may be,
in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally.

5.3. No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower or the Guarantors of the Loan Documents to which it is
a party, nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor
compliance with the provisions thereof will violate (i) any law, rule,
regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's
articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of
partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating or
other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any
indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is
bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or
require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the
Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument
or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization,
or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or
other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any

Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents, the borrowings under this Agreement, the payment and performance by
the Borrower of the Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or

5.4. Financial Statements. The September 30, 2003, consolidated
financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries heretofore delivered
to the Bank were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly
present the consolidated financial condition and operations of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of their operations
for the period then ended.
<PAGE>
5.5. Material Adverse Change. Since September 30, 2003, there has been
no change in the business, Property, prospects, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which

5.6. Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be
filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any
assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except such
taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate
reserves have been provided in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles
and as to which no Lien exists. No tax liens have been filed and no claims are
being asserted with respect to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any
taxes or other governmental charges are adequate.

5.7. Litigation and Contingent Obligations. There is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of
any Credit Extensions. Other than any liability incident to any litigation,
arbitration or proceeding which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower has no material contingent obligations not
provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section
5.4.

5.8. Subsidiaries. Schedule 5.8 contains an accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth
their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
respective Capital Stock or other ownership interests owned by the Borrower or
other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock or
other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such
concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests) duly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. Each Subsidiary of the
Borrower has and will have all requisite corporate power to own or lease the
properties used in its business and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and as proposed to be conducted.

5.9. ERISA. There are no Unfunded Liabilities of any Single Employer
Plans of the Borrower or the Guarantors. Neither the Borrower nor any other
member of the Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur,
any withdrawal liability to Multiemployer Plans. Each Plan complies in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of law and regulations, no
Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan, neither the Borrower nor
any other member of the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any Plan or
initiated steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to reorganize or
terminate any Plan.

5.10. Accuracy of Information. No information, exhibit or report
furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Bank in connection
with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan Documents contained any
material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact or any fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

5.11. Regulation U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U)
constitutes less than 25% of the value of those assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other
restriction hereunder.
<PAGE>
5.12. Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in (i) any agreement to which it is a party, which default
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any
agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness.

5.13. Compliance With Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or
agency thereof having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective
businesses or the ownership of their respective Property.

5.14. Ownership of Properties. On the date of this Agreement, the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries will have good title, free of all Liens other than
those permitted by Section 6.15, to all of the Property and assets reflected in
the Borrower's most recent consolidated financial statements provided to the
Bank as owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

5.15. Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions. The Borrower is not an
entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss.
2510.3-101 of an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
which is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of
Credit Extensions hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

5.16. Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of its business,
the officers of the Borrower consider the effect of Environmental Laws on the
business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which they
identify and evaluate potential risks and liabilities accruing to the Borrower
due to Environmental Laws. On the basis of this consideration, the Borrower and
each of its Subsidiaries has concluded that Environmental Laws cannot reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary has received any notice to the effect that its operations are not in
material compliance with any of the requirements of applicable Environmental
Laws or are the subject of any federal or state investigation evaluating whether
any remedial action is needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous
waste or substance into the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.17. Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

5.18. Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding

Act of 1935, as amended.

Financial Officer of the Borrower, that attests to the existence and adequacy
of, and summarizes, the property and casualty insurance program carried by the
Borrower with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries and that has been furnished
by the Borrower to the Bank, is complete and accurate. This summary includes the
insurer's or insurers' name(s), policy number(s), expiration date(s), amount(s)
of coverage, type(s) of coverage, exclusion(s), and deductibles. This summary
also includes similar information, and describes any reserves, relating to any
self-insurance program that is in effect.

5.20 Borrowing Base. All accounts receivable and inventory of the
Borrower represented or reported by the Borrower to be, or are otherwise
included in, Eligible Finished Goods Inventory, Eligible Trade Receivables,
Eligible Extended Receivables, and Eligible Inventory comply in all respects as
of the date reported with the requirements therefor set forth in the definition
thereof, and the computation of the Borrowing Base set forth in each Borrowing
Base Certificate is true and correct.

5.21 Disclosure. No report or other information furnished in writing or
on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor to the Bank in connection with the
negotiation or administration of this Agreement contains any material
misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact or any fact necessary
to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances in which they were made. Neither this Agreement, or the Notes, the
Collateral Documents nor any other document, certificate, or report or statement
or other information furnished to the Bank by or on behalf of the Borrower or
any Guarantor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact in order to make the statements contained herein and therein not misleading

the Business Plan, there is no fact known to the Borrower or any Guarantor which
materially and adversely affects, or which in the future may (so far as the
Borrower or any Guarantor can now foresee) materially and adversely affect, the
business, properties, operations or condition, financial or otherwise, of the
Borrower, any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries, which has not
been set forth in this Agreement or in the other documents, certificates,
statements, reports and other information furnished in writing to the Bank by or
on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

5.22 Intellectual Property. Set forth on Schedule 5.22 is a complete
and accurate list of all patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks and
copyrights, and all applications therefor and licenses thereof, of the Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries showing the jurisdiction in which registered, the
registration number and the date of registration. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, trade names, service
marks, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes necessary for the conduct
of its business as currently conducted (the "Intellectual Property") except for
those the failure to own or license which could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.22, no claim
has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the
use of any such Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any
such Intellectual Property, nor does the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
know of any valid basis for any such claim, the use of such Intellectual
Property by the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the
rights of any Person, and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, no Intellectual
Property has been infringed, misappropriated or diluted by any other Person
except for such claims, infringements, misappropriation and dilutions that, in
the aggregate, could not have a Material Adverse Effect.

LC Obligations at such time, less (y) the amount on deposit in the Facility LC
Collateral Account at such time which is free and clear of all rights and claims
of third parties and has not been applied against the Obligations (such
difference, the "Collateral Shortfall Amount"). If any other Default occurs, the
Bank may (a) terminate or suspend its obligations to make Advances hereunder and
its obligation and power to issue Facility LCs, or declare the Obligations to be
due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due
and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of
which the Borrower expressly waives, and (b) upon notice to the Borrower and in
addition to the continuing right to demand payment of all amounts payable under
this Agreement, make demand on the Borrower to pay, and the Borrower will,
forthwith upon such demand and without any further notice or act, pay to the
Bank the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be deposited in the
Facility LC Collateral Account.

(ii) If at any time while any Default is continuing, the Bank
determines that the Collateral Shortfall Amount at such time is greater than
zero, the Bank may make demand on the Borrower to pay, and the Borrower will,
forthwith upon such demand and without any further notice or act, pay to the
Bank the Collateral Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be deposited in the
Facility LC Collateral Account.

(iii) The Bank may at any time or from time to time after funds are
deposited in the Facility LC Collateral Account, apply such funds to the payment
of the Obligations and any other amounts as shall from time to time have become
due and payable by the Borrower to the Bank under the Loan Documents.

(iv) At any time while any Default is continuing, neither the Borrower
nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through the Borrower shall have any
right to withdraw any of the funds held in the Facility LC Collateral Account.
After all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the
Commitment has been terminated, any funds remaining in the Facility LC
Collateral Account shall be returned by the Bank to the Borrower or paid to
whomever may be legally entitled thereto at such time.

8.2. Amendments. The Bank and the Borrower may enter into agreements
supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the
Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Borrower hereunder or
waiving any Default hereunder.
<PAGE>

8.3. Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Bank to
exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the
inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Credit
Extension shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial
exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation
of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be
valid unless in writing signed by the Bank, and then only to the extent in such
writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or
by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Bank until
the Obligations have been paid in full.

ARTICLE IX

GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.1. Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties of
the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making of the Credit
Extensions herein contemplated.

9.2. Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Bank shall not be obligated to extend credit
to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

9.3. Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

9.4. Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the Borrower and the Bank and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings among the Borrower and the Bank relating to the
subject matter thereof.

9.5. Benefits of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be construed
so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.

9.6. Expenses; Indemnification. (i) The Borrower shall reimburse the
Bank for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable time charges of attorneys for the
Bank, which attorneys may be employees of the Bank) paid or incurred by the Bank
in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery,
distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet), review,
amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower
also agrees to reimburse the Bank for any costs, internal charges and
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable time
charges of attorneys for the Bank, which attorneys may be employees of the Bank)
paid or incurred by the Bank in connection with the collection and enforcement
of the Loan Documents. Expenses being reimbursed by the Borrower under this
Section include, without limitation, the cost and expense of obtaining an
appraisal of each parcel of real property or interest in real property described
in the Mortgage, which appraisal shall be in conformity with the applicable
requirements of any law or any governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline
or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any interpretation
thereof, including, without limitation, the provisions of Title XI of the
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended,
reformed or otherwise modified from time to time, and any rules promulgated to

behalf of the Borrower, after the Bank has exercised its rights of inspection
pursuant to this Agreement.

(ii) The Borrower further agrees to indemnify the Bank, its affiliates,
and each of its directors, officers and employees against all losses, claims,
damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor whether or not
the Bank or any Affiliate is a party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur
<PAGE>
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or
proposed application of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder except to
the extent that they are determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification. The obligations of the
Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

9.7. Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles, except that any calculation or determination which is to be made on
a consolidated basis shall be made for the Borrower and all its Subsidiaries,
including those Subsidiaries, if any, which are unconsolidated on the Borrower's
audited financial statements.

9.8. Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

9.9. Nonliability of the Bank. The relationship between the Borrower on
the one hand and the Bank on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and
lender. The Bank shall not have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower.
The Bank does not undertake any responsibility to the Borrower to review or
inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's
business or operations. The Borrower agrees that the Bank shall not have
liability to the Borrower (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for
losses suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any
way related to, the transactions contemplated and the relationship established
by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection
therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought. The Bank shall
not have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower waives, releases and
agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way
related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

9.10. Confidentiality. The Bank agrees to hold any confidential
information which it may receive from the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in
confidence, except for disclosure (i) to its Affiliates, (ii) to legal counsel,
accountants, and other professional advisors to such Affiliate or to a
Transferee, (iii) to regulatory officials, (iv) to any Person as requested
pursuant to or as required by law, regulation, or legal process, (v) to any
Person in connection with any legal proceeding to which such Affiliate is a
party, (vi) to such Affiliate's direct or indirect contractual counterparties in
swap agreements or to legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors
to such counterparties, and (vii) permitted by Section 11.4.

9.11. Disclosure. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Bank
and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold investments in, make other
loans to or have other relationships with the Borrower and its Affiliates.
<PAGE>

9.12. Construction of Certain Provisions.If any provision of this
Agreement refers to any action to be taken by any person, or which such person
is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such
action is taken directly or indirectly by such person, whether or not expressly
specified in such provision.

9.13. Independence of Covenants.All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted
by any such covenant, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or
would be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid
the occurrence of a Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

9.14. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement or the Notes, in no event shall the amount of interest paid or agreed
to be paid by the Borrower exceed an amount computed at the highest rate of
interest permissible under applicable law. If, from any circumstances
whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes at the
time performance of such provision shall be due shall involve exceeding the
interest rate limitation validly prescribed by law which a court of competent
jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then, ipso facto, the obligations to be
fulfilled shall be reduced to an amount computed at the highest rate of interest
permissible under applicable law. If for any reason whatsoever the Bank shall
ever receive as interest an amount which would be deemed unlawful under such
applicable law, the amount shall be automatically applied to the payment of
principal of the Advances outstanding hereunder (whether or not then due and
payable) and not to the payment of interest, or shall be refunded to the
Borrower if such principal and all other obligations of the Borrower to the Bank
have been paid in full.

9.15. USA Patriot Act Notification. The following notification is
provided to Borrower pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, 31
U.S.C. Section 5318:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To
help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain,
verify, and record information that identifies each person or entity
that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury
management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial
services product. What this means for Borrower: When Borrower opens an
account, Bank will ask for Borrower's name, tax identification number,
business address, and other information that will allow Bank to
identify Borrower. Bank may also ask to see Borrower's legal
organization documents or other identifying documents.

Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether
provisional or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Bank or any Affiliate of the Bank
to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied toward
the payment of the Secured Obligations owing to the Bank, whether or not the
Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due.

ARTICLE XI
BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

11.1. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, provided that the Borrower may not, without the prior written consent
of the Bank, assign its rights or obligations hereunder or under any Notes and
the Bank shall not be obligated to make any Advance hereunder to any entity
other than the Borrower.

11.2. Participations.

11.2.1. Permitted Participants; Effect. The Bank may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law,
at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities
("Participants") participating interests in any Outstanding Credit
Exposure of the Bank, any Note held by the Bank, any Commitment of the
Bank or any other interest of the Bank under the Loan Documents. In the
event of any such sale by the Bank of participating interests to a
Participant, the Bank's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
remain unchanged, the Bank shall remain solely responsible to the
Borrower for the performance of such obligations, the Bank shall remain
the owner of its Outstanding Credit Exposure and the holder of any Note
issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan
Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement
shall be determined as if the Bank had not sold such participating
interests, and the Borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly
with the Bank in connection with the Bank's rights and obligations
under the Loan Documents.

11.2.2. Voting Rights. Unless otherwise agreed between the
Bank and any Participant, the Bank shall retain the sole right to
approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents.

11.2.3. Benefit of Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in
Article 10 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing
under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as the Bank under the
Loan Documents, provided that the Bank shall retain the right of setoff
provided in Article 10 with respect to the amount of participating
interests sold to each Participant. The Bank agrees to share with each
Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff
provided in Article 10, agrees to share with the Bank, any amount
received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts
to be shared in accordance with their respective pro rata shares of the
Commitment or, if the Commitment is no longer available, in accordance
with their respective pro rata shares of the Outstanding Credit
Exposure.

11.3. Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes the Bank to
disclose to any Participant or any other Person acquiring an interest in the
Loan Documents by operation of law or otherwise (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in the Bank's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation any information contained in any Reports; provided that each
Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.10 of this
Agreement.

which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and either party hereto may

OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE
RIGHT OF THE BANK TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY

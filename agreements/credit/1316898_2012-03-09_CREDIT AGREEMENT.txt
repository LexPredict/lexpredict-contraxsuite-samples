AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE LOANS
2.1 Commitments.
(a) The Bank agrees, on the terms and conditions set
forth herein, to make loans (each, a “Revolving Loan,” and collectively, the “Revolving Loans”) to the Borrower, from time to time before the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided that, immediately after each
Revolving Loan is made, the Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed $6,000,000.00 (as such figure may be reduced from time to time as provided in this Agreement, the “Revolving Credit Commitment”). Subject to
Section 3.2, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.1(a), repay or prepay Revolving Loans and reborrow under this Section 2.1(a) at any time before the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

2.2 Notes. The Revolving Loans made by the Bank shall be evidenced by a Revolving Note payable to the order of the Bank for the
account of its Lending Office in an amount equal to the original principal amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment. The Borrower and the Bank hereby agree that the terms of this Agreement shall be incorporated by reference into the Notes as if set
forth therein and, in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Notes, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
2.3 Principal Payments; Maturity of Loans. The Borrower shall repay the Revolving Loans:
(i) In full, on the Revolving Credit Termination Date;
(ii) In
full, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and acceleration of the Obligations by the Bank pursuant to Article VIII hereof; and


11









(iii) In part, immediately in the event that the Revolving Credit Exposure
exceeds the Revolving Credit Commitment, in the amount of such excess; provided that, to the extent such excess amount is greater than the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding immediately prior to the application of
such repayment, the amount so repaid shall be retained by the Bank and held as cash collateral for outstanding Letters of Credit, Cash Management Products Exposure and Commercial Credit Card Exposure, and thereupon such cash shall be deemed to
reduce the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure by an equivalent amount.
2.4 Letters of Credit.

(a) Issuance. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, so long as no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Bank will, at any time and from time to time on and after the Closing Date and prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, and upon request by the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.2, issue for the account of the Borrower under the Revolving Credit Commitment one or more irrevocable standby letters of credit denominated in Dollars and in a form customarily used or otherwise approved by the Bank
(collectively with the Existing Letters of Credit, and, in each case, with all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto, substitutions therefor and renewals and restatements thereof, the “Letters of Credit”). The
Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall not be less than $25,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(i)
No Letter of Credit shall be issued if the Stated Amount upon issuance when added to the Revolving Credit Exposure, would exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitment at such time;

(ii) No Letter of Credit shall be issued that by its terms expires later than the date one year following the Revolving
Credit Termination Date or, in any event, more than one year after its date of issuance; provided, however, that all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the Revolving Credit Termination date shall be cash collateralized by the
Borrower; provided further that a Letter of Credit may, if requested by the Borrower, provide by its terms, and on terms acceptable to the Bank, for renewal for successive periods of one year or less (but not beyond the date one year
following the Revolving Credit Termination Date), unless and until the Bank shall have delivered a notice of nonrenewal to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit; and

(iii) The Bank shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, at the time of such proposed issuance, any
order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain the Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law applicable to the Bank or any request or directive (whether
or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose
upon the Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which the Bank is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the Closing Date, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not
applicable, in effect or known to the Bank as of the Closing Date and that the Bank in good faith deems material to it.
(b)
Notices. Whenever the Borrower desires the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower will give the Bank written notice not later than 12:00 noon, Charlotte, North Carolina time, three Business Days (or such shorter period as is
acceptable to the Bank in any given case) prior to the requested date of issuance thereof. Each such notice (each, a “Letter of Credit Notice”) shall be irrevocable, shall be given in the form of Exhibit D and shall
specify (i) the requested date of issuance, which shall be a Business Day, (ii) the requested Stated Amount and expiry date of the Letter of Credit, and (iii) the name and


12










address of the requested beneficiary or beneficiaries of the Letter of Credit. The Borrower will also complete any application procedures and documents reasonably required by the Bank in
connection with the issuance of any Letter of Credit.
(c) Reimbursement. Each drawing paid under a Letter of
Credit shall be deemed a Revolving Loan under the Revolving Credit Commitment and shall be repaid by the Borrower in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to Revolving Loans; provided however, that if advances under
the Revolving Commitments are not available, for any reason, at the time any drawing is paid, then the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Bank the full amount drawn, together with interest thereon from the date such drawing is paid to the date
such amount is fully repaid by the Borrower, at the rate of interest applicable to Revolving Loans.
(d) Existing Letters
of Credit. The Borrower and the Bank agree that, on and as of the Closing Date, each Existing Letter of Credit will be deemed continued under this Agreement as a Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Section 2.4.

(e) Obligations Absolute. Notwithstanding the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment or repayment of the Loans, or
both, the obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.4 shall be irrevocable, shall remain in effect until the Bank shall have no further obligations to make any payments or disbursements under any circumstances with respect to any
Letter of Credit, and shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be subject to counterclaim, setoff or other defense or any other qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement under all circumstances, including any of the following circumstances:
(i) Any lack of validity or
enforceability of this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any documents or instruments relating to any Letter of Credit;

any consent to departure from any Letter of Credit or any documents or instruments relating thereto, in each case whether or not such Borrower has notice or knowledge thereof;

(iii) The existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that such Borrower may have at any time against a
beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Bank or other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions
contemplated hereby or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between the Borrower and the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);

(iv) Any draft, certificate or any other document presented under the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect (provided that such draft, certificate or other document appears on its face to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), any errors,
omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, telecopier or otherwise, or any errors in translation or in interpretation of technical terms;

(v) Any defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of the Letter of
Credit (provided that any draft, certificate or other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit appears on its face to comply with the terms thereof), any nonapplication or misapplication by the beneficiary or any transferee of the
proceeds of such


13










drawing or any other act or omission of such beneficiary or transferee in connection with such Letter of Credit;

(vi) The exchange, release, surrender or impairment of any collateral or other security for the Obligations;

(vii) The occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; or

(viii) Any other circumstance or event whatsoever, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a
defense available to, or a discharge of, such Borrower or any Guarantor.
Any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Bank under or in
connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not create or result in any liability of the Bank to the Borrower. It is expressly
understood and agreed that, for purposes of determining whether a wrongful payment under a Letter of Credit resulted from the Bank’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, (i) the Bank’s acceptance of documents that appear on their
face to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, (ii) the Bank’s exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under
such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or
not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect (so long as such document appears on its face to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), and whether or not any other statement or any
other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever, and (iii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the
documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Bank.

(c) Interest on the Loans and fees shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

to be paid hereunder and under the Notes shall be automatically reduced to the maximum rate permitted by governing law and any


14










amounts collected in excess of the permissible amount shall be deemed a prepayment of principal on the Notes.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, upon and during the continuance of any Event of Default under this Agreement, at the option of the Bank without any required

such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (c), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection (c) the
payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This
paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

(d) Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.11 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a
Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Credit Document.
2.12 Increased Cost and Reduced Return.
(a) If the Bank shall have
determined that after the date hereof, any Change of Law, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) by any Governmental Authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Bank’s capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which the Bank could have achieved but
for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the Bank’s policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by the Bank to be material, then from time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by the
Bank, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such reduction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this provision shall not apply to a Change of Law, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof with respect to Taxes that (i) are subject to indemnification by the Credit Parties pursuant to Section 2.12 or (ii) are Excluded Taxes.

(b) The Bank will promptly notify the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle the Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of the Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to the Bank. A certificate of the Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such
amount, the Bank may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

(c) The provisions of this Section 2.12 shall be applicable with respect to any
participant, assignee or other transferee, and any calculations required by such provisions shall be made based upon the circumstances of such participant, assignee or other transferee.

the Bank agrees, on the terms and conditions and relying upon the
representations herein set forth, to issue additional standby or commercial

place designated by the Borrower in advance) on the date specified in the
Borrowing Request. The Borrower shall, by its execution hereof and its

been satisfied.

Section 2.04. Conversions and Continuances. The Borrower shall have
the option to convert on any Business Day all or a portion of the outstanding
principal amount of one Type of Advance into another Type of Advance, provided,

Rate Advances shall be due and payable (A) quarterly in arrears on the
last day of each calendar

17
<PAGE>

quarter occurring after the Effective Date and on the Termination Date,
(B) with respect to the principal amount of any voluntary or mandatory
repayment on the date of such voluntary or mandatory repayment and (C) at
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after maturity, on
demand.

(b) Subject to Sections 2.05(e) and 9.11, each Eurodollar Rate
Advance shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from
the date of such Advance at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) which shall, during
each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the lesser of (i) the
Highest Lawful Rate and (ii) the applicable Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Margin. The applicable Eurodollar Rate and the
Margin shall be fixed for each Interest Period and shall not change during
said Interest Period. Interest on each Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be
payable (A) on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (B)
with respect to the principal amount of any voluntary or mandatory
repayment on the date of such voluntary or mandatory repayment, or on the
date of any conversion or continuance and (C) at maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) and, after maturity, on demand.

(c) The Bank, upon determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest
Period, shall notify the Borrower thereof. Each such determination shall,
absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties
hereto. In addition, prior to the due date for the payment of interest on
any Eurodollar Rate Advances set forth in the immediately preceding
paragraph, the Bank shall notify the Borrower of the amount of interest
due by the Borrower on all outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advances on the
applicable due date, but any failure of the Bank to so notify the Borrower
shall not reduce the Borrower's liability for the amount owed.

(d) The Borrower shall pay to the Bank, so long as the Bank shall be
required under regulations of the Board to maintain reserves with respect
to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency
Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each
Eurodollar Rate Advance, from the date of such Advance until such
principal amount is paid in full, at an interest rate per annum equal at
all times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the lesser of
(i) the Highest Lawful Rate and (ii) the remainder obtained by subtracting
(A) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period from (B) the rate
obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate referred to in clause (A) above
by that percentage equal to 100% minus the Reserve Percentage of the Bank
for such Interest Period. Such additional interest shall be determined by
the Bank as incurred and shall be payable upon demand therefor by the Bank
to the Borrower. Each determination by the Bank of additional interest due
under this Section shall be prima facie evidence thereof all purposes in
the absence of manifest error.

(e) Any amount of principal or, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, interest which is not paid when due including, without limitation,
any fundings of Letters of Credit or Existing Letters of Credit for which
the Bank is

18
<PAGE>

not reimbursed (whether by application of the proceeds of Advances under
Section 2.20(c) or otherwise) immediately by the Borrower (whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest from
the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full at
a rate per annum equal at all times to the Prime Rate plus four percent
(4%) per annum but in no event to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate (the
"Default Rate") and shall be payable upon demand.

(f) The Borrower shall, at the time of making each payment of
principal and/or interest hereunder and under the Notes, specify to the
Bank the Advances or other sums payable by the Borrower hereunder or under
the Notes to which such payment is to be applied and in the event that the
Borrower fails to so specify, the Bank may apply such payment as it may
elect in its sole discretion.

Section 2.06. Interest Periods. (a) At the time the Borrower gives
any Borrowing Request or Notice of Conversion in respect of the making of, or
conversion into, a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall have the right to
elect, by giving the Bank on the dates and at the times specified in Section
2.03 or Section 2.04, as the case may be, notice of the interest period (each an
"Interest Period") applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Advance, which Interest
Period shall be either a one, two or three month period; provided, that:

(i) the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advance
shall commence on the date of such Eurodollar Rate Advance (including the
date of any conversion thereto or continuance thereof pursuant to Section
2.04); each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such
Eurodollar Rate Advance shall commence on the day following the expiration
date of the immediately preceding Interest Period;

(ii) if any Interest Period relating to a Eurodollar Rate Advance
begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the
calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period
shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;

(iii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
succeeding Business Day; provided, that if there are no more Business Days
in that month, the Interest Period shall expire on the preceding Business
Day; and

(iv) no Interest Period for Advances shall extend beyond the
Termination Date.

(b) If, upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a
Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower has failed to elect a new Interest Period
to be applicable to such Advance as provided above, the Borrower shall be deemed
to have elected to convert such Advance into a Prime Rate Advance effective as
of the day following the expiration date of such current Interest Period.

19
<PAGE>

Section 2.07. Interest Rate Not Ascertainable. In the event that the
Bank shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) that on any date for determining
the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period, by reason of any changes arising
after the date of this Agreement affecting the Eurodollar interbank market or
the Bank's position in such market, adequate and fair means do not exist for
ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
definition of Eurodollar Rate, then, and in any such event, the Bank shall
forthwith give notice to the Borrower of such determination. Until the Bank
notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to the suspension
described herein no longer exist, the obligations of the Bank to make Eurodollar
Rate Advances shall be suspended.

Section 2.08. Principal Payments of Advances. The unpaid principal
balance of the Advances, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
shall be due and payable on the Termination Date, subject to the mandatory
prepayments required pursuant to Section 2.17.

office at 712 Main Street, Houston, Texas in immediately available funds not
later than 12:00 Noon (Houston, Texas time) on the date when due.

(b) Interest on the Prime Rate Advances shall be computed by the Bank
on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 days, unless such
computation would cause the interest contracted for, charged or received to
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, in which event, interest shall be computed for
the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case
may be. Determination by the Bank of an interest rate hereunder shall be prima
facie evidence of its accuracy.

(c) Whenever any payment hereunder (other than payments of interest
on Eurodollar Rate Advances) shall be stated to be due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
payment of interest, the L/C Fees and all other amounts due under the Loan
Documents, as the case may be.

Section 2.10. Set-Off, Counterclaims and Taxes. All payments of
principal, interest, expenses, reimbursements, compensation and any other amount
from time to time due hereunder, under the Notes or any other Loan Document
shall be made by the Borrower without set-off or counterclaim and shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future tax, levy,
impost or any other charge, if any, of any nature whatsoever now or hereafter
imposed by any taxing authority upon the Borrower. If the making of such
payments is prohibited by law unless such a tax, levy, impost or other charge is
deducted or withheld therefrom, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank, on the date
of each such payment, such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that
the net amounts received by the Bank after such deduction or withholding shall
equal the amounts which would have been

20
<PAGE>

received if such deduction or withholding were not required; provided, however,
that all amounts payable under this Agreement which constitute interest under
applicable law shall not exceed an amount which would result in the payment of
interest at a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.

Section 2.11. The Borrower Unconditionally Liable. The Borrower shall
be unconditionally liable to the Bank for the principal amount of any and all
Advances, any and all L/C Obligations, interest due thereon, the L/C Fees, the
Commitment Fee, and all other amounts due to the Bank hereunder or under any
other agreement or security document executed in connection herewith, and shall
make prompt and punctual payment when due of such amounts.

Section 2.12. Change in Legality. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein contained, if any change in any law or regulation or in the
interpretation thereof by any governmental authority charged with the
administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for the Bank or
its Eurodollar Lending Office to make or maintain any Eurodollar Rate Advance or
to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to
Eurodollar Rate Advances, then, by prompt written notice to the Borrower, the
Bank may:

(i) declare that Eurodollar Rate Advances will not thereafter be
made by the Bank hereunder, whereupon the Borrower shall be prohibited
from requesting Eurodollar Rate Advances from the Bank hereunder unless
such declaration is subsequently withdrawn; and

(ii) in the event that the maintenance of any Eurodollar Rate
Advance(s) shall have been made unlawful, require that all outstanding
Eurodollar Rate Advance(s) made by the Bank be converted to Prime Rate
Advances, in which event (A) all such Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be
automatically converted to Prime Rate Advances as of the effective date of
such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below and (B) all payments and
prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay
the converted Eurodollar Rate Advances shall instead be applied to repay
the Prime Rate Advances resulting from the conversion of such Eurodollar
Rate Advances.

(b) For purposes of this Section, a notice to the Borrower by the
Bank pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be effective on the date of receipt
thereof by the Borrower.

Section 2.13. Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances. (a) It
is understood that the cost to the Bank of making or maintaining any Advance,
Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit may fluctuate as a result of the
applicability of, or changes in, reserve requirements imposed by the Board. The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank from time to time, as provided in paragraph
(d) below, such amounts as shall be necessary to compensate the Bank,
prospectively from the date of demand, for the portion of the cost of making or
maintaining any Advance, Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit resulting
from any such reserve requirements to the extent set forth in this Section.

21
<PAGE>

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of
this Agreement the introduction of any applicable law or regulation or any
change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank with any
applicable guideline or request from any central bank or governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law) (i) shall change the basis of taxation
of payments to the Bank of the principal of or interest on any Advance made by
the Bank, any Existing L/C Obligations, any L/C Obligations or any other fees or
amounts payable hereunder (other than (x) taxes imposed on the overall net
income of the Bank or its applicable lending office by any jurisdiction or by
any political subdivision or taxing authority therein (or any tax which is
enacted or adopted by any such jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing
authority as a direct substitute for any such taxes) or (y) any tax, assessment
or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the
failure of the Bank to comply with any certification, information, documentation
or other reporting requirement), (ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable
any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of, or credit extended by, the Bank (without duplication
of any amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.05(d)), or (iii) shall impose on the
Bank any other condition affecting this Agreement or any Advance made by the
Bank, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to
the Bank of maintaining the Commitment or of making or maintaining any Advance
or issuing or maintaining any Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Bank hereunder
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect thereof by an amount
deemed in good faith by the Bank to be material, then the Borrower shall pay to
the Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such
increase or reduction, upon demand by the Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall the Bank be permitted to receive any compensation hereunder
constituting interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.

(c) If the Bank shall have determined in good faith that any law,
rule, regulation or guideline adopted pursuant to or arising out of the July
1988 Report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory
Practices entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
Standards" or that the adoption of any applicable law, rule, regulation or
guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the foregoing or
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any central bank or other
governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by the Bank with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such central
bank or governmental authority, affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by the Bank or any corporation controlling
the Bank and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the
existence of the Commitment hereunder and other commitments of this type, then
the Borrower shall from time to time pay to the Bank upon demand additional
amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank or such corporation in the light of
such circumstances, to the extent that the Bank reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of the Commitment
hereunder.

22
<PAGE>

(d) If while any Existing Letter of Credit or any Letter of Credit is
outstanding, any law, executive order or regulation is enforced, adopted or
interpreted by any central bank or other governmental authority so as to affect
any of the Borrower's obligations or the compensation to the Bank in respect of
the Existing Letters of Credit or the Letters of Credit or the cost to the Bank
of establishing or maintaining the Existing Letters of Credit or the Letters of
Credit, then the Borrower shall from time to time upon demand, reimburse or
indemnify the Bank with respect thereto so that the Bank shall be in the same
position as if there had been no such enforcement, adoption or interpretation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Bank be permitted to
receive any compensation hereunder constituting interest in excess of the
Highest Lawful Rate.

(e) The Bank will notify the Borrower of any event occurring after
the date of this Agreement which will entitle the Bank to compensation pursuant
to this Section 2.13. A certificate of the Bank setting forth in reasonable
detail (i) such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate the Bank
as specified in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) above as the case may be, and
(ii) the calculation of such amount or amounts shall be simultaneously delivered
to the Borrower and shall be prima facie evidence of its accuracy. The Borrower
shall pay to the Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten
(10) days after Borrower's receipt of the same. The failure of the Bank to
demand increased compensation with respect to any Interest Period shall not
constitute a waiver of the right to demand compensation thereafter.

Section 2.14. Eurodollar Advance Prepayment and Default Penalties.
Subject to Section 9.11, the Borrower shall indemnify the Bank against any
reasonable loss or expense which it may actually sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) an Advance of, or a conversion from or into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances that does not occur on the date specified therefor in a Borrowing
Request or Notice of Conversion (except by reason of Section 2.12) or (b) any
payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Advance required by any
other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made on a date other than the
last day of the applicable Interest Period (except for any conversion under
Section 2.12). Such loss or expense shall include an amount equal to the excess
determined by the Bank of (i) its actual cost of obtaining the funds for the
Advance being paid, prepaid or converted or not borrowed (based on the
Eurodollar Rate) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment or
conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of the Interest Period for such
Advance (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for the
Advance which would have commenced on the date of such failure to borrow) over
(ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by the Bank) that would be
realized in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid or converted or not borrowed
for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. The Bank will notify the
Borrower of any loss or expense which will entitle the Bank to compensation
pursuant to this Section, as promptly as possible after it becomes aware
thereof, but failure to so notify shall not affect the Borrower's liability
therefor. A certificate of the Bank setting forth any amount which it is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be prima facie evidence of its accuracy. The Borrower shall pay to the
Bank the amount shown as due on any certificate within ten (10) days after its
receipt of the same. Without prejudice to the survival of any

23
<PAGE>

other obligations of the Borrower hereunder, the obligations of the Borrower
under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
assignment of any of the Notes.

Section 2.15. Use of Letters of Credit and Proceeds of Advances. The
Borrower will use the proceeds of all Advances made hereunder for working
capital and general business purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and
will use all Letters of Credit issued hereunder for general business purposes of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries provided, any Letter of Credit issued in
support of any Investment by Proler Environmental Services, Inc. in any facility
shall be considered an Investment subject to the limitations of Section 7.09(g).

Section 2.16. Voluntary Prepayments. Upon at least three (3) Business
Days' prior written notice, the Borrower shall have the right to voluntarily
prepay Advances in whole or in part from time to time on the following terms and
conditions: (a) no Eurodollar Rate Advance may be prepaid prior to the last day
of its Interest Period unless, simultaneously therewith, the Borrower pays to
the Bank all sums necessary to compensate the Bank for all costs and expenses
resulting from such prepayment, as reasonably determined by the Bank, described
in Sections 2.05(d), 2.13, and 2.14 hereof and (b) each prepayment pursuant to
this Section shall be applied first, to the payment of accrued and unpaid
interest, and then, to the outstanding principal of such Advances as shall be
designated by the Borrower.

Section 2.17. Mandatory Prepayments. (a) If any Borrowing Base
Certificate shall disclose the existence of a Borrowing Base Deficiency, the
Borrower, on the day that the delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate is
required by Section 6.01(f), shall prepay a principal amount of outstanding
Advances equal to such Borrowing Base Deficiency.

(b) If, on any day, the market valuation of the Inventory of the
Borrower, its Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures included in the Borrowing
Base, based on the American Metals Market Composite Valuation or such other
source of value acceptable to the Bank, is less than or equal to ninety percent
(90%) of the market valuation of such Inventory as disclosed in the most recent
Borrowing Base Certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(f),
the Borrowing Base shall be recalculated by the Borrower as of such date using
such market valuations as of such date and, if such recalculation results in a
Borrowing Base Deficiency, the Borrower, on the third business day following the
date of such recalculation shall deliver a new Borrowing Base Certificate and,
as required by Section 6.01(f), shall prepay a principal amount of outstanding
Advances equal to such Borrowing Base Deficiency.

Section 2.18. Reduction of the Commitment. (a) The Borrower shall
have the right, upon at least three (3) Business Days' notice to the Bank, to
terminate in whole or reduce in part the Unutilized Commitment; provided, that
each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $250,000.00 and an
integral multiple of $250,000.00 in excess thereof.

24
<PAGE>

(b) On the Termination Date the Commitment and the L/C Limit shall be
zero; provided, however, if any one or more Existing Letters of Credit or
Letters of Credit outstanding on the Termination Date have a later expiration
date, then the L/C Limit shall reduce to a level equal to the sum of the undrawn
face amount of each of the then outstanding Existing Letters of Credit and
Letters of Credit (reducing by the amount of any expiring Existing Letter of
Credit or Letter of Credit as it expires) and shall, in any event, terminate in
its entirety on the Extended Termination Date.

Section 2.19. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank a
commitment fee (the /Commitment Fee") for the period from and including the date
hereof to but not including the Termination Date, computed at a rate equal to
one-half of one percent (1/2%) per annum on the daily average of the Unutilized
Commitment. Such Commitment Fee shall be due and payable in arrears on the last
Business Day of each calendar quarter and on the Termination Date.

(b) The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a letter of credit commission
with respect to each Existing Letter of Credit and Letter of Credit payable in
advance and computed for the period from the Effective Date or date of such
payment to the date upon which the next such payment is due hereunder at the
rate of one percent (1%) per annum (which, in the case of Commercial Letters of
Credit, shall be calculated on the basis of one-quarter of one percent (1/4%)
for each 90 day period or any part thereof) of the aggregate amount available to
be drawn under such Existing Letter of Credit and Letter of Credit on the date
on which such fee is calculated or the then minimum letter of credit insurance
fee charged by the Bank, whichever is greater; provided, however, with respect
to each Existing Letter of Credit, the amount of such commission payable to the
Bank shall be reduced by the amount of the commissions already paid to the Bank
with respect to such Existing Letter of Credit with respect to any period from
and after the Effective Date. Such commissions shall be payable in advance on
the Effective Date and on the last day of each calendar quarter occurring
thereafter and shall be nonrefundable.

(c) In addition to the foregoing fees and commissions, the Borrower
shall pay or reimburse the Bank for such normal and customary costs and expenses
as are incurred or charged by the Bank in issuing, effecting payment under,
amending or otherwise administering any Existing Letter of Credit or any Letter
of Credit.

Section 2.20 Letters of Credit and Existing Letters of Credit. (a)(i)
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Bank agrees to issue Letters of
Credit for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day during the Commitment
Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Bank; provided
that the Bank shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after
giving effect to such issuance, the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Limit.
Each Letter of Credit shall (A) be denominated in U. S. Dollars and shall be
either (1) a standby letter of credit issued to support obligations of the
Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise (a "Standby
Letter of Credit") or (2) a documentary letter of credit in respect of the
purchase of goods or services by the Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries
in the ordinary course of business (a "Commercial Letter of Credit") and (B)
expire no later than the Extended Termination Date.

25
<PAGE>

(ii) Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the Uniform
Customs and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of
Texas.

(iii) The Bank shall not at any time be obligated to issue any
Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the
Bank to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable law or regulation.

(b) (i) The Borrower may from time to time request that the Bank
issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Bank at its address for notices
specified herein a request (a "Letter of Credit Request") in the form set forth
as Exhibit 2.20 hereof and an Application therefor, completed to the
satisfaction of the Bank, and such other certificates, documents and other
papers and information as the Bank may reasonably request. The Bank shall not be
required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three (3) Business Days
after its receipt of the Letter of Credit Request and related Application
therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and
information relating thereto. Upon receipt of any Letter of Credit Request and
related Application, the Bank will process such Application and the
certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in
connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and, upon
satisfaction of the applicable terms and conditions set forth in Article IV,
shall promptly issue the original of the Letter of Credit requested to the
beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed by the Bank and the Borrower.
The Bank shall furnish a copy of each Letter of Credit issued hereunder to the
Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof.

(ii) In respect of any Letters of Credit or Existing Letters of
Credit, if any, outstanding on the Termination Date, assuming no Default or
Event of Default has occurred, the Borrower may, at its option, provide to the
Bank collateral in the form of cash or a certificate of deposit issued by the
Bank in the amount of such Letters of Credit or Existing Letters of Credit and
any expenses reasonably anticipated by the Bank in connection therewith,
whereupon the Bank shall release its Liens on all other collateral hereunder or
under any of the Loan Documents. In no event shall any Letters of Credit or
Existing Letters of Credit be outstanding beyond the Extended Termination Date.
The Borrower shall remain liable in respect of such Letters of Credit or
Existing Letters of Credit on terms consistent with the terms hereof, but for
all other purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents the
Obligations will be deemed paid in full and not outstanding and the Commitment
shall be deemed terminated.

(c) The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Bank on each date on which
the Bank notifies the Borrower of the date and amount of a draft presented under
any Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit and paid by the Bank for the
amount of (i) such draft so paid and (ii) any taxes, fees, charges or other
costs or expenses incurred by the Bank in connection with such payment. Upon the
presentment of any draft for honor under any Existing Letter of Credit or Letter
of Credit by the beneficiary thereof which the Bank determines is in compliance
with the condition for payment thereunder, the Bank shall promptly notify the
Borrower. In the event the Bank makes any payment pursuant to a draft presented
under an Existing Letter of Credit or a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall
immediately, upon demand, pay

26
<PAGE>

said amount to the Bank in cash plus any interest due thereon from the date when
due at the Default Rate as provided in Section 2.05(e); provided, said payment
shall, unless otherwise made by the Borrower, come from Advances made under Note
A without requirement of a Borrowing Request if no Default or Event of Default
has occurred hereunder and is continuing, and, if, based on the most recent
Borrowing Base Certificate delivered to the Bank by the Borrower, the aggregate
amount of all outstanding Advances, after giving effect to such Letter of Credit
reimbursement Advance would not exceed the lesser of the Borrowing Base with
respect to making Advances and the Commitment. If, upon delivery of the next
Borrowing Base Certificate due hereunder, it shall be determined that such
Advance has caused said total to exceed the Borrowing Base with respect to
making Advances, the Borrower shall deliver, simultaneous with the delivery of
the Borrowing Base Certificate, immediately available funds to the Bank
sufficient to reduce the outstanding Advances to a sum equal to or less than the
Borrowing Base with respect to making Advances. Any amounts owing and unpaid by
the Borrower, and not advanced under Note A, shall be obligations of the
Borrower evidenced by Note B.

(d) The Borrower's obligations under this Section shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-
off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have had
against the Bank or any beneficiary of an Existing Letter of Credit or a Letter
of Credit. The Borrower also agrees with the Bank that the Bank shall not be
responsible for, and the Borrower's reimbursement obligations under Section
2.20(c) above shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or
genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even through such
documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any
dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Existing Letter
of Credit or Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Existing Letter
of Credit or Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the
Borrower against any beneficiary of such Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of
Credit or any such transferee. The Bank shall not be liable for any error,
omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any
message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Existing Letter
of Credit or Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by the
Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower agrees that any
action taken or omitted by the Bank under or in connection with any Existing
Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done
in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with
the standards or care specified in the Uniform Customs and, to the extent not
inconsistent therewith, the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Texas, shall
be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Bank to
the Borrower.

(e) The responsibility of the Bank to the Borrower in connection with
any draft presented for payment under any Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of
Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in
such Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit be limited to determining
that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Existing Letter
of Credit or Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in
conformity with such Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit.

27
<PAGE>

(f) To the extent that any provision of any Application, certificate,
document or other papers related to any Existing Letter of Credit or Letter of
Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of
this Agreement shall control and no such Application, certificate, document or
other paper shall give the Bank or the Borrower any greater rights than the Bank
or the Borrower would otherwise have under this Agreement.

Section 2.21. Ratification. Each Credit Party hereby confirms and
ratifies the terms of the Security Documents to which it is a party and the
creation of the Liens thereunder to secure the Obligations of the Borrower to
the Bank as more fully set forth therein and further agrees and acknowledges (a)
that, except as otherwise set forth in the Note and Deed of Trust Modification
Agreement, the Liens of the Security Documents to which it is a party extend to
and expressly secure the Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, the
Notes and the other Loan Documents and (b) that the Security Documents to which
it is a party and the Liens created thereunder are valid and subsisting and
shall remain enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms and
shall not be reduced or limited or impaired by the execution of this Agreement
and the Notes. The Bank hereby agrees to promptly release the Liens under the
Security Documents on all property and assets of Proler Environmental Services,
Inc., but not any other Credit Parties, to the extent but only to the extent of
any project financed by Indebtedness permitted by Section 7.02(d), but not
otherwise.


ARTICLE III

GUARANTY

Section 3.01. Guaranty. (a) In consideration of, and in order to
induce the Bank to make Advances and issue Letters of Credit hereunder, the
Guarantors hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably, jointly and
severally guarantee the punctual payment and performance when due, whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and covenants
of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, the Notes and/or
any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party whether for principal,
interest (including interest accruing or becoming owing both prior to and
subsequent to the commencement of any proceeding against or with respect to the
Borrower under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States (11
U.S.C. (S) 101 et seq.) or any other Debtor Relief Law, fees, commissions,
expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) or otherwise, and all
reasonable costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the Bank in connection with
enforcing any rights under this Guaranty (all such obligations being the
"Guaranteed Obligations"). This Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional, present
and continuing guaranty of payment and not of collectibility and is in no way
conditioned upon any attempt to collect from the Borrower or any other action,
occurrence or circumstance whatsoever.

(b) Each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally, agrees to pay and
to indemnify the Bank harmless from and against any damage, loss, cost or
expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that the Bank may incur or be
subject to as a

28
<PAGE>

consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) any breach by such Guarantor or any
other Credit Party of any warranty, covenant, term or condition in, or the
occurrence of any default under, this Guaranty, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, together with all reasonable expenses resulting from the compromise or
defense of any claims or liabilities arising as a result of any such breach or
default and (ii) any legal action commenced to challenge the validity of this
Guaranty, this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Section 3.02. Continuing Guaranty. Each Guarantor guarantees that the
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents. Each Guarantor agrees
that the Guaranteed Obligations and Loan Documents may be extended or renewed,
and Advances repaid and reborrowed in whole or in part, without notice to or
assent by such Guarantor, and that it will remain bound upon this Guaranty
notwithstanding any extension, renewal or other alteration of any Guaranteed
Obligations or Loan Documents, or any repayment and reborrowing of Advances. The
obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms hereof under any circumstances whatsoever, including:

(a) any extension, renewal, modification, settlement, compromise,
waiver or release in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, including any
reduction or termination of all or a portion of the Commitment;

(b) any extension, renewal, amendment, modification, rescission,
waiver or release in respect of any Loan Documents;

(c) any release, exchange, substitution, non-perfection or invalidity
of, or failure to exercise rights or remedies with respect to, any direct
or indirect security for any Guaranteed Obligations, including the release
of any Guarantor or other Person liable on any Guaranteed Obligations;

(d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of
the Borrower, any Guarantor, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization
or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower, such Guarantor, any
other Guarantor or any of their respective assets;

(e) the existence of any claim, defense, set off or other rights or
remedies which such Guarantor at any time may have against the Borrower,
or the Borrower or such Guarantor may have at any time against the Bank,
any other Guarantor or any other Person, whether in connection with this
Guaranty, the Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated thereby or any
other transaction;

(f) any invalidity or unenforceability for any reason of this
Agreement or other Loan Documents, or any provision of law purporting to
prohibit the payment or performance by the Borrower, such Guarantor or any
other Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or Loan Documents, or of any
other obligation to the Bank; or

29
<PAGE>

(g) any other circumstances or happening whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.

Section 3.03. Effect of Debtor Relief Laws. If after receipt of any
payment of, or proceeds of any security applied (or intended to be applied) to
the payment of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Bank is for
any reason compelled to surrender or voluntarily surrenders, such payment or
proceeds to any Person (a) because such payment or application of proceeds is or
may be avoided, invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be
void or voidable as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer,
impermissible set off or a diversion of trust funds, or (b) for any other
reason, including (i) any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative body having jurisdiction over the Bank or any of its properties
or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by the Bank with
any such claimant (including the Borrower), then the Guaranteed Obligations or
part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be reinstated and continue, and this
Guaranty shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds have not
been received, notwithstanding any revocation thereof or the cancellation of any
Note or any other instrument evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise;
and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall be liable to pay the Bank, and
hereby do indemnify the Bank and hold it harmless for the amount of such payment
or proceeds so surrendered and all expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees, court costs and expenses attributable thereto) incurred by the Bank in the
defense of any claim made against it that any payment or proceeds received by
the Bank in respect of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations must be
surrendered. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of
this Guaranty, and any satisfaction and discharge of the Borrower by virtue of
any payment, court order or any federal or state law.

Section 3.04. Waiver of Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or
payments made by any Guarantor hereunder, or any set off or application by the
Bank of any security or of any credits or claims, no Guarantor will assert or
exercise any rights of the Bank or of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any
other Guarantor to recover the amount of any payment made by such Guarantor to
the Bank hereunder by way of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution,
indemnity, or otherwise arising by contract or operation of law, until such time
as the Obligations have been satisfied and the Bank shall have no Commitment. If
any amount shall nevertheless be paid to a Guarantor by the Borrower or another
Guarantor prior to payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, such amount
shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Bank and shall forthwith be paid
to the Bank to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether
matured or unmatured.

Section 3.05. Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates all
indebtedness owing to it from the Borrower to all indebtedness of the Borrower
to the Bank, and agrees that it shall not accept any payment on the same until
payment in full of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, the
Notes, the Letters of Credit, the Existing Letters of Credit and all other Loan
Documents, and shall in no circumstance whatsoever attempt to set off or reduce
any obligations hereunder because of such indebtedness. If any amount shall
nevertheless be paid to a

30
<PAGE>

Guarantor by the Borrower or another Guarantor prior to payment in full of
theGuaranteed Obligations, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of
the Bank and shall forthwith be paid to the Bank to be credited and applied to
the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.

Section 3.06. Waiver. Each Guarantor hereby waives promptness,

Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and waives presentment, demand of
payment, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of dishonor or nonpayment and
any requirement that the Bank institute suit, collection proceedings or take any
other action to collect the Guaranteed Obligations, including any requirement

subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Borrower or
any other Person or any collateral (it being the intention of the Bank and each
Guarantor that this Guaranty is to be a guaranty of payment and not of
collection). It shall not be necessary for the Bank, in order to enforce any
payment by any Guarantor hereunder, to institute suit or exhaust its rights and
remedies against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person,
including others liable to pay any Guaranteed Obligations, or to enforce its
rights against any security ever given to secure payment thereof. Each Guarantor

virtue of the suretyship laws of the State of Texas, including, without
limitation, any and all rights it may have pursuant to Rule 31, Texas Rules of
Civil Procedure, Section 17.001 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code
and Chapter 34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code. Each Guarantor hereby
waives marshaling of assets and liabilities, notice by the Bank of any
indebtedness or liability to which the Bank applies or may apply any amounts
received by the Bank, and of the creation, advancement, increase, existence,
extension, renewal, rearrangement and/or modification of the Guaranteed
Obligations. Each Guarantor expressly waives, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, the benefit of any and all laws providing for exemption of
property from execution or for valuation and appraisal upon foreclosure.

Section 3.07. Full Force and Effect. This Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty and shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the
Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes and all other Loan
Documents and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and until the
termination of the Commitment.

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

In order to induce the Bank to enter into this Agreement, to make the
Advances and issue the Letters of Credit, each Credit Party represents and
warrants to the Bank as to itself, and, to the extent specifically stated, as to

Section 5.01. Organization. Each Credit Party (a) is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, (b) is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in
which such qualification and good standing are necessary in order for such
Credit Party to conduct its business and own its properties as conducted and
owned and except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would
not constitute a Material Adverse Effect and (c) has all requisite power and
authority (corporate or otherwise) to conduct its business as now conducted, to
own or lease its property and assets and to execute, deliver and perform each of
the Loan Documents to which it is or may be a party.

Section 5.02. Authority. The execution, delivery and performance by
each Credit Party of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is
or may be a party and the consummation of the Advances and the issuance of the
Letters of Credit contemplated hereby, have been duly approved by the board of
directors of such Credit Party and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
such Credit Party are necessary to consummate such Advances or issue such
Letters of Credit. Each of the Loan Documents to which such Credit Party is a
party has been duly executed and delivered by such Credit Party and constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party, enforceable
against such Credit Party in accordance with its terms.

Section 5.03. No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by
such Credit Party of each of the Loan Documents to which it is or may be a
party, do not and shall not, by the lapse of time, the giving of notice or
otherwise, (a) constitute a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award presently in effect having
applicability to such Credit Party or a breach of any provision contained in
such Credit Party's articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or
contained in any material agreement, instrument or document to which it is a
party or by which it is bound, other than violations or breaches which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect or
(b) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien whatsoever upon
any of the properties or assets of such Credit Party (other than Liens permitted
by this Agreement and Liens in favor of the Bank arising pursuant to the Loan
Documents).

Section 5.04. Consents. No authorization, consent, approval, permit,
license, or exemption of or filing or registration with, any governmental agency
or any other Person which has not been obtained, was, is or will be necessary
for the

35

Documents to which it is or may be a party.

Section 5.05. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a)

Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of January 31, 1994 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flow and stockholders' equity for
the year then ended, including the related schedules and notes, reported on by
Coopers & Lybrand.

(b) The unaudited consolidated balance sheet and statement of
operations and cash flow of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at October 31,
1994, copies of which has heretofore been furnished to the Bank, are correct in
all material respects, and present fairly the consolidated financial condition
of the Borrower as at such date (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(c) The financial statements referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b)
above, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved.

(d) The Borrower has disclosed to the Bank in writing any and all
facts which would result in, or which Borrower believes may result in, a
Material Adverse Effect and since January 31, 1994, there has been no material
adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, business
prospects or financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole except as to those matters previously disclosed to the Bank as of the date
hereof.

Section 5.06. Litigation; Material Adverse Effect. (a) Except as set
forth in Exhibit 5.06 hereto, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending
or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, threatened or probable of assertion,
against or affecting any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any property
or rights of any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or any
governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign, which, if determined adversely to the Borrower or any such
Subsidiary would constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as otherwise disclosed to the Bank in writing, neither the
business, properties nor operations of any Credit Party nor any of its
Subsidiaries is materially and adversely affected by any fire, explosion,
accident, strike, lockout or other labor dispute, embargo, act of God or act of

set forth in the financial statements referred to in Section 5.05, and except
for the Indebtedness represented by this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan

<PAGE>

Section 5.08. No Margin Stock. No Credit Party nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U), and no
part of the proceeds of any Advance will be used, directly or indirectly, (a) to
purchase or carry any margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose
of purchasing or carrying any margin stock or (b) for the purpose of purchasing,
carrying or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve any
Credit Party in a violation of Regulation X.

Section 5.09. Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All written
estimates, projections and forecasts furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower
and the other Credit Parties to the Bank for purposes of or in connection with
this Agreement, or in connection with any Advance, were and will be prepared on
the basis of assumptions, data, tests or conditions believed to be reasonable,
valid or to represent industry conditions existing at the time such estimates or
forecasts were furnished. Neither this Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan
Documents, the statements and documents referred to in Section 5.05 nor any
other document delivered by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Bank
contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading as of the respective date thereof. The Borrower has not intentionally
withheld any fact known to it which has or is reasonably likely to constitute a
Material Adverse Effect which has not been set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, the Notes, the other Loan Documents or such other document heretofore
furnished to the Bank.

Section 5.10. ERISA. (a) No Reportable Event or withdrawal from or
termination, reorganization or insolvency has occurred and is continuing with
respect to any Plan that would likely constitute a Material Adverse Effect and

withdrawal from, or the termination, reorganization or insolvency of any Plan
that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.11. Government Regulation. No Credit Party nor any of its
Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" or a company directly or indirectly
controlled by or acting on behalf of any Person which is an "investment
company," as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, (b) a
"holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company" or an
"affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, or (c) a "public utility," as such term is defined in the Federal Power

Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has good record and defensible title in fee
simple to or valid leasehold interests in all its real properties and marketable
title to all its other property and assets except where the failure to so have
such title or interest would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>

Section 5.13. Payment of Taxes. The federal income tax returns of the

Subsidiaries required to be filed with the appropriate governmental agencies in
all jurisdictions in which such returns and reports are required to be filed
have been filed and all of the foregoing are true, correct and complete, and the
Borrower paid all taxes and other similar charges, or made adequate provision
therefor, that are due and payable within the time prescribed for filing and
payment or an appropriate extension has been requested and obtained for such
filing or payment except where such failure would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any reporting positions for which it does not have a
reasonable basis and no such Person anticipates any further material tax
liability with respect to the tax years for which returns have been filed. The
Borrower has no knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect which is not being actively contested in good faith.

Articles or Certificate of Incorporation of each Joint Venture that is a
corporation and each agreement creating or governing the rights of the parties
to each other Joint Venture (collectively, the "Joint Venture Agreements") in
existence on the date hereof, as amended to the date hereof. Each Joint Venture
Agreement is in full force and effect and as to each Joint Venture Agreement
creating each non-corporate Joint Venture is enforceable against each Credit
Party which is a party thereto in accordance with its terms.

Section 5.16. Patents. Each Credit Party and each of its Subsidiaries
owns or holds a valid license to use all material patents, trademarks, service
marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses and other rights, that are necessary

respect with, the operation of its business taken as a whole as presently
conducted and as proposed to be conducted.

each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable statutes,

business of each Credit Party and each of its Subsidiaries, as conducted as of
the Effective Date, under any Environmental Law have been secured and each
Credit Party and each of its Subsidiaries is in substantial compliance
therewith, except such licenses, permits, registrations or approvals the failure
to secure or to comply therewith is not likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Credit Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is in noncompliance with,
breach of or default under any applicable writ, order, judgment, injunction, or
decree to which such Credit Party or such Subsidiary is a party or which would
affect the ability of such Credit Party or such Subsidiary to operate any of its
properties and no event has occurred and is continuing which, with the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute noncompliance, breach
of or default thereunder, except in each such case, such noncompliances,
breaches or defaults as are not likely to, in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. There are, as of the Effective Date, no Environmental Claims
pending or, to the best knowledge of any Credit Party, threatened, which (i)
question the validity, term or entitlement of such Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries for any permit, license, order or registration required for the

to be subject to any restrictions on the ownership, occupancy, use or

(including all L/C Obligations and Existing L/C Obligations) shall automatically
become immediately due and payable without, in any case, presentment for
payment, further demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of
acceleration or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by the Borrower, and (y) upon the occurrence of any other Event of
Default, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, (i) declare the Commitment to
be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate and (ii) declare the

cash collateral account shall be applied by the Bank to the payment of drafts
drawn under such Letters of Credit and Existing Letters of Credit, and the

have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account
shall be returned to the Borrower.

Section 8.02. Set-Off in Event of Default. Upon the occurrence and

at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Borrower or any other
Credit Party (any such notice being expressly waived by the Credit Party) and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and apply any and all
deposits (general

55
<PAGE>

or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by the Bank or any branch, subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Bank to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party
against any and all of the obligations of the Credit Parties, now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement (including all L/C Obligations and Existing L/C
Obligations), the Notes or the other Loan Documents to which each such Credit
Party is a party, irrespective of whether or not the Bank shall have made any
demand for satisfaction of such Obligations and although such Obligations may be
unmatured. The Bank agrees to notify the Borrower promptly after any such set-
off and application made by the Bank; provided, however, that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
The rights of the Bank under this Section are in addition to other rights and
remedies (including other rights of set-off) which the Bank may have hereunder
or under any applicable law.

<PAGE>

Section 9.04. Binding Effect; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Credit Parties, the Bank
and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Credit Party may
assign or transfer its respective rights hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Bank.

Section 9.05. Independence of Covenants. All covenants contained in
the Loan Documents shall be given independent effect so that if a particular
action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that
such action or condition would be permitted by an exception to, or otherwise be
within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a
Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

Section 9.06. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
represen tations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, or made in writing by any Credit Party in connection herewith or
therewith, shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Notes, any Letters of Credit, the Existing Letters of Credit and the other Loan
Documents. Any investigation by the Bank shall not diminish in any respect
whatsoever its right to rely on such representations and warranties.

Section 9.07. Separability. Should any clause, sentence, paragraph,
subsection, Section or Article of this Agreement be judicially declared to be
invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision will not have the effect of
invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, and the parties hereto
agree that the part or parts of this Agreement so held to be invalid,
unenforceable or void will be deemed to have been stricken herefrom by the
parties hereto, and the remainder will have the same force and effectiveness as
if such stricken part or parts had never been included herein.

Section 9.08. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Bank
to exercise, and any delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right. The remedies provided in this Agreement and the Notes are cumulative and
not exclusive of any remedies provided in any of the other Loan Documents or by
law.

Section 9.09. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 9.10. Governing Law. This Agreement, the Notes, the Letters
of Credit, the Existing Letters of Credit and, unless otherwise specified
therein, all other Loan Documents and all other documents executed in connection
herewith or therewith, shall be deemed to be contracts and agreements executed
by Credit Parties and the Bank under the laws of the State of Texas and of the
United States and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed by, the laws of the State of Texas and of the United States. Without
limitation of the foregoing,

58
<PAGE>

nothing in this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver of any rights which the Bank may have under federal
legislation relating to the rate of interest which the Bank may contract for,
take, receive, reserve or charge in respect of the Term Loan, any Advance or any
of the other Obligations. The Bank and the Borrower further agree that insofar
as the provisions of Article 1.04, Subtitle 1, Title 79, of the Revised Civil
Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, are applicable to the determina tion of the
Highest Lawful Rate with respect to the Obligations, the indicated (weekly) rate
ceiling computed from time to time pursuant to Section (a) of such Article shall
apply to the Obligations; provided, however, that to the extent permitted by
such Article, the Bank may from time to time by notice from the Bank to the
Borrower revise the election of such interest rate ceiling as such ceiling
affects the then current or future balances outstanding under the Notes. The
provisions of Chapter 15 of Subtitle 3 of the said Title 79 do not apply to this
Agreement, the Notes or any transactions contemplated by any Loan Document.

Section 9.11. Limitation on Interest. Each provision in this
Agreement, the Notes the Letters of Credit, the Existing Letters of Credit and
each other Loan Document is expressly limited so that in no event whatsoever
shall the amount paid, or otherwise agreed to be paid, to the Bank for the use,
forbearance or detention of the money to be advanced under this Agreement, the
Notes or any other Loan Document or otherwise (including any sums paid as
required by any covenant or obligation contained herein or in any other Loan
Document which is for the use, forbearance or detention of such money), exceed
that amount of money which would cause the effective rate of interest to exceed
the Highest Lawful Rate, and all amounts owed under this Agreement and each
other Loan Document shall be held to be subject to reduction to the effect that
such amounts so paid or agreed to be paid which are for the use, forbearance or
detention of money under this Agreement or such Loan Document shall in all
events be less than that amount of money which would cause the effective rate of
interest to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate. Anything in this Agreement, the
Notes, the Letters of Credit, the Existing Letters of Credit or any other Loan
Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower shall never be required
to pay unearned interest on the Advances or any of the other Obligations or ever
be required to pay interest on the Advances or any of the other Obligations at a
rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, or if the holder of any of the
Advances or any of the other Obligations shall receive any unearned interest or
shall receive monies that are deemed to constitute interest which would increase
the effective rate of interest payable by the Borrower under this Agreement,
such Note and the other Loan Documents to a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful
Rate, then (a) the amount of interest which would otherwise be payable by the
Borrower under this Agreement, such Note and other Loan Documents shall be
reduced to the amount allowed under applicable law and (b) any unearned interest
paid by the Borrower or any interest paid by the Borrower in excess of the
Highest Lawful Rate shall be in the first instance credited on the principal of
such Note with the excess thereof, if any, refunded to the Borrower. It is
further agreed that, without limitation of the foregoing, all calculations of
the rate of interest contracted for, charged or received by the Bank under the
Notes, this Agreement, the Letters of Credit, the Existing Letters of Credit or
the other Loan Documents, are made for the purpose of determining whether such
rate exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, and shall be made, to the extent

59
<PAGE>

permitted by usury laws applicable to the Bank (now or hereafter enacted), by
amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading in equal parts during the period
of the full stated term of the Obligations evidenced by the Notes all interest
at any time contracted for, charged or received by the Bank in connection
therewith. If at any time and from time to time, (x) the amount of interest
payable to the Bank on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate
pursuant to this Section and (y) in respect of any subsequent interest
computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable to the Bank would be
less than the amount of interest payable to the Bank computed at the Highest
Lawful Rate, then to the extent permitted by applicable usury law, the amount of
interest payable to the Bank in respect of such subsequent interest computation
period shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total
amount of interest payable to the Bank shall equal the total amount of interest
which would have been payable to the Bank if the total amount of interest had
been computed without giving effect to this Section.

Section 9.12. Indemnification. (a) The Borrower and each other Credit
Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Bank, as well as its officers,
employees, agents, directors, shareholders, counsels and Affiliates
(collectively, "Indemnified Persons") harmless from and against any and all
loss, liability, damage, judgment, claim, deficiency, penalty, fine, response
and remediation cost, stabilization cost, encapsulation cost, treatment, storage
or disposal cost, groundwater monitoring or environmental sampling cost or any
other reasonable cost or expense (including interest, penalties, reasonable
attorneys', experts' or consultants' fees, and disbursements in connection with
any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding and amounts paid in
settlement) (collectively, "Indemnified Liabilities") incurred by or asserted
against any Indemnified Person arising out of, in any way connected with, or as
a result of (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, the performance by the parties hereto and thereto of their respective
obligations hereunder and thereunder (including the making of the Commitment of
the Bank) and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
(ii) the actual or proposed use of the Letters of Credit, the Existing Letters
of Credit or the proceeds of the Advances, (iii) any past, present or future
violation by Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, any operator who is not an
Indemnified Person of the Mortgaged Properties, or any other Person (other than
any Indemnified Person) of any requirement of law, including Environmental Laws,
with regard to the ownership, operation, use or occupancy of the Mortgaged
Properties occurring at any time prior to the repayment in full of the Advances
and the other Obligations, (iv) solely insofar as any of the following arises
out of any Mortgaged Property, the past, present or future treatment, storage,
disposal, generation, use, transport, movement, migration, presence, release,
spill or emission of any pollutants, contaminants, Hazardous Materials, or
hazardous or toxic substances or wastes into or onto soil, land, surface water,
ground water, watercourses, publicly owned treatment works, drains, sewer
systems, wetlands or septic systems occurring at any time prior to the repayment
in full of the Advances and the other Obligations, (v) ownership by the Bank of
any real or personal property following rightful foreclosure under the Security
Documents, to the extent such losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, claims,
deficiencies or expenses arise out of or result from the presence or release of
any Hazardous Materials in, on or under such property during the period owned,
leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its

60
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, claims, deficiencies or expenses which are imposed under
Environmental Laws upon Persons by virtue of their ownership, (vi) foreseeable
consequential or punitive damages incurred as a result of any matter or claim
described above or (vii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnified Person is a
party thereto.

(b) WITHOUT LIMITING ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BUT IN ALL EVENTS SUBJECT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (C) OF THIS
SECTION 9.12, IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENTION OF THE BORROWER AND THE OTHER CREDIT
PARTIES THAT EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON SHALL BE INDEMNIFIED AND HELD HARMLESS
AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DEFICIENCIES, JUDGMENTS OR
REASONABLE EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THE ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY) OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON. THE OBLIGATIONS OF
THE BORROWER AND THE OTHER CREDIT PARTIES UNDER THIS SECTION 9.12 SHALL SURVIVE
THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE COMMITMENT AND THE REPAYMENT OF THE
OBLIGATIONS.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or any other document or instrument, in no event shall any
Credit Party be liable in any manner with respect to any or all Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent arising from any acts or omissions constituting gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any Indemnified Person.

(d) With respect to all Indemnified Liabilities relating to any
Mortgaged Property or any Hazardous Material or any Environmental Law,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or any other document or instrument, no Credit Party shall be liable (x) for any
acts of any Indemnified Person or of any Person acting on behalf of or at the
direction of any Indemnified Person, or (y) in the event that any Indemnified
Person, or any Person acting on behalf of or at the direction of any Indemnified
Person, is judicially or administratively determined to be a Person having
management participation or otherwise exercising control within the meaning of
the Environmental Laws in effect on the date of this Agreement, for any omission
of any Indemnified Person or any omission of any Person acting on behalf of, or
at the direction of any Indemnified Person, or (z) for any act or omission of
any Person occurring from and after the date on which none of the Credit Parties
holds title to such Mortgaged Property; provided, however, that this clause (z)
shall not release any Credit Party from any liability which it would otherwise
have under this subparagraph (d) for conditions arising prior to said date as to
which any Indemnified Liability is asserted subsequent to said date.

61
<PAGE>

Section 9.13. Notice and Defense of Claims. (a) The Credit Parties
shall give prompt notice to the Bank of:

(i) their receipt of any correspondence, demand, notice, order,
complaint, notice of violation, assessment, claim or request for
information issued pursuant to or under color of any Environmental Laws or
which refers to any Hazardous Materials from any federal, state or local
governmental authority or from any private party or organization with
respect to the Mortgaged Properties, any operator of the Mortgaged
Properties or any Credit Party, which, in the reasonable good faith
judgment of the Credit Parties, is likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect;

(ii) the institution of any claim, suit, action, investigation or
administrative or judicial proceeding or action (formal or informal) of
which the Credit Parties are aware, brought with regard to the condition,
use, ownership, operation, occupancy or maintenance of the Mortgaged
Properties under the Environmental Laws or relating to Hazardous Materials
which claim, suit, action, investigation or administrative or judicial
proceeding or action, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Credit
Parties, is likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and

(iii) the discovery or detection, of which the Credit Parties are
aware, by any Person, of Hazardous Materials on the Mortgaged Properties
which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Credit Parties, is
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Credit Parties shall retain the exclusive right, at their
option, to compromise, settle or defend, at their expense and with their own
counsel, any Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that the Credit Parties
shall provide the Bank with all such copies of documents and pleadings relating
to such Indemnified Liabilities as the Bank may reasonably request; provided,
further, that in the case of any action in which any Indemnified Person is a
named party thereto, such counsel retained by the Credit Parties shall be
reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person. In the case of any such action
in which an Indemnified Person is a named party thereto, the Credit Parties, at
the request of such Indemnified Person, shall keep such Indemnified Person
apprised of all matters relevant to such action and such Indemnified Person
shall have the full right, at its own expense, to participate, through counsel
or otherwise, in all meetings and proceedings with adverse parties or
governmental authorities (other than any confidential meetings unrelated to
claims against such Indemnified Person); provided, however, that if any of the
Credit Parties give notice in writing to such Indemnified Person that the Credit
Parties do not intend, for whatever reason, to defend any such action, then such
Indemnified Person may prosecute its own defense or response with its own
counsel and the reasonable fees of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Credit Parties for that portion of the action relating to any Indemnified
Liabilities if: (x) such Indemnified Person shall prosecute such defense or
response diligently and in an appropriate manner and (y) such Indemnified
Person, at the request of any of the Credit Parties, shall keep the Credit
Parties apprised of all matters relevant to such action; provided, further, that
in the event that such Indemnified Person does not consent to any settlement or

62
<PAGE>

compromise proposed by the parties to such action and acceptable to the Credit
Parties, then the liability of the Credit Parties under Sections 9.12 and 9.13
of this Agreement for any Indemnified Liabilities shall not exceed that
liability which the Credit Parties would have had if such Indemnified Person had
consented to such settlement or compromise.

(c) Upon the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by
subsection (a) above relating to any Mortgaged Property, the Bank shall have
(but need not exercise) the right to retain, at its own expense, consultants and
specialists of the Bank's choice to assess the necessity for and appropriateness
of the investigation, removal, remediation, encapsulation or other treatment of
any Hazardous Materials found on the Mortgaged Properties. If the Bank
reasonably determines that any such activities are necessary and appropriate to
prevent the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect, it shall deliver written
notice to the Credit Parties of the basis of such determination, describing such
activities with reasonable specificity. Upon receipt of such notice, and if such
activities are required by law, the Credit Parties will diligently, and in a
reasonable manner, undertake and complete such activities to the Bank's
reasonable satisfaction, at the Credit Parties' sole expense.

(d) The Indemnified Persons shall give prompt written notice to the
Credit Parties of any claim against the Indemnified Persons which might give
rise to a claim by the Indemnified Persons against the Credit Parties under
Section 9.12.

Section 9.14. Limitation by Law. All rights, remedies and powers
provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be exercised only to
the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision
of law, and all the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law which
may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will
not render this Agreement or any other Loan Document invalid, unenforceable, in
whole or in part, or not entitled to be recorded, registered or filed under the
provisions of any applicable law.

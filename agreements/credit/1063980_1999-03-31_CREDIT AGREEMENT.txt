amount of the Term Loan not yet advanced from the date hereof to and including
the date that the Term Loan is fully advanced, payable on the dates of the
Advances under the Term Loan as provided in Section 2.1.2. The Borrower may
permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment (which shall also result in a
reduction in the commitment fee provided for in the first sentence of this
Section) in whole, or in part ratably among the Lenders in integral multiples of
$5,000,000, upon at least three Business Days' written notice to the Agent,
which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction, provided, however,
that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be reduced below the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Advances. All accrued commitment
fees shall be payable on the effective date of any termination of the
obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder.

2.6. Minimum Amount of Each Advance. Each Eurodollar Advance and each
Floating Rate Advance shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 (and in
multiples of $100,000 if in excess thereof), provided, however, that any
Floating Rate Advance may be in the amount of the unused Aggregate Commitment.

2.7. Optional Principal Payments. The Borrower may from time to time
pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate Advances, or, in
a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple of $100,000 in
excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances upon one
Business Days' prior notice to the Agent. The Borrower may from time to time
pay, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by
Section 3.4 but without penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurodollar Advances,
or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof, any portion of the outstanding Eurodollar Advances
upon three Business Days' prior notice to the Agent. Prior to the occurrence of
an Unmatured Default, principal payments shall be applied to the Loans as
determined by Borrower; after the occurrence of an Unmatured Default, principal
payments shall be applied to the Loans as determined by Required Lenders. In any
event, principal installments applied to the Term Loan shall be applied in the
inverse order of maturity.

2.8. Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances.
The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each
Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time.
The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "BORROWING NOTICE") not
later than 10:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) at least one Business Day before the
Borrowing Date of each Floating Rate Advance and three Business Days before the
Borrowing Date for each Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

(i)   the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
Advance,

(ii)  the aggregate amount of such Advance,

(iii) the Type of Advance selected, and

(iv) in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period
applicable thereto.

Not later than noon (Dallas, Texas time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender
shall make available its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available in Dallas,
Texas to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII. The Agent
will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at
the Agent's aforesaid address. Borrower shall be entitled to no more than five
(5) Eurodollar Loans outstanding at any one time.

2.9. Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. Floating Rate
Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Floating
Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar Advances pursuant to this Section
2.9 or are repaid in accordance with Section 2.7. Each Eurodollar Advance shall
continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest
Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically
converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless (x) such Eurodollar Advance is or
was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (y) the Borrower shall have given
the Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that,
at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Advance continue as a
Eurodollar Advance for the same or another Interest Period. Subject to the terms
of Section 2.6, the Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any
part of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance. The Borrower shall
give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "CONVERSION/CONTINUATION NOTICE") of each
conversion of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Advance or continuation
of a Eurodollar Advance not later than 10:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) at least
three Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion or
continuation, specifying:

(i)   the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
conversion or continuation,

(ii)  the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be
converted or continued, and

(iii) the amount of such Advance which is to be converted into or
continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the Interest
Period applicable thereto.

2.10. Changes in Interest Rate, etc. Each Floating Rate Advance shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and
including the date such Advance is made or is automatically converted from a
Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but
excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a Eurodollar Advance pursuant
to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such
day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 16
<PAGE>   23

of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect
simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurodollar
Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and
including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not
including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined
by the Agent as applicable to such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrower's
selections under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 and otherwise in accordance with the terms
hereof. No Interest Period may end after the Facility Termination Date.

2.11. Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, during the continuance of a Default or
Unmatured Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the
Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders
notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the
Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no Advance may be made as,
converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance. During the continuance of a
Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower
(which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders
notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the
Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance
shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the
rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 3% per annum and (ii)
each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the
Floating Rate in effect from time to time plus 3% per annum, provided that,
during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates
set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be applicable to all Advances
without any election or action on the part of the Agent or any Lender.

2.12. Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder
shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to
Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in
writing by the Agent to the Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due
and shall be applied ratably by the Agent among the Lenders. Each payment
delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly
by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at
its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation
specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender. The Agent is
hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower maintained with Bank One
for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.

2.13. Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness. (i) Each Lender
shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each
Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

(ii)  The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record
(a) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest
Period with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder
and (c) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from the Borrower
and each Lender's share thereof.

(iii) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure
of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall
not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations
in accordance with their terms.


CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 17
<PAGE>   24



(iv)  Any Lender may request that its Loans under the Term Loan be
evidenced by a promissory note (a "TERM NOTE"). In such event, the Borrower
shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Term Note payable to the
order of such Lender in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-1. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such Term Note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one
or more Term Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein or any
assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or
assignee subsequently returns any such Term Note for cancellation and requests
that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (i) and (ii)
above.

(v)   Any Lender may request that its Loans under the Revolving Credit
Facility be evidenced by a promissory note (a "REVOLVING NOTE"). In such event,
the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Revolving Note
payable to the order of such Lender in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-2.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Revolving Note and interest thereon
shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be
represented by one or more Revolving Notes payable to the order of the payee
named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent
that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Revolving Note
for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as
described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.

2.14. Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders
and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of
Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any
person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on
behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is
specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation
Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent
or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the
written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by
the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error.

2.15. Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued
on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof and at maturity.
Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of
its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is
prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued
on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months
shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such
Interest Period. Interest and commitment fees shall be calculated for actual
days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the
day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if
payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any
payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time
shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.

2.16. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and
Commitment Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice,
Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received
by it hereunder. The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate
applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such
interest rate and will give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the
Alternate Base Rate.


CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 18
<PAGE>   25



2.17. Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be
deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.
Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance
with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations
through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are
to be made.

2.18. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Borrower or a
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If
such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the
Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

2.19. Extension of Revolving Credit Termination Date. The Borrower may
request an extension of the Revolving Credit Termination Date by submitting a
request for an extension to the Agent (an "EXTENSION REQUEST") no more than 60
days prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date. The Extension Request must
specify the new Revolving Credit Termination Date requested by the Borrower and
the date (which must be at least 30 days after the Extension Request is
delivered to the Agent) as of which the Lenders must respond to the Extension
Request (the "RESPONSE DATE"). The new Revolving Credit Termination Date shall
be no more than 364 days after the Revolving Credit Termination Date in effect
at the time the Extension Request is received, including the Revolving Credit
Termination Date as one of the days in the calculation of the days elapsed.
Promptly upon receipt of an Extension Request, the Agent shall notify each
Lender of the contents thereof and shall request each Lender to approve the
Extension Request. Each Lender approving the Extension Request shall deliver its
written consent no later than the Response Date. If the consent of each of the
Lenders is received by the Agent, the Revolving Credit Termination Date
specified in the Extension Request shall become effective on the existing
Revolving Credit Termination Date and the Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower and each Lender of the new Revolving Credit Termination Date.

2.20. Replacement of Lender. If the Borrower is required pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances
into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender
so affected an "AFFECTED LENDER"), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts
continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such
Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or
Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such
replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i)
another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Advances
and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment
substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes
under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be
terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3
applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Affected
Lender in same day

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 19
<PAGE>   26

funds on the day of such replacement all interest, fees and other amounts then
accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and
including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to
such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5.

ARTICLE III

YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

3.1. Yield Protection. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the
adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency:

(i)   subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any
Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than with
respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its Eurodollar
Loans, or

(ii)  imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment
insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any
Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and
assessments taken into account in determining the interest rate
applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

(iii) imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of
making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or reduces any
amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
in connection with its Eurodollar Loans, or requires any Lender or any
applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by
reference to the amount of Eurodollar Loans held or interest received
by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or
Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending
Installation in connection with such Eurodollar Loans or Commitment, then,
within 30 days of demand by such Lender and delivery to the Borrower of a
certified calculation of the amounts owed hereunder, the Borrower shall pay such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
increased cost or reduction in amount received.

3.2. Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines
the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 30 days of demand by such
Lender and delivery to the Borrower of a certified calculation of the amounts
owed hereunder, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to
compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such
increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this
Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking
into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "CHANGE" means (i)
any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines
or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this
Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 20
<PAGE>   27

Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender.
"RISK-BASED CAPITAL GUIDELINES" means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in
effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement, including transition
rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory
authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the
Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards,"
including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior
to the date of this Agreement.

3.3. Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines that
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits
of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not
available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, then
the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances and require any
affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate
Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4.

3.4. Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment (other than prepayments pursuant to
Section 2.2.3) or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Advance is not made on the date
specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, the
Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it
resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in
liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Eurodollar
Advance.

3.5. Taxes. (i) All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear
of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If the Borrower shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable
hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such
deductions, (c) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the Borrower shall furnish
to the Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof within 30
days after such payment is made.

(ii)  In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes,
charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under
any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to,
this Agreement or any Note ("OTHER TAXES").

(iii) The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by
the Agent or such Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Payments due under this
indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date the Agent or such
Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

(iv)  Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof (each a "NON-U.S. LENDER") agrees that it
will, not less than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, (i)
deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of
United States

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 21
<PAGE>   28

Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that such
Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, and (ii) deliver to each
of the Borrower and the Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form W-8 or W-9,
as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an exemption from United
States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to
deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent (x) renewals or additional copies
of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form
expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or
amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent.
All forms or amendments described in the preceding sentence shall certify that
such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an
event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment with
respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not
capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United
States federal income tax.

(v)   For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv), above
(unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was
required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed by the
United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt
from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes
because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv), above, the
Borrower shall take such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request
to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.

(vi)  Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note
pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to
the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times prescribed by
applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at
a reduced rate.

(vii) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
authority of the United States or any other country or any political subdivision
thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly withhold tax from
amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form
was not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify
the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from
withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify
the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent as
tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and
including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Agent
under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related thereto
(including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which
attorneys may be employees of the Agent). The obligations of the Lenders under
this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the Obligations and
termination of this Agreement.

3.6. Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in
the judgment of such Lender,

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 22
<PAGE>   29

disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of
such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if
any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth
in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such
amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence
of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in
connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender
funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and
maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or
not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written
statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower
of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1,
3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

4.1. Initial Advance. The Lenders shall not be required to make the
initial Advance hereunder unless the Borrower has furnished to the Agent:

(i)    Copies of the articles or certificate of incorporation of the
Borrower and each Guarantor, together with all amendments, and a certificate of
good standing, each certified by the appropriate governmental officer in its
jurisdiction of incorporation.

(ii)   Copies, certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
Borrower and each Guarantor, of their by-laws and of their Board of Directors'

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

5.1. Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower, Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership (in the case of
Subsidiaries only) or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated
or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such
concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to
conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.

5.2. Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the power and
authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents to which it
is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery
by the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the performance
of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate
proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the
Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally.


CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 24
<PAGE>   31



5.3. No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor the
consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the
provisions thereof will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate
of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or
certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating or other management
agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture,
instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with
or constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary
pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order,
consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or
filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in
respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision
thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings
under this Agreement, the payment and performance by the Borrower of the
Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
of the Loan Documents.

5.4. Financial Statements. The September 30, 1998, consolidated
financial statements of the Parent, Borrower and their respective Subsidiaries
heretofore delivered to the Lenders were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in effect on the date such statements were
prepared and fairly present the consolidated financial condition and operations
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results
of their operations for the period then ended.

5.5. Material Adverse Change. Since September 30, 1998 there has been
no change in the business, Property, prospects, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of the Parent, Borrower and their respective
Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

5.6. Taxes. The Parent, Borrower and their respective Subsidiaries have
filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are
required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or
pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which
adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles. No tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with
respect to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental
charges are adequate. If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a limited
liability company, each such limited liability company qualifies for partnership
tax treatment under United States federal tax law.

5.7. Litigation and Contingent Obligations. There is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of
any Loans. Other than any liability incident to any litigation, arbitration or
proceeding which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, the Borrower has no material contingent obligations not provided for or
disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 5.4.

5.8. Subsidiaries. Schedule 1 contains an accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of Parent and the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement,
setting forth their respective jurisdictions of organization and the

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 25
<PAGE>   32

percentage of their respective capital stock or other ownership interests owned
by Parent, the Borrower or other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have
been (to the extent such concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership
interests) duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

5.9.  ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans do
not in the aggregate exceed $500,000. Neither the Borrower nor any other member
of the Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur, any
withdrawal liability to Multiemployer Plans in excess of $500,000 in the
aggregate. Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and regulations, no Reportable Event has occurred with
respect to any Plan, neither the Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled
Group has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to do so, and no steps have
been taken to reorganize or terminate any Plan.

5.10. Accuracy of Information. No information, exhibit or report
furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or to any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan
Documents contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a
material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading.

5.11. Regulation U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U)
constitutes less than 25% of the value of those assets of Parent, the Borrower
and their Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or
other restriction hereunder.

5.12. Material Agreements. Neither Parent, the Borrower nor any of
their Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any
charter or other corporate restriction which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent, the Borrower nor any of their
Subsidiaries is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any
of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in (i) any agreement to
which it is a party, which default could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or
governing Indebtedness in excess of $50,000.

5.13. Compliance With Laws. Parent, the Borrower and their Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with all applicable statutes, rules,
regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or
any instrumentality or agency thereof having jurisdiction over the conduct of
their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective Property.

5.14. Ownership of Properties. Except as set forth on Schedule 2, on
the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will have good
title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by Section 6.15, to all of
the Property and assets reflected in the Borrower's most recent consolidated
financial statements provided to the Agent as owned by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.

5.15. Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions. Neither Parent nor the
Borrower is an entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29
C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 of an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) which is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code), neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
making of Loans hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and "benefit plan
investors" (as defined in 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101(f)) do not own 25% or more of
the value of any class of equity interests in the Borrower.


CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 26
<PAGE>   33



5.16. Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of its business,
the officers of the Borrower consider the effect of Environmental Laws on the
business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which they
identify and evaluate potential risks and liabilities accruing to the Borrower
due to Environmental Laws. On the basis of this consideration, the Borrower has
concluded that Environmental Laws cannot reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received
any notice to the effect that its operations are not in material compliance with
any of the requirements of applicable Environmental Laws or are the subject of
any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is
needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into
the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.17. Investment Company Act. Neither Borrower nor Parent is an
"investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

5.18. Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.

5.19. Year 2000. The Borrower has made a full and complete assessment
of any potential Year 2000 Problems and has a realistic and achievable program
for remediating such Year 2000 Problems on a timely basis (the "YEAR 2000
PROGRAM"). Based on such assessment and on the Year 2000 Program the Borrower
does not reasonably anticipate that Year 2000 Problems will have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.20. Insurance. The certificate signed by the President or Chief
Financial Officer of the Borrower, that attests to the existence and adequacy
of, and summarizes, the property and casualty insurance program carried by the
Borrower with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries and that has been furnished
by the Borrower to the Agent and the Lenders, is complete and accurate. This
summary includes the insurer's or insurers' name(s), policy number(s),
expiration date(s), amount(s) of coverage, type(s) of coverage, exclusion(s),
and deductibles. This summary also includes similar information, and describes
any reserves, relating to any self-insurance program that is in effect.

5.21. Solvency. (i) Immediately after the consummation of the
transactions to occur on the date hereof and immediately following the making of
each Loan, if any, made on the date hereof and after giving effect to the
application of the proceeds of such Loans, (a) the fair value of the assets of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation,
will exceed the debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (b) the present fair
saleable value of the Property of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay
the probable liability of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis on their debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c)
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be able to pay
their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital
with which to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such
businesses are now conducted and are proposed to be conducted after the date
hereof.

(ii)  The Borrower does not intend to, or to permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, and does not believe that it or any of its Subsidiaries will,
incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, taking

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 27
<PAGE>   34

into account the timing of and amounts of cash to be received by it or any such
Subsidiary and the timing of the amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect
of its Indebtedness or the Indebtedness of any such Subsidiary.

ARTICLE VIII

ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES


8.1. Acceleration. If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7
occurs with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make
Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part of
the Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or
the Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the
obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder, or declare the Obligations
to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall become
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

If, within 30 days after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or
entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the
Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration
and/or termination.

8.2. Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any
Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall,
without the consent of all of the Lenders:

(i)  Extend the final maturity of any Loan or postpone any regularly
scheduled payment of principal of any Loan or forgive all or any portion of the
principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
interest or fees thereon.

(ii) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
Lenders.

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 36
<PAGE>   43

(iii) Extend the Facility Termination Date, the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, or reduce the amount or extend the payment date for, the
mandatory payments required under Section 2.2, or increase the amount of the
Aggregate Commitment or of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder, or permit the
Borrower to assign its rights under this Agreement.

(iv)  Amend this Section 8.2.

(v)   Release any guarantor of any Advance or, except as provided in
the Collateral Documents, in one transaction or series of transactions, release
all or a Substantial Portion of the Collateral.

(vi)  Amend the definition of Borrowing Base.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall be
effective without the written consent of the Agent. The Agent may waive payment
of the fee required under Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent of any
other party to this Agreement.

8.3. Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of
the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in
the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in
full.

<PAGE>   44

obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer any
right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties
hereto expressly agree that the Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the
provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.11 to the extent specifically set forth
therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf
and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.

9.6. Expenses; Indemnification. (i) THE BORROWER SHALL REIMBURSE THE
AGENT AND THE ARRANGER FOR ANY COSTS, INTERNAL CHARGES AND OUT-OF-POCKET
EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND TIME CHARGES OF ATTORNEYS FOR THE AGENT,

OR DUTY TO PREPARE OR TO DISTRIBUTE TO THE LENDERS) CERTAIN AUDIT REPORTS (THE
"REPORTS") PERTAINING TO THE BORROWER'S ASSETS FOR INTERNAL USE BY BANK ONE FROM
INFORMATION FURNISHED TO IT BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE BORROWER, AFTER BANK ONE HAS
EXERCISED ITS RIGHTS OF INSPECTION PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

(ii) THE BORROWER HEREBY FURTHER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY THE AGENT, THE
ARRANGER AND EACH LENDER, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES AGAINST ALL
LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS, LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES

THEREFOR WHETHER OR NOT THE AGENT, THE ARRANGER OR ANY LENDER IS A PARTY

DIRECT OR INDIRECT APPLICATION OR PROPOSED APPLICATION OF THE PROCEEDS OF ANY
LOAN HEREUNDER EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED IN A FINAL
NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO HAVE RESULTED
FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE PARTY SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION. THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER UNDER THIS SECTION 9.6 SHALL
SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

9.7. Omitted.

9.8. Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 38
<PAGE>   45

Agreement Accounting Principles, except that any calculation or determination
which is to be made on a consolidated basis shall be made for the Borrower and
all its Subsidiaries, including those Subsidiaries, if any, which are
unconsolidated on the Borrower's audited financial statements.

9.9. Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

9.10. Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on
the one hand and the Lenders and the Agent on the other hand shall be solely

the Arranger nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether
sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in
connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions
contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act,
omission or event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in
a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
losses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party
from which recovery is sought. Neither the Agent, the Arranger nor any Lender
shall have any liability with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives,
releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect or consequential
damages suffered by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any
way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

proceeding to which such Lender is a party, (vi) to such Lender's direct or
indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements or to legal counsel,

ARTICLE X

THE AGENT

10.1. Appointment; Nature of Relationship. Bank One is hereby appointed
by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as
the "AGENT") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the
Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article
X. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Agent," it is expressly
understood and agreed that the Agent shall not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative
of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders'
contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary
duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within
the meaning of Section 9-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting
as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to
those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each
of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any agency
theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of
which claims each Lender hereby waives.

10.2. Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under
the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of
each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

10.3. General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or
any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder
or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except
to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

10.4. No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty
or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except
receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Agent; (d) the existence
or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document
or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the
value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any
collateral security; or (g) the financial condition of the Borrower or any
guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower's or any such
guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to
the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to
the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the
Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).

10.5. Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under
any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders (unless the consent of more than the Required Lenders is
required pursuant to Section 8.2, in which case the Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any
other Loan Document in accordance with written

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 40
<PAGE>   47

instructions signed by the Lenders required by such Section), and such
instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agent
shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by
it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. The
Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost
and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

10.6.  Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of
its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

10.7.  Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

10.8.  Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the
enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other
documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing
to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required
pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions
thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

10.9.  Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Lenders.

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 41
<PAGE>   48

10.10. Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Agent, in its
individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

10.11. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

10.12. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause
by written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal
to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after
the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any
time without the consent of the Borrower or any Lender, appoint any of its
Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder. If the
Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed,
the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrower
shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender
and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor
Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has
accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the
Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this
Section 10.12, then the term "Corporate Base Rate" as used in this Agreement
shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

10.13. Agent's Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for its
own account, the fees agreed to by the Borrower and the Agent pursuant to that
certain letter agreement dated of even date herewith or as otherwise agreed from
time to time.

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 42
<PAGE>   49

10.14. Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrower and the Lenders agree
that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

10.15. Execution of Collateral Documents. The Lenders hereby empower
and authorize the Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower on their behalf
the Collateral Documents and all related financing statements and any financing
statements, agreements, documents or instruments as shall be necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of the Collateral Documents.

10.16. Collateral Releases. The Lenders hereby empower and authorize
the Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower on their behalf any agreements,
documents or instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect any
releases of Collateral which shall be permitted by the terms hereof or of any
other Loan Document or which shall otherwise have been approved by the Required
Lenders (or, if required by the terms of Section 8.2, all of the Lenders) in
writing.

10.17. Co-Agents and Arranger. Neither any of the Lenders identified in
this Agreement as a "co-agent" (if any) nor the Arranger shall have any right,
power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other
than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing,
none of such Lenders nor the Arranger shall have or be deemed to have a
fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same
acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the
Agent in Section 10.11.

ARTICLE XI

SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

11.1. Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may
be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such
Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due.

11.2. Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any
other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of
the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will
hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection with
setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives
collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be
subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action
necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably
in proportion to their Loans. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal
process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made. If an
amount to be setoff is to be applied to Indebtedness of the Borrower to a Lender
other than Indebtedness comprised of Loans made by such Lender, such amount
shall be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness
comprised of such Loans.

11.3. Proceeds of Collateral. Lenders agree, among themselves, that
unless otherwise agreed to by Agent and the Required Lenders, all monies
collected or received by Agent after the occurrence of an


CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 43
<PAGE>   50

Event of Default in respect of the security for the Loans, directly or
indirectly, or by any other means shall be applied (a) to all costs of
collection or maintenance of the Collateral, and then to either interest or
principal of the Loans as recommended by Agent and approved by the Required
Lenders (except that any amounts to be applied to interest or principal shall be
distributed to Lenders based on their Commitment Percentage) until the Loans are
paid in full, and (b) to any Rate Hedging Obligations owed to any Lender under
any Rate Hedging Agreement, only after payment in full of the outstanding
principal and interest under the Loans.


ARTICLE XII

BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS


12.1. Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section, any Lender may
at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the Agent, assign all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank shall
release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Agent may
treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with
Section 12.3 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other
transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Agent. Any assignee
or transferee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such
transfer or assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of
making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the
rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof),
shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee
of the rights to such Loan.




12.2.    Participations.

12.2.1. Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law,
at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities
("PARTICIPANTS") participating interests in any Loan owing to such
Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or
any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents (in amounts
of not less than $5,000,000, or a lesser amount with the consent of
Borrower). In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating
interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan
Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the
holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes
under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under
this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such
participating interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.


CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 44
<PAGE>   51



12.2.2. Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right
to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other
than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or
Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives
principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees
payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, extends the
Revolving Credit Termination Date, postpones any date fixed for any
regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on,
any such Loan or Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or
releases all or substantially all of the collateral, if any, securing
any such Loan.

12.2.3. Benefit of Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in
Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing
under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the
Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of
setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of
participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to
share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each
Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of
setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if
each Participant were a Lender.

12.3.    Assignments.

12.3.1. Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("PURCHASERS") all
or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.
Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in
such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent
of the Borrower and the Agent shall be required prior to an assignment
becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or
an Affiliate thereof; provided, however, that if a Default has occurred
and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required.
Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each such
assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an
Affiliate thereof shall (unless each of the Borrower and the Agent
otherwise consents) be in an amount not less than the lesser of (i)
$5,000,000 or (ii) the remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
Commitment (calculated as at the date of such assignment) or
outstanding Loans (if the applicable Commitment has been terminated).

12.3.2. Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent
of an assignment, together with any consents required by Section
12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a $4,000 fee paid by the assigning Lender
or purchaser to the Agent for processing such assignment (unless such
fee is waived by the Agent), such assignment shall become effective on
the effective date specified in such assignment. The assignment shall
contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of
the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans
under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes "plan assets" as
defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser
in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA.
On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser
shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any
other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall
have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto,
and no further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the
Agent shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect
to the percentage of the

CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 45
<PAGE>   52

Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser. Upon the
consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section
12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall, if the
transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced
by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as
appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and
new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such
Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their
respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

12.4. Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "TRANSFEREE") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation any information contained in any Reports; provided that each
Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this
Agreement.

12.5. Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

ARTICLE XIII

NOTICES

13.1. Notices. Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.14 with
respect to borrowing notices, all notices, requests and other communications to
any party hereunder shall be in writing (including electronic transmission,
facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (x)
in the case of the Borrower or the Agent, at its address or facsimile number set
forth on the signature pages hereof, (y) in the case of any Lender, at its
address or facsimile number set forth below its signature hereto or (z) in the
case of any party, at such other address or facsimile number as such party may
hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the Borrower in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1. Each such notice, request
or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile
transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section
and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after
such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid,
addressed as aforesaid, or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered
(or, in the case of electronic transmission, received) at the address specified
in this Section; provided that notices to the Agent under Article II shall not
be effective until received.

13.2. Change of Address. The Borrower, the Agent and any Lender may
each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to
the other parties hereto.


CREDIT AGREEMENT (Clark/Bardes, Inc.)                                   Page 46
<PAGE>   53

ARTICLE XIV

COUNTERPARTS

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This
Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the
Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Agent by facsimile
transmission or telephone that it has taken such action.

ARTICLE XV

CHOICE OF LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL


15.1. CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS ( BUT WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS OR
PRINCIPLES) OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE
TO NATIONAL BANKS.

15.2. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS
TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR TEXAS STATE
COURT SITTING IN DALLAS, TEXAS IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT
ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A
COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT
THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER
IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER
AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER
INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED
TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN
DALLAS, TEXAS.

15.3. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER
HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY
WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

Item 1.01	ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. (“ICON”) announced on November 1, 2005 that it has replaced its existing $275 million credit agreement with a new $290 million credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement").  The New Credit Agreement provides for a five-year revolving line of credit of up to $250 million, including issuances of letters of credit, from time to time, and a five-year junior term loan of $40 million.  The New Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants customary in an agreement of this type.  At closing, the proceeds were used to refinance outstanding indebtedness under the previous credit agreement. In the future, it is anticipated that funds borrowed under the credit agreement will be used for general corporate purposes including working capital, capital expenditures, debt repayment or other corporate development activities.



Bank of America, N.A. serves as administrative agent, issuing lender and cash management bank for the credit agreement and Banc of America Securities LLC as lead arranger and book runner. Back Bay Capital Funding LLC serves as administrative agent for the junior term loan credit agreement

aggregate principal amount to be borrowed, and (D) whether the
borrowing shall be comprised of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar Loans or a
combination thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are requested, the
Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail to specify in
any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an applicable Interest Period in the
case of a Eurodollar Loan, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
request for an Interest Period of one month, or (II) the type of
Revolving Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
request for a Base Rate Loan hereunder. The Agent shall give notice to
each Lender promptly upon receipt of each Notice of Borrowing pursuant
to this Section 2.1(b)(i), the contents thereof and each such Lender's
share of any borrowing to be made pursuant thereto.

multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof.

(iii) Advances. Each Lender will make its Revolving
Commitment Percentage of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to
the Agent for the account of the Borrower as specified in Section
3.13(a), or in such other manner as the Agent may specify in writing,
by 1:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date specified in
the applicable Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and in funds immediately
available to the Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to
the Borrower by the Agent (i) by crediting the account of the Borrower
on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts made
available to the Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by
the Agent or (ii) as directed by the Borrower in writing in the
aggregate of the amounts made available to the Agent by the Lenders
and in like funds as received by the Agent.

Rate plus the Applicable Percentage;


22
<PAGE>   28

(ii)  Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as Revolving Loans
shall be comprised in whole or in part of Eurodollar Loans, such
Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.

Interest on Revolving Loans shall be payable in arrears on each
applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be

SECTION 3
OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

3.1      DEFAULT RATE.

Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2.5% greater than
the rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable,
whether in respect of interest, fees or other amounts, then 2.5% greater than
the Base Rate).

3.2      EXTENSION AND CONVERSION.

Subject to the terms of Section 5.2, the Borrower shall have the
option, on any Business Day, to extend existing Loans into a subsequent
permissible Interest Period or to convert Loans into Loans of another interest
rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as provided in Section 3.7,
Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) Eurodollar Loans may be extended,
and Base Rate Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Loans, only if no Default
or Event of Default is in existence on the date of extension or conversion and
the conditions set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 5.2 have
been satisfied, (iii) Loans extended as, or converted into, Eurodollar Loans
shall be subject to the terms of the definition of "Interest Period" set forth
in Section 1.1 and shall be in such minimum amounts as provided in Section
2.1(b)(ii), and (iv) any request for extension or conversion of a Eurodollar
Loan which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a
request for an Interest Period of one month. Each such extension or conversion
shall be effected by the Borrower by giving a Notice of Extension/Conversion
(or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Agent prior to 11:00
A.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day of, in the case of
the conversion of a Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan,


23
<PAGE>   29



and on the third Business Day prior to, in the case of the extension of a
Eurodollar Loan as, or conversion of a Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan,
the date of the proposed extension or conversion, specifying the date of the
proposed extension or conversion, the Loans to be so extended or converted, the
types of Loans into which such Loans are to be converted and, if appropriate,
the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto. Each request for
extension or conversion shall be irrevocable and shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower of the matters specified in
subsections (a) through (c) of Section 5.2. In the event the Borrower fails to
request extension or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan in accordance with this
Section, or any such conversion or extension is not permitted or required by
this Section, then such Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically converted into a
Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. The Agent
shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed
extension or conversion affecting any Loan.

3.3      PREPAYMENTS.

(a) Voluntary Prepayments. Loans may be repaid in whole or in
part without premium or penalty; provided that (i) Eurodollar Loans
may not be prepaid other than at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto and only then on three (3) Business Days' prior
written notice to the Agent, (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans
will be subject to Section 3.10, (iii) Base Rate Loans may be prepaid
by the Borrower by giving notice to the Agent prior to 11:00 a.m.
(Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date of the requested
prepayment, and (iv) each such partial prepayment shall be in a
minimum principal amount of $500,000, in the case of Eurodollar Loans,
and $500,000, in the case of Base Rate Loans, and in integral
multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. Any such voluntary
prepayments shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to
Eurodollar Loans in direct order of their Interest Period maturities.

(b) Mandatory Prepayments. If at any time, the aggregate
principal amount of Revolving Loans shall exceed the Revolving
Committed Amount, the Borrower shall immediately make payment on the
Revolving Loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficiency.
Any such mandatory prepayments shall be applied first to Base Rate
Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of their Interest
Period maturities. Amounts prepaid hereunder may be reborrowed in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

3.4      FEES.

(a) Unused Fee. In consideration of the Revolving Committed
Amount being made available by the Lenders, the Borrower agrees to pay
to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, an unused fee
(the "Unused Fee") equal to the Applicable Percentage for the Unused
Fee then in effect (calculated on the basis of actual number of days
elapsed in a year of 360 days) on the average daily unused portion of
the Revolving Committed Amount for the applicable period. The Unused
Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day following
the last day of each calendar quarter for the immediately preceding
quarter (or portion thereof) beginning with the first such date to
occur after the Closing Date.


24
<PAGE>   30


(b) Exit Fee. In the event the Borrower terminates the
Revolving Committed Amount on or before June 11, 1999, the Borrower
agrees to pay to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders,
an exit fee in the amount of $50,000.

3.5      CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

If any Lender has determined, after the date hereof, that the adoption
or the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof in the interpretation or
administration of, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital
adequacy, or compliance by such Lender with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or assets as a consequence
of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such
Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies with respect to
capital adequacy), then, upon notice from such Lender to the Borrower, the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction. Each determination
by any such Lender of amounts owing under this Section shall, absent manifest
error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

3.6      INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE.

If prior to the first day of any Interest Period, the Agent shall have
determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market,
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate
for such Interest Period, the Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice
thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If
such notice is given (a) any Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first
day of such Interest Period shall be made as Base Rate Loans and (b) any Loans
that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to or
continued as Eurodollar Loans shall be converted to or continued as Base Rate
Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Agent, no further Eurodollar
Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right
to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans.

3.7      ILLEGALITY.

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application
thereof occurring after the Closing Date shall make it unlawful for any Lender
to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Credit Agreement,
(a) such Lender shall promptly give written notice of such circumstances to the
Borrower and the Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn whenever such
circumstances no longer exist), (b) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to
make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert a Base
Rate Loan to Eurodollar Loans


25
<PAGE>   31


shall forthwith be canceled and, until such time as it shall no longer be
unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans, such Lender
shall then have a commitment only to make a Base Rate Loan when a Eurodollar
Loan is requested and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar
Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the
respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such
Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion
of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then
current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.10.

3.8      REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

If, after the date hereof, the adoption of or any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof applicable
to any Lender, or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority, in each case made subsequent to the Closing Date (or,
if later, the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender):

(a) shall subject such Lender to any tax of any kind
whatsoever with respect to any Eurodollar Loans made by it or its
obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or change the basis of taxation
of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for (i)
Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 3.9 (including Non-Excluded
Taxes imposed solely by reason of any failure of such Lender to comply
with its obligations under Section 3.9(b)) and (ii) changes in taxes
measured by or imposed upon the overall net income, or franchise tax
(imposed in lieu of such net income tax), of such Lender or its
applicable lending office, branch, or any affiliate thereof));

(b) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of,
advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other
acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender which is not
otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate
hereunder; or

(c) shall impose on such Lender any other condition
(excluding any tax of any kind whatsoever);

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting
into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any amount
receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, upon notice to
the Borrower from such Lender, through the Agent, in accordance herewith, the
Borrower shall be obligated to promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost
or reduced amount receivable, provided that, in any such case, the Borrower may
elect to convert the Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender hereunder to Base
Rate Loans by giving the Agent at least one Business Day's notice of such
election, in which case the Borrower shall promptly pay


26
<PAGE>   32


to such Lender, upon demand, without duplication, such amounts, if any, as may
be required pursuant to Section 3.10. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim
any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall provide prompt
notice thereof to the Borrower, through the Agent, certifying (x) that one of
the events described in this paragraph (a) has occurred and describing in
reasonable detail the nature of such event, (y) as to the increased cost or
reduced amount resulting from such event and (z) as to the additional amount
demanded by such Lender and a reasonably detailed explanation of the
calculation thereof. Such a certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this subsection submitted by such Lender, through the Agent, to the
Borrower shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto in the absence
of manifest error. This covenant shall survive for a period of one year the
termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

3.9      TAXES.

(a) Except as provided below in this subsection, all payments
made by the Borrower under this Credit Agreement and any Notes shall
be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or
on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings,
now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by
any court, or governmental body, agency or other official, excluding
taxes measured by or imposed upon the overall net income of any Lender
or its applicable lending office, or any branch or affiliate thereof,
and all franchise taxes, branch taxes, taxes on doing business or
taxes on the overall capital or net worth of any Lender or its
applicable lending office, or any branch or affiliate thereof, in each
case imposed in lieu of net income taxes, imposed: (i) by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender, applicable lending
office, branch or affiliate is organized or is located, or in which
its principal executive office is located, or any nation within which
such jurisdiction is located or any political subdivision thereof; or
(ii) by reason of any connection between the jurisdiction imposing
such tax and such Lender, applicable lending office, branch or
affiliate other than a connection arising solely from such Lender
having executed, delivered or performed its obligations, or received
payment under or enforced, this Credit Agreement or any Notes. If any
such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be
withheld from any amounts payable to the Agent or any Lender hereunder
or under any Notes, (A) the amounts so payable to the Agent or such
Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the
Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes)
interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or
in the amounts specified in this Credit Agreement and any Notes,
provided, however, that the Borrower shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold any Non-Excluded Taxes and shall not be required to increase
any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the
laws of the United States of America or a state thereof if such Lender
fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this
subsection whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the
Borrower, and (B) as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower
shall send to the Agent for its own account or for the account of such
Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official
receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the
Borrower fails


27
<PAGE>   33


to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Agent the required receipts or
other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the
Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties
that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of any
such failure. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the
termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof shall:

(X) (i)   on or before the date of any payment by the
Borrower under this Credit Agreement or Notes to such
Lender, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (A) two (2)
duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue
Service Form 1001 or 4224, or successor applicable form,
as the case may be, certifying that it is entitled to
receive payments under this Credit Agreement and any
Notes without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes and (B) an Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable form, as
the case may be, certifying that it is entitled to an
exemption from United States backup withholding tax;

(ii)  deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two (2)
further copies of any such form or certification on or
before the date that any such form or certification
expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of
any event requiring a change in the most recent form
previously delivered by it to the Borrower; and

(iii) obtain such extensions of time for filing and
complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably
be requested by the Borrower or the Agent; or

(Y) in the case of any such Lender that is not a "bank"
within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal
Revenue Code, (i) represent to the Borrower (for the
benefit of the Borrower and the Agent) that it is not a
bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Internal Revenue Code, (ii) agree to furnish to the
Borrower on or before the date of any payment by the
Borrower, with a copy to the Agent two (2) accurate and
complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8, or successor applicable form certifying
to such Lender's legal entitlement at the date of such
certificate to an exemption from U.S. withholding tax
under the provisions of Section 881(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code with respect to payments to be made under
this Credit Agreement and any Notes (and to deliver to the
Borrower and the Agent two (2) further copies of such form
on or before the date it expires or becomes obsolete and
after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in
the most recently provided form and, if necessary, obtain
any extensions of time reasonably


28
<PAGE>   34



requested by the Borrower or the Agent for filing and
completing such forms), and (iii) agree, to the extent
legally entitled to do so, upon reasonable request by the
Borrower, to provide to the Borrower (for the benefit of
the Borrower and the Agent) such other forms as may be
reasonably required in order to establish the legal
entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from
withholding with respect to payments under this Credit
Agreement and any Notes;

unless in any such case any change in treaty, law or regulation has
occurred after the date such Person becomes a Lender hereunder which
renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender
from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it
and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the Agent. Each Person
that shall become a Lender or a participant of a Lender pursuant to
subsection 11.3 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer,
be required to provide all of the forms, certifications and statements
required pursuant to this subsection, provided that in the case of a
participant of a Lender the obligations of such participant of a
Lender pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be determined as if the
participant of a Lender were a Lender except that such participant of
a Lender shall furnish all such required forms, certifications and
statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall
have been purchased.

3.10     INDEMNITY.

The Borrower promises to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender
harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur (other
than through such Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct) as a
consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion
into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice
requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Credit Agreement,
(b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan after
the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of
this Credit Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on
a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto.
With respect to Eurodollar Loans, such indemnification may include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued,
for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow,
convert or continue to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that
would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the
applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein over
(ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which
would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on
deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar
market. The covenants of the Borrower set forth in this Section 3.10 shall
survive for a period of one year the termination of this Credit Agreement and
the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

3.11     PRO RATA TREATMENT.

Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:


29
<PAGE>   35

(a) Loans. Each Extension of Credit in respect of Revolving
Loans and payments of principal, interest and fees (including the
Unused Fee) on or in respect thereof and each reduction in Revolving
Committed Amount, relating thereto, and each conversion or extension
of such Revolving Loans, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders
in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their
outstanding Revolving Loans and Participation Interests.

(b) Advances. Unless the Agent shall have been notified in
writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not
make the amount that would constitute its ratable share of such
borrowing available to the Agent, the Agent may assume that such
Lender is making such amount available to the Agent, and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower
a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the
Agent by such Lender within the time period specified therefor
hereunder, such Lender shall pay to the Agent, on demand, such amount
with interest thereon at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate for
the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available
to the Agent. A certificate of the Agent submitted to any Lender with
respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive
in the absence of manifest error.

3.12     SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender
shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other obligation owing to
such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under
Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest
arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by
any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided
for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the
other Lenders a participation in such Loans and other obligations in such
amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be
equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with
their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. The
Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by
such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien,
counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise
be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment
shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of
that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable with
respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or
otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a
participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights
of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or
other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Agent shall
fail to remit to the Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender
or the Agent to the Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit
Agreement on the date when such amount is

30
<PAGE>   36



due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date
from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the
Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate.
If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender
receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.12
applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in
respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the
Lenders under this Section 3.12 to share in the benefits of any recovery on
such secured claim.

3.13     PAYMENTS, COMPUTATIONS, ETC.

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all
payments hereunder shall be made to the Agent in dollars in
immediately available funds, without offset, deduction, counterclaim
or withholding of any kind, at the Agent's office specified in Section
11.1 not later than 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the
date when due. Payments received after such time shall be deemed to
have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment
which is not made by such time to any ordinary deposit account of the
Borrower maintained with the Agent (with notice to the Borrower). The
Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this Credit
Agreement, specify to the Agent the Loans, Fees, interest or other
amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to
be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, or if such
application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Agent
shall distribute such payment to the Lenders in such manner as the
Agent may determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing
by the Borrower hereunder, subject to the terms of Section 3.11(a)).
The Agent will distribute such payments to such Lenders, if such
payment is received prior to 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina
time) on a Business Day in like funds as received prior to the end of
such Business Day and otherwise the Agent will distribute such payment
to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any
payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and Fees for
the period of such extension), except that in the case of Eurodollar
Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next
following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on
the next preceding Business Day. Except as expressly provided
otherwise herein, all computations of interest and fees shall be made
on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days,
except with respect to computation of interest on Base Rate Loans
which (unless the Base Rate is determined by reference to the Federal
Funds Rate) shall be calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as
appropriate. Interest shall accrue from and include the date of
borrowing, but exclude the date of payment.

(b) Allocation of Payments After Event of Default.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the
contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Agent or any
Lender on account of the Loans or any other amounts outstanding under
any of the Credit Documents shall be paid over or delivered as
follows:



31
<PAGE>   37

FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees actually incurred) of the Agent in connection
with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under the Credit
Documents;

SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent;

THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees actually incurred) of each of the Lenders in
connection with enforcing its rights under the Credit
Documents or otherwise with respect to the Loans owing to
such Lender;

FOURTH, to the payment of all accrued interest and fees
on or in respect of the Loans;

FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount
of the Loans;

SIXTH, to all other obligations which shall have become
due and payable under the Credit Documents or otherwise and
not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above;
and

SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to
whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied
in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application
to the next succeeding category; and (ii) each of the Lenders shall
receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion
that the then outstanding Loans held by such Lender bears to the
aggregate then outstanding Loans) of amounts available to be applied
pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above.

3.14     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

(a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts
evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to
time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
to such Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each
Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its
account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts
from time to time, as necessary.

(b) The Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section
11.3(c) hereof, and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register
and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount,
type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount
of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and
payable


32
<PAGE>   38


to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Agent hereunder from or for the account of the Borrower and each
Lender's share thereof. The Agent will make reasonable efforts to
maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding
sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as
necessary.

(c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and
subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.14
(and, if consistent with the entries of the Agent, subsection (a))
shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that
the failure of any Lender or the Agent to maintain any such account,
such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein,
shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.

3.15     REPLACEMENT LENDERS.

At any time after the payment by the Borrower to any Lender of any
amount pursuant to Section 3.8 or 3.9 that the Borrower reasonably deems
material, the Borrower may, by writing addressed to the Agent and each Lender
that requested the payment of such amount, nominate or propose any bank or
other financial institution that is willing to become the assignee of the
Commitment and other obligations of such Lender (a "Replacement Lender")
pursuant to Section 11.3, and within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt
of such proposal from the Borrower, each such Lender shall execute and deliver
to the Agent an assignment agreement whereby such Lender shall assign its
entire Commitment in favor of the proposed Replacement Lender in accordance
with Section 11.3 unless, prior to the expiration of such period, the Agent
shall have notified the Borrower and such Lender that the proposed Replacement
Lender is not reasonably acceptable to the Agent; provided, that in no event
will (i) any Lender be required to enter into an Assignment Agreement at a
price less than par plus accrued interest and prorated fees and other costs due
hereunder to the effective date thereof, (ii) the Agent or any Lender be
obligated to assist the Borrower in identifying any bank or other financial
institution that is willing to become such a Replacement Lender or (iii) any
such assignment be required if the consummation thereof conflicts with any
Requirement of Law.

SECTION 4
GUARANTY

4.1      THE GUARANTEE.

Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, to each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement and
to the Agent as hereinafter provided the prompt payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise)
strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further
agree that if any of the Guaranteed Obligations are not paid in full when due
(whether at stated maturity, as




33
<PAGE>   39

a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as mandatory cash collateralization
or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the
same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any
extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity,
as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the
terms of such extension or renewal.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements, to the extent the
obligations of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable
for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state
or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the
obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount
that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state and
including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).

4.2      LOANS UNCONDITIONAL.

The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 hereof are joint
and several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value,
genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit
Documents or Hedging Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred
to therein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of
or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the
obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor
shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution
against the Borrower or any other Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations for
amounts paid under this Guaranty until such time as the Lenders (and any
Affiliates of Lenders entering into Hedging Agreements) have been paid in full,
all Commitments under the Credit Agreement have been terminated and no Person
or Governmental Authority shall have any right to request any return or
reimbursement of funds from the Lenders in connection with monies received
under the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or
impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute and
unconditional as described above:

(i)  at any time or from time to time, without notice to any
Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of
the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or
compliance shall be waived;

(ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement or any other
agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or Hedging
Agreements shall be done or omitted;



34
<PAGE>   40


(iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall
be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be
modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under
any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement or any other
agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or Hedging
Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or
exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

(iv)  any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Agent or any
Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations
shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

(v)   any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be determined to
be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of
any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims
of any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any
Guarantor).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices
whatsoever, and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender exhaust any right,
power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit
Documents, any Hedging Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred
to in the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements, or against any other Person
under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

4.3      REINSTATEMENT.

The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment
by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify
the Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration,
including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim
alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or
similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

4.4      REMEDIES.

The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Agent and the Lenders, on the
other hand, the Guaranteed Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Section 9.2 hereof (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section
9.2) for purposes of Section 4.1 hereof notwithstanding any stay, injunction or
other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Guaranteed
Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other
Person and that,


35
<PAGE>   41


in the event of such declaration (or the Guaranteed Obligations being deemed
to have become automatically due and payable), the Guaranteed Obligations
(whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due
and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of said Section 4.1.

4.5      RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

The Guarantors hereby agree, as among themselves, that if any
Guarantor shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as defined below), each
other Guarantor shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject
to the succeeding provisions of this Section 4.5), pay to such Excess Funding
Guarantor an amount equal to such Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as defined below
and determined, for this purpose, without reference to the properties, assets,
liabilities and debts of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of such Excess Payment
(as defined below). The payment obligation of any Guarantor to any Excess
Funding Guarantor under this Section 4.5 shall be subordinate and subject in
right of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of such
Guarantor under the other provisions of this Section 4, and such Excess Funding
Guarantor shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such excess
until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations. For purposes
hereof, (i) "Excess Funding Guarantor" shall mean, in respect of any
obligations arising under the other provisions of this Section 4 (hereafter,
the "Guarantied Obligations"), a Guarantor that has paid an amount in excess of
its Pro Rata Share of the Guarantied Obligations; (ii) "Excess Payment" shall
mean, in respect of any Guarantied Obligations, the amount paid by an Excess
Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guarantied
Obligations; and (iii) "Pro Rata Share", for the purposes of this Section 4.5,
shall mean, for any Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (a) the
amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable value of all of its assets
and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such
Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (b)
the amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable value of all assets and
other properties of the Borrower and all of the Guarantors exceeds the amount
of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated,
unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the
Borrower and the Guarantors hereunder) of the Borrower and all of the
Guarantors, all as of the Closing Date (if any Guarantor becomes a party hereto
subsequent to the Closing Date, then for the purposes of this Section 4.5 such
subsequent Guarantor shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor as of the Closing
Date and the information pertaining to, and only pertaining to, such Guarantor
as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be deemed true as of the
Closing Date).

4.6      CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

The guarantee in this Section 4 is a continuing guarantee, and shall
apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising. Each Guarantor further
agrees that until such time as the Lenders (and any Affiliates of Lenders
entering into Hedging Agreements) have been paid in full, all Commitments under
the Credit Agreement have been terminated and no Person or Governmental
Authority shall have any right to request any return or reimbursement of funds
from the Lenders in connection with monies received under the Credit Documents
or Hedging Agreement, no


36
<PAGE>   42


Guarantor shall enforce any rights provided it under any reimbursement or
guaranty agreement between or among such Guarantor and any of the other
Guarantors.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and to make

6.1      FINANCIAL CONDITION.

The financial statements delivered to the Agent pursuant to Section
5.1(b) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied

material respects and present fairly the financial condition and results from
operations of the entities and for the periods specified, subject in the case
of interim company-prepared statements to normal year-end adjustments.

6.2      NO CHANGES OR RESTRICTED PAYMENTS.

Since the date of the audited financial statements referenced

or other distributions have been declared, paid or made upon the capital stock
or other equity interest in a Credit Party, (ii) no capital stock or other

and authority, and the legal right to own and operate its property, to lease
the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is
currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign entity and in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing would not, in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect, and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law, except
to the extent that the failure to comply therewith would not, in the aggregate,
be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.4      POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE LOANS.

and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of
Law or Contractual Obligation other than the Liens arising under or

42
<PAGE>   48


reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No claim has been
asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any
such Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any such
Intellectual Property, nor does any Credit Party know of any such claim, and

any affiliate thereof hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents
to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and
creditworthiness of the Borrower or its Affiliates and made its own decision to
make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Credit Agreement. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals
and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement, and
to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions,
prospects and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Affiliates. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or

agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

10.7     INDEMNIFICATION.

The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent in its capacity as such (to
the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation
of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Commitments
(or if the Commitments have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the
respective principal amounts of outstanding Loans and Participation Interests
of the Lenders), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including without limitation at
any time following the final payment of all of the obligations of the Borrower
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to or
arising out of this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Agent. If any indemnity furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the
opinion of the Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call
for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified
against until such additional indemnity is furnished. The agreements in this
Section shall survive the repayment of the Loans, and other obligations under
the Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.

10.8     AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

The Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, its
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates as though the Agent were not the
Agent hereunder. With respect to the Loans made by and all obligations of the
Borrower hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the Agent shall have
the same rights and powers under this Credit Agreement as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.

10.9     SUCCESSOR AGENT.

The Agent may, at any time, resign upon twenty (20) days' written
notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the notice of resignation, then
the retiring Agent shall select a successor Agent provided such successor is a
Lender hereunder or a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State thereof and has a combined capital and
surplus of at least $400,000,000. Upon the acceptance of


64
<PAGE>   70


any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations as Agent, as appropriate, under this Credit
Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the provisions of this Section 10.9
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
while it was Agent under this Credit Agreement.

SECTION 11
MISCELLANEOUS

11.1     NOTICES.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other
communications shall have been duly given and shall be effective (i) when
delivered, (ii) when transmitted via telecopy (or other facsimile device) with
receipt confirmed, to the number set out below, (iii) the day following the day
on which the same has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight
air courier service, or (iv) the third Business Day following the day on which
the same is sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, in each case
to the respective parties at the address or telecopy numbers set forth on
Schedule 11.1 or at such other address as such party may specify by written
notice to the other parties hereto.

11.2     RIGHT OF SET-OFF.

In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable
law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, each Lender is authorized at any time and
from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind (all of which rights being hereby expressly waived), to set-off and to
appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other
indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender (including, without
limitation branches, agencies or Affiliates of such Lender wherever located) to
or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against obligations and
liabilities of such Person to such Lender hereunder, under the Notes, the other
Credit Documents or otherwise, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have
made any demand hereunder and although such obligations, liabilities or claims,
or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured, and any such set-off shall be
deemed to have been made immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
even though such charge is made or entered on the books of such Lender
subsequent thereto. Any Person purchasing a participation in the Loans and
Commitments hereunder pursuant to Section 3.12 or Section 11.3(d) may exercise
all rights of set-off with respect to its participation interest as fully as if
such Person were a Lender hereunder.

11.3     BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT.

(a) Generally. This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective
successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided that the
Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its


65
<PAGE>   71


interests without prior written consent of the Lenders; provided
further that the rights of each Lender to transfer, assign or grant
participations in its rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be
limited as set forth in this Section 11.3, provided however that
nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from (i) pledging
its Loans hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings
made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank, or (ii) granting
assignments or selling participations in such Lender's Loans and/or
Commitments hereunder to its parent company and/or to any Affiliate or
Subsidiary of such Lender.

(b) Assignments. Each Lender may assign all or a portion of
its rights and obligations hereunder, pursuant to an assignment
agreement substantially in the form of Schedule 11.3(b), to (i) any
Lender or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of a Lender, or (ii) any other
commercial bank, financial institution or "accredited investor" (as
defined in Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission)
reasonably acceptable to the Agent and, so long as no Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower; provided that
(i) any such assignment (other than any assignment to an existing
Lender) shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (or, if
less, the remaining amount of the Commitment being assigned by such
Lender) of the Commitments and in integral multiples of $1,000,000
above such amount and (ii) each such assignment shall be of a
constant, not varying, percentage of all such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Credit Agreement. Any assignment hereunder
shall be effective upon delivery to the Agent of written notice of the
assignment together with a transfer fee of $3,500 payable to the Agent
for its own account from and after the later of (i) the effective date
specified in the applicable assignment agreement and (ii) the date of
recording of such assignment in the Register pursuant to the terms of
subsection (c) below. The assigning Lender will give prompt notice to
the Agent and the Borrower of any such assignment. Upon the
effectiveness of any such assignment (and after notice to, and (to the
extent required pursuant to the terms hereof), with the consent of,
the Borrower as provided herein), the assignee shall become a "Lender"
for all purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit
Documents and, to the extent of such assignment, the assigning Lender
shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent of the
Loans and Commitment components being assigned. Along such lines the
Borrower agrees that upon notice of any such assignment and surrender
of the appropriate Note or Notes, it will promptly provide to the
assigning Lender and to the assignee separate promissory notes in the
amount of their respective interests substantially in the form of the
original Note (but with notation thereon that it is given in
substitution for and replacement of the original Note or any
replacement notes thereof). By executing and delivering an assignment
agreement in accordance with this Section 11.3(b), the assigning
Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as
follows: (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and
beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear
of any adverse claim; (ii) except as set forth in clause (i) above,
such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes
no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or
representations made in or in connection with this Credit Agreement,
any of the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or


66
<PAGE>   72

thereto, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Credit Agreement, any of the
other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto or thereto or the financial condition of the Borrower
or any of its Affiliates or the performance or observance by the
Borrower of any of its obligations under this Credit Agreement, any of
the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (iii) such assignee represents
and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into such
assignment agreement; (iv) such assignee confirms that it has received
a copy of this Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such assignment
agreement; (v) such assignee will independently and without reliance
upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not
taking action under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit
Documents; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to
take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it
will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which
by the terms of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents
are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

(c) Maintenance of Register. The Agent shall maintain at one
of its offices in Charlotte, North Carolina a copy of each Lender's
assignment agreement delivered to it in accordance with the terms of
subsection (b) above and a register for the recordation of the
identity of the principal amount, type and Interest Period of each
Loan outstanding hereunder, the names, addresses and the Commitments
of the Lenders pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
"Register"). The Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the
accuracy of the Register and to promptly update the Register from time
to time, as necessary. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
in the absence of manifest error and the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Credit Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection
by the Borrower and each Lender, at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d) Participations. Each Lender may sell, transfer, grant or
assign participations in all or any part of such Lender's interests
and obligations hereunder; provided that (i) such selling Lender shall
remain a "Lender" for all purposes under this Credit Agreement (such
selling Lender's obligations under the Credit Documents remaining
unchanged) and the participant shall not constitute a Lender
hereunder, (ii) no such participant shall have, or be granted, rights
to approve any amendment or waiver relating to this Credit Agreement
or the other Credit Documents except to the extent any such amendment
or waiver would (A) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on or
Fees in respect of any Loans in


67
<PAGE>   73

which the participant is participating or (B) postpone the date fixed
for any payment of principal (including extension of the Maturity Date
or the date of any mandatory prepayment), interest or Fees in which
the participant is participating, and (iii) sub-participations by the
participant (except to an affiliate, parent company or affiliate of a
parent company of the participant) shall be prohibited. In the case of
any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights
under this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents (the
participant's rights against the selling Lender in respect of such
participation to be those set forth in the participation agreement
with such Lender creating such participation) and all amounts payable
by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had
not sold such participation, provided, however, that such participant
shall be entitled to receive additional amounts under Sections 3.7,
3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 on the same basis as if it were a Lender.

11.4     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document and no course of dealing between the Agent or any Lender and the
Borrower shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and
remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which the Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or
demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action
in any circumstances without notice or demand.

11.5     PAYMENT OF EXPENSES, ETC.

The Borrower agrees to: (i) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (A) of the Agent in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery and administration of this Credit Agreement and the
other Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to therein
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of Moore & Van
Allen, PLLC, special counsel to the Agent, subject to the limitation contained
in a separate agreement between the Agent and the Borrower) and any amendment,
waiver or consent relating hereto and thereto including, but not limited to,
any such amendments, waivers or consents resulting from or related to any
work-out, renegotiation or restructure relating to the performance by the
Borrower under this Credit Agreement and (B) after the occurrence of a Default
or Event of Default, of the Agent and the Lenders in connection with
enforcement of the Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred
to therein (including, without limitation, in connection with any such
enforcement, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agent and
each of the Lenders); (ii) pay and hold each of the Lenders harmless from and
against any and all present and future stamp and other similar taxes with
respect to the foregoing matters and save each of the Lenders harmless from and
against any and all liabilities


68
<PAGE>   74

with respect to or resulting from any delay or omission (other than to
the extent attributable to such Lender) to pay such taxes; and (iii)
indemnify each Lender, its officers, directors, employees,
representatives and Agents from and hold each of them harmless against
any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred
by any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way
related to, or by reason of (A) any investigation, litigation or other
proceeding (whether or not any Lender is a party thereto) related to
the entering into and/or performance of any Credit Document or the use
of proceeds of any Loans (including other extensions of credit)
hereunder or the consummation of any other transactions contemplated
in any Credit Document, including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such
investigation, litigation or other proceeding or (B) the presence or
Release of any Materials of Environmental Concern at, under or from
any Property owned, operated or leased by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or the failure by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries to comply with any Environmental Law (but excluding, in
the case of either of clause (A) or (B) above, any such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by
reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Person to be indemnified).

11.6     AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS.

Neither this Credit Agreement nor any of the other Credit Documents,
nor any of the terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived,
discharged or terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or
termination is in writing entered into by, or approved in writing by, the
Required Lenders and the Borrower, provided, however, that:

(a) no such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or
termination shall, without the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby, (i) reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
interest (other than as a result of waiving the applicability of any
post-default increase in interest rates) on any Loan or fees
hereunder, (ii) extend (A) the Commitments of the Lenders, or (B) the
final maturity of any Loan, or any portion thereof, or (iii) reduce
the principal amount on any Loan;

(b) no such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or
termination shall, without the consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (i) increase the Commitments of the Lenders over the amount
thereof in effect (it being understood and agreed that a waiver of any
Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the total
commitments shall not constitute a change in the terms of any
Commitment of any Lender), (ii) release all or substantially all of
the Collateral, (iii) release all or substantially all of the
Guarantors from the Guaranty Obligations hereunder (iv) amend, modify
or waive any provision of this Section 11.6 or Section 3.5, 3.9, 3.10,
3.11, 3.12, 9.1(a), 11.2, 11.3, 11.5 or 11.9, (v) reduce any
percentage specified in, or otherwise modify, the definition of
"Required Lenders," or (vi) consent to the assignment or transfer by
the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under (or in respect
of) the Credit Documents to which it is a party; and

(c) and no provision of Section 10 may be amended without the
consent of the Agent.

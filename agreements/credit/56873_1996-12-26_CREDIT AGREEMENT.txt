relative to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, as requested by
the Borrower, that such Lender would be willing to accept
for such Auction Bid Advance  and such Lender's Applicable
Lending Office with respect to such Auction Bid Advance,
provided that, if the Agent in its capacity as a Lender
shall, in its sole  discretion, elect to make any such offer,
it shall notify the Borrower of such offer before 15
minutes prior to the Borrower's deadline specified in
paragraph (A) above on the date on which notice of such
election is to be given  to the Agent by the other Lenders.
If any Lender shall elect not to make such an offer, such Lender
shall so notify the Agent, before such time as is specified in the
Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing on the date on which
notice of such election is to be given to the Borrower or
the Agent, as the case may be, by the other Lenders, and
such Lender shall not be obligated to, and shall not,
make any Auction Bid Advance as part of such Auction Bid
Borrowing, provided that the failure by any Lender to
give such notice shall not cause such Lender to be
obligated to make any Auction Bid Advance as part of such
proposed Auction Bid Borrowing.

(C)  The Borrower (either directly or through the
Agent) shall, in turn, before such time and date as is
specified in the Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing, either

(x) cancel such Auction Bid Borrowing by giving
the Lenders who received notice pursuant to
paragraph (A) above notice to that effect, or

(y) accept one or more of the offers (or
portions of such offers) made by any Lender or
Lenders pursuant to paragraph (B) above, in its sole
discretion, by giving notice to the applicable Lender
or Lenders of the amount of each Auction
Bid Advance to be made by each Lender as part of
such Auction Bid Borrowing, with simultaneous notice
thereof to the Agent, and reject any remaining
offers made by Lenders pursuant to paragraph (B)
above by giving them notice to that effect.

(D)  If the Borrower notifies the Agent that such
Auction Bid Borrowing is canceled pursuant to paragraph
(C)(x) above, the Borrower or the Agent, as the case
may be, shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders
and such Auction Bid Borrowing shall not be made.

(E)  If the Borrower accepts one or more of the
offers (or portions of such offers) made by any Lender or
Lenders pursuant to paragraph (C)(y) above, the Borrower
or the Agent, as the case may be, shall in turn promptly
notify each Lender that is to make an Auction Bid Advance
as part of such Auction Bid Borrowing, of the amount of
each Auction Bid Advance to be made by such Lender as
part of such Auction Bid Borrowing.

(ii) Each Lender that is to make an Auction Bid
Advance as part of an Auction Bid Borrowing shall, before
12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date of such Auction
Bid Borrowing specified in the Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing
relating thereto, make available for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office to the Agent in immediately
available funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Auction
Bid Borrowing.  Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions
set forth in Article 4 and after receipt by the Agent of such
funds, the Agent will make such funds available to the
Borrower in like funds as received.  Promptly after each
Auction Bid Borrowing, the Agent will notify each Lender of
the amount of the Auction Bid Borrowing.

(iii) Each Auction Bid Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate principal amount of not less than $1,000,000.
Following the making of each Auction Bid Borrowing, the
Borrower shall be in compliance with the limitations set forth
in the proviso to the first sentence of subsection (i) above.

(iv) Within the limits and on the conditions set
forth in this Section 2.01(b), the Borrower may from time to
time borrow under this Section 2.01(b), repay or prepay pur-
suant to subsection (v) below, and reborrow under this Section
2.01(b).

(v)  The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the
account of each Lender that has made, or holds the right to
repayment of, an Auction Bid Advance on the maturity date of
each Auction Bid Advance (such maturity date being that
specified by the Borrower for repayment of such Auction Bid
Advance in the related Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (ii)(A) above) the
then-unpaid principal amount of such Auction Bid Advance.  The
Borrower shall not have any right to prepay any principal
amount of any Auction Bid Advance unless, and then only on the
terms, specified by the Borrower for such Auction Bid Advance
in the related Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing delivered
pursuant to subsection (ii)(A) above.

(vi) The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Auction Bid Advance from and
including the date of such Auction Bid Advance to but
excluding the date the principal amount of such Auction Bid
Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such
Auction Bid Advance (including any rate specified for past due
amounts) specified by the Lender making such Auction Bid
Advance in its notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant
to subsection (i)(B) above, payable on the interest payment
date or dates specified by the Borrower for such Auction Bid
Advance in the related Notice of Auction Bid Borrowing
delivered pursuant to subsection (i)(A) above.

(vii) In respect of any Auction Bid Borrowing
accepted by the Borrower, the Borrower shall indemnify each
Lender whose bid has been accepted, in whole or in part,
against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender
solely as a result of any failure by the Borrower to borrow on
the date specified in the Auction Bid Notice of Borrowing for
such Auction Bid Borrowing, including any loss (including loss
of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Lender to fund such Auction Bid Borrowing
when such Auction Bid Borrowing to be made by such Lender,
solely as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
Without prejudice to the survival of any other provision of
this Agreement, the provisions of this paragraph shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.02.  Making the Advances.

(a)  Each Borrowing (other than an Auction Bid Borrowing)
consisting of Advances (a "Borrowing") shall be made on notice
(a "Notice of Borrowing"), given by the Borrower to the Agent
not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on (i) if such
Advances are Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, the third
Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing or
(ii) if such Advances are Base Rate Advances, the Business Day
prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing.  The Agent shall
give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telex, telecopier
or cable, confirmed promptly thereafter in writing.  Such
Notice of Borrowing shall be by telex, telecopier or cable, in
substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 or in such other form as
the Agent and the Borrower may agree upon, specifying therein
the Borrower and the requested (A) date of the proposed
Borrowing, (B) Type of Advances comprising the proposed
Borrowing, (C) amount of the proposed Borrowing, (D) Interest
Period for the proposed Borrowing if such Borrowing is
comprised of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances and (E)
additional information set forth in Exhibit A-1, as the case
may be.  If the proposed Borrowing is comprised of Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower and each Lender of the applicable interest rate under
Section 2.06. Each Lender shall, before 11:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on the date of the Borrowing, make available for
the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at
the Agent's address referred to in Section 9.01, or at such
other address and account as shall be designated by the Agent
in writing to the Lenders, in immediately available funds,
such Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowing.  After the
Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
conditions set forth in Article 4, the Agent will make such
funds available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid
address in like funds as received.

(b)  Anything in Section 2.08 to the contrary
notwithstanding:

(i)  if the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate is then being
determined by reference to rates affected by the
Reference Banks and if fewer than two Reference Banks
furnish timely information to the Agent for determining
the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Advances,

(A)  the Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrower
and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be
determined for such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances;

(B)  each such Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,
Convert into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is
then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate
Advance); and

(C)  the obligations of the Lenders to make, or to
Convert Advances into, Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing
such suspension no longer exist;

(ii) if, with respect to any Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Advances, Majority Lenders shall notify the Agent
that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period
for such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances will not
adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
funding their respective Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall
forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders,
whereupon

(A)  each such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, on the last day of the then-existing
Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance
(or, if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will
continue as a Base Rate Advance), and

(B)  the obligations of the Lenders to make, or to
Convert Advances into, Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing
such suspension no longer exist; and

(iii) if the Borrower shall select an Interest
Period of six months for any Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances and any Lender shall notify the Agent that the
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period will
not adequately reflect the cost to such Lender of making or
funding its Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance for such
Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the
Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon

(A)  each such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing
Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance
(or, if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will
continue as a Base Rate Advance), and,

(B)  the  obligations of the Lenders to make, or to
Convert Advances into, Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
having an Interest Period of six months shall be
suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and
such Lenders that the circumstances causing such  suspension
no longer exist.

(c)  Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
binding on the Borrower and, in respect of any Borrowing
comprised of or including Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
specified in such Notice of Borrowing, the Borrower shall
indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense
incurred by such Lender solely as a result of any failure by
the Borrower to borrow on the date specified in the Notice of
Borrowing for such Borrowing, including any loss (including
loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by
reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other
funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Adjusted  Eurodollar
Rate Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such
Borrowing when such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance, solely
as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.
Without prejudice to the survival of any other provision of
this Agreement, the provisions of this paragraph shall survive
any termination of this Agreement.

(d)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing (other than an
Auction Bid Borrowing) that such Lender will not make
available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing
in accordance with this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in
reliance on such assumption, make available to the Borrower on
such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent such
Lender shall not have made available to the Agent on the date
of any Borrowing such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, such Lender agrees, and the Borrower agrees, to pay
or repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount
is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount
is paid or repaid to the Agent, at (in the case of such
Lender) the Federal Funds Rate and (in the case of the
Borrower) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage
(provided that such payment at the Federal Funds Rate or the
Base Rate (plus the Applicable Percentage) with respect to any
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance shall not affect the status
of such Advance as an Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance).  If
such Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount, the amount so
paid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such
Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement from and including
the date of such Borrowing.

(e)  The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be
made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its
Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any
Borrowing.

SECTION 2.03.  Fees

(a)  Facility Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Agent for distribution to each Lender a facility fee (the
"Facility Fee") with respect to such Lender's Commitment, at a
rate per annum equal to the Applicable Percentage from time to
time in effect on the aggregate amount of such Lender's
Commitment, regardless of usage.  The Facility Fees will
commence to accrue on the date of execution of this Agreement
and will be payable in arrears on (i) on the third day of each
January, April, July and October and (ii) on the Termination
Date.

(b)  Agent's Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Agent the annual Agent's fees set forth in the separate letter
from the Agent to the Borrower dated October 15, 1996.

SECTION 2.04.  Termination or Reduction of Facilities.

(a)  The Commitments shall be automatically terminated on
the Termination Date.

(b)  The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least
three Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, to
terminate in whole, or reduce ratably in part (in minimum
principal amounts of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof), the unused portion of the
Facility (such unused portion having been determined after
subtracting the Facility Usage from the Facility).

SECTION 2.05.  Repayment of Advances.

(a)  Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for
the account of the Lenders the aggregate principal amount of
the Advances (other than Auction Bid Advances) then
outstanding on the Termination Date.

(b)  Auction Bid Advances. The Borrower shall repay the
aggregate principal amount of the Auction Bid Advances to the
applicable Lenders in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.01(b)(v).

SECTION 2.06.  Interest.

The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal
amount of each Advance made by each Lender from the date of
such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in
full, at the following rates per annum:

(a)  Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such
Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all
times to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the
Applicable Percentage, payable quarterly in arrears on the
third day of each January, April, July and October and on the
date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted into an
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance or paid in full; provided
that commencing on the date and during the continuance of any
Event of Default the applicable interest rate for all
outstanding Base Rate Advances shall be a rate per annum equal
at all times to 2% per annum above the rate otherwise in
effect for such Base Rate Advances pursuant to this Section
2.06(a) from time to time and such interest shall be payable
on demand.

(b)  Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such
periods as such Advance is an Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each
Interest Period for such Advance to the Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Percentage,
payable on the last day of each Interest Period and, if such
Interest Period has a duration of six months, on each day that
occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the
first day of such Interest Period, provided that commencing on
the date and during the continuance of any Event of Default
the applicable interest rate for all outstanding Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be a rate per annum equal at
all times to 2% per annum above the rate otherwise in effect
for such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances pursuant to this
Section 2.06(b) and such interest shall be payable on demand.

SECTION 2.07.  Interest Rate Determination.

(a)  In the event that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate is
then being determined by reference to rates offered by the
Reference Banks, each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the
Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.  If any one or more of the Reference
Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Agent
for the purpose of determining any such interest rate (but at
least two Reference Banks shall have furnished such
information), the Agent shall determine such interest rate on
the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining
Reference Banks.

(b)  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower
and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by
the Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a) or (b), and the
applicable rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for
the purpose of determining the applicable interest rate under
Section 2.06(b).

(c)  If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of
any Interest Period for any Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition
of the term "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Agent will
forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and such
Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then
existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate
Advances (or, if such Advances are then Base Rate Advances,
will continue as Base Rate Advances).

SECTION 2.08.  Conversion of Advances.

(a)  The Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice
given to the Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the
proposed Conversion, and subject to the provisions of Sections
2.02(c), 2.06, 2.07, 2.08(d) and 2.10(c), Convert all or any
Advances (except Auction Bid Advances) of one Type into Ad-
vances of the other Type; provided, however, that (i) except
as provided in Section 2.10(c), any Conversion of any Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made
on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances and (ii) the Borrower may
not Convert any Base Rate Advances into Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Advances unless such Base Rate Advances are in an
aggregate amount not less than $1,000,000.  Each such notice
of a Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified
above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion, (ii) the Type
and aggregate amount of Advances to be Converted and (iii) if
such Conversion is into Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
duration of the Interest Period for such Advances.

(b)  Each notice of Conversion shall be irrevocable and
binding on the Borrower and, in respect of any notice of
Conversion to Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower
shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense
incurred by such Lender solely as a result of any failure to
Convert on the date specified in such notice, including any
loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance to be made by such Lender as
part of such Conversion when such Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advance, solely as a result of such failure, is not made on
such date.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other
provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this paragraph
shall survive any termination of this Agreement

(c)  On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances having the same
Interest Period shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or
otherwise, to less than $1,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

(d)  Upon the occurrence of any Default and so long as
such Default shall continue, the right of the Borrower to
Convert any Advance into an Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advance
shall be suspended.

SECTION 2.09.  Prepayments.

(a)  Optional Prepayment. The Borrower may, upon at least
three Business Days' notice in the case of Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Advances, and upon at least one Business Day's notice in
the case of Base Rate Advances, to the Agent stating the
proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the
prepayment, (and if such notice is given the Borrower shall)
prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances in
whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to
the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid
and all fees, costs and expenses otherwise payable by the
Borrower under this Agreement with respect to the principal
amount prepaid; provided, however, that:

(i)  each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.09(a)
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of not less than
$1,000,000 or, if less, the outstanding principal amount
of such Advances; and

(ii) in the case of any such prepayment of an Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advance, such prepayment shall either be made
on the last day of an Interest Period for such Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advance or shall be made together with the
payment of all amounts required pursuant to Section 9.05(c).

(b)  Mandatory Prepayments. (i) The Borrower shall, on
each Business Day, prepay Advances comprising part of the same
Borrowings in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
amount by which (A) the Facility Usage exceeds (B) the
Facility.

(ii) All prepayments by the Borrower under this
subsection (b) shall be made together with accrued interest to
the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid
and shall be applied first against the Advances to be prepaid
under the Facility that are Base Rate Advances and thereafter
against the Advances to be prepaid under the Facility that are
Eurodollar Advances having Interest Periods ending as close as
possible to the date of such Prepayment.

SECTION 2.10.  Increased Costs; Illegality.

(a)  If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any
change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase
of reserve requirements included in the Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate Reserve Percentage) in or change in the interpretation of
any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of
law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower shall from time to
time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand
to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for
such increased cost.  A certificate as to the amount of such
increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by
such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.


(b)  If any Lender determines that compliance with any
law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having
the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender
or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount
of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of
such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other
commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender
(with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrower shall
pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to
time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender in the light of such
circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably
determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the
existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder.  A
certificate as to such amounts, submitted to the Borrower and
the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error.

(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it
unlawful, as determined by any Lender, or any central bank or
other Governmental Authority shall assert that it is unlawful,
for such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform
its obligations hereunder to make Adjusted Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof
and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrower through the
Agent, (i) the obligation of such Lender to make Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances and to Convert Advances into Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall terminate and (ii) the Borrower
shall forthwith Convert all Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
of such Lender then outstanding into Base Rate Advances in
accordance with Section 2.08, except that such Conversion may
occur, notwithstanding Section 2.08, other than on the last
day of the respective Interest Periods for such Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advances, if the Borrower has paid all amounts
payable under Section 9.05(c).

SECTION 2.11.  Payments and Computations.

(a)  The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder
without set-off or counterclaim not later than Noon (New York
City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at
One Wall Street, New York, New York 10286, in immediately
available funds. the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to
be distributed (i) like funds relating to the payment of
principal, interest or Facility Fees ratably (other than
amounts payable (A) to a Lender in respect of any Auction Bid
Advance, or (B) pursuant to Sections 2.03(b), 2.10, 2.13 or
9.05) to the Lenders for the account of their Applicable
Lending Offices and (ii) like funds relating to the payment of
any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the
account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be
applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(b)  The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and
to the extent payment is not made when due hereunder, to
charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower's
accounts with such Lender any amount so due to such Lender
prior to any sharing under Section 2.12.  Nothing contained in
this subsection (b) shall impair the obligations of any lender
under Section 2.12, the rights of the Agent or any Lender
under Section 9.06 or any other rights and remedies (including
other rights of set-off) that the Agent or such Lender may
have.

(c)  All computations of interest based on the Base Rate,
the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, any Fixed Rate or the Federal
Funds Rate, and of Facility Fees shall be made by the Agent on
the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual
number of days (including the first day but excluding the last
day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees
are payable; provided, however, that all computations of
interest based on the Base Rate when the Base Rate is
determined by reference to the BNY Rate shall be made by the
Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
applicable, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring
in the period for which such interest is payable.  Each
determination by the Agent of an interest rate or fee
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

(d)  Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be
due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension
of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; provided,
however, that if such extension would cause payment of
interest on or principal of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Advances
to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment
shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(e)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment
in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such
payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to
each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount
then due such Lender.

If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so
made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall
repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until
the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the
Federal Funds Rate.

SECTION 2.12.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.

If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether
voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances made by it
(other than pursuant to Sections 2.03(b), 2.10, 2.13 or 9.05
and other than amounts payable to a Lender in respect of an
Auction Bid Advance) in excess of its ratable share of
payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the
Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other
Lenders such participations in the Advances made by the other
Lenders as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender
to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that, if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender,
such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each
such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an
amount equal to such other Lender's ratable share (according
to the proportion of (a) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total
amount so recovered.  The Borrower agrees that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to
this Section 2.12 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of
setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

SECTION 2.13.  Taxes.

(a)  Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall
be made, in accordance with Section 2.11, free and clear of
and without deduction for any and all current or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all
liabilities with respect thereto (including interest,
additions to tax, and penalties thereon) imposed by the United
States of America or any political subdivision thereof (or, in
the event that the Borrower assigns any of its rights or
obligations or any interest hereunder, by any foreign country
and its political subdivisions in which the assignee is
incorporated or is resident), excluding, in the case of each
Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on or measured by its net
income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction
under the laws of which the Agent or such Lender (as the case
may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and,
in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on or measured by
its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any
political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").  If the
Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the
Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.13) such Lender or the Agent (as the case
may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower
shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or
other authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b)  In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any current
or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any
payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement
(hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c)  The Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including
any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 2.13) paid by such Lender
or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
interest, expenses, additions to tax, and penalties) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.  Payments
under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes
written demand therefor.  However, in the case of any Taxes
not required by law to be deducted by the Borrower from or in
respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the
Agent, payment under this indemnification must be made by the
Borrower only if such written demand has been made within 60
days from the date on which such Lender or the Agent, as the
case may be, makes payment of the Taxes to the relevant taxing
authority.

(d)  Within 30 days after the reasonable request therefor
by th Agent in connection with any payment of Taxes or Other
Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent, at its address
referred to in, or determined pursuant to, Section 9.01, the
original or a certified copy of an official receipt from the
jurisdiction to which payment is made evidencing payment
thereof or, if unavailable, a certificate from the Borrower's
treasurer or responsible officer that states that such payment
has been made and that sets forth the date and amount of such
payment.

(e)  Prior to or on the Effective Date in the case of
each Lender that is a Lender on the Effective Date, and on the
date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it
became a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from
time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Agent, each Lender organized under the laws of
a foreign jurisdiction that is exempt from United States
Federal withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax at a
reduced rate under an applicable treaty, with respect to
payments under this Agreement has provided or is herewith
providing the Borrower or the Agent with an Internal Revenue
Form 4224 or Form 1001 or other certificate or document
required under United States law to establish entitlement to
such exemption or reduced rate.  Such form, certificate or
document will be provided by each such Lender from time to
time after the Effective Date as reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Agent.  A determination of whether a Lender is
exempt from United States Federal withholding tax or is
subject to such tax at a reduced rate shall be within the
reasonable judgment of the Lender.

(f)  Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.13
shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest
hereunder.

SECTION 2.14.  Evidence of Debt Under This Agreement.

(a)  Lender's Records. Each Lender will note on its
internal records with respect to each Advance made by it: (i)
the date and amount of such Advance, (ii) the character of
such Advance, as a Base Rate Advance, a Eurodollar Advance or
an Auction Bid Advance, (iii) the Interest Period and the
interest rate (without regard to the Applicable Margin)
applicable to Eurodollar Advances or Auction Bid Advances and
(iv) each payment and prepayment of the principal of each
Advance.

(b)  Agent's Records. The Agent shall keep records
regarding the Advances and this Agreement in accordance with
its customary procedures for agented credits.

(c)  Prima Facie Evidence. The entries made in the
records maintained pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above
shall be, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law,
prima facie evidence of the existence and amount of the
obligations of the Borrower recorded therein absent manifest
error; provided that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to
make any notation on its records shall not affect the
Borrower's obligations in respect of the Advances or this
Agreement.

(d)  Notes. Upon the request of any Lender (in connection
with a proposed assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank as
contemplated by Section 9.04(g)) to the Agent and the
Borrower, the Borrower agrees, at its expense, to execute and
deliver to the Agent for the account of such Lender one or
more promissory notes evidencing the Advance or Advances of
such Lender to the Borrower, substantially in the form of
Exhibit G hereto.

SECTION 2.15.  Use of Proceeds.

The proceeds of the Advances shall be used by the
Borrower to finance the working capital needs of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries and for other general corporate purposes
of the Borrower (including the funding of the Borrower's and
its Subsidiaries' voluntary employees' beneficiary association
trusts).

SECTION 2.16.  Extensions

(a)  Provided that no Default or Event of Default exists
during the periods set forth below, the Borrower may request
that the Termination Date be extended for additional 364 day
periods by delivering an Extension Request to the Agent during
the period not more than 90 days but not less than 30 days
prior to the then applicable Termination Date, and, upon the
receipt of such notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender thereof.  If each Lender consents to an Extension
Request during the Extension Consent Period by giving written
notice thereof to the Borrower and the Agent, then, effective
on the first day of the Extension Consent Period, the then
applicable Termination Date shall be extended by 364 days from
and including such first day of such Extension Consent Period,
provided, however, that if the 364th day falls on a day other
than a Business Day, such extended Termination Date shall be
the Business Day immediately preceding such 364th day. Subject
to subsection (b) below, in the event that any Lender shall
not have granted its consent to an Extension Request, the then
current Termination Date shall remain in effect.  Each Lender
shall endeavor to respond to each Extension Request during the
Extension Consent Period, provided that each Lender which
shall have failed so to respond by such time shall be deemed
not to have consented thereto.  In the event that the Agent
receives notice from a Lender that such Lender declines to
grant an Extension Request, the Agent shall notify the
Borrower thereof.

(b)  Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a)
above to the contrary, in the event Lenders having Commitments
equal to or more than 66 2/3% of the Facility desire to extend
the Termination Date pursuant to subsection (a) above (the
"Continuing Lenders"), the Borrower shall have the right,
provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and be con-
tinuing, to replace or remove any Lender that does not desire
to extend the Termination Date (a "Non-Extending Lender") by
giving the Agent notice, no later than 20 days after the last
day of the applicable Extension Consent Period, of its intent
to extend the Termination Date.  On or prior to the then
current Termination Date, the Borrower shall, with respect to
each Non-Extending Lender, either (i) reduce the Facility to
an amount equal to the amount of the Commitments of the
Continuing Lenders but not below $50,000,000 and pay to the
Agent for the account of such Non-Extending Lender all
principal and interest and other amounts owing to such
Non-Extending Lender under this Agreement (in which case the
Commitment of such Non-Extending Lender shall automatically
terminate), or (ii) replace such Non-Extending Lender.  In
the event of a replacement of a Non-Extending Lender, such
Non-Extending Lender agrees to assign all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee selected by
the Borrower with the consent of the Agent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) upon payment by such
assignee to such Non-Extending Lender of all principal and
interest and other amounts owing to such Non-Extending Lender
under this Agreement and to execute and deliver such documents
evidencing such assignment as shall be necessary or reasonably
requested by the Borrower and reasonably satisfactory to such
Non-Extending Lender.  In the event that Continuing Lenders
having Commitments equal to or more than 66 2/3% have elected
to extend the Termination Date and, after giving effect to any
reductions under clause (i) of the preceding sentence the
Facility would be greater than or equal to $50,000,000, the
then existing Termination Date shall be extended to the day
which is 364 days after the first day of the Extension Consent
Period.

(in each case as defined in CERCLA) of Hazardous Materials by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries on, upon, into or from
any of their respective facilities or operations that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
To the best knowledge of the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries, there have been no such releases or threatened
releases on, upon, under or into any real property in the
vicinity of any of their respective facilities or operations
that, through soil, surface water or groundwater migration or
contamination, may be located on, in or under such facilities

proceeding, hearing or notice of violation, study or
investigation, based on or related to the manufacture,

the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent
that the same could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.18.  Labor Matters.

There are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower threatened, except where such
strikes, lockouts or slowdowns could not reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect. The hours worked by and payment made
to employees of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have
not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing
with such matters, where such violations could reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Transactions
will not give rise to a right of termination or right of

bargaining agreement to which the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound.

SECTION 3.19.  Reserved

does not infringe on the rights of any Person. To the best
knowledge of the Borrower, its rights and the rights of its

Lenders and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
such instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto
shall be binding on all the Lenders.  The Agent shall, in the
absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on
any instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the
proper Person or Persons.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents shall have any
responsibility to the Borrower on account of the failure of or
delay in performance or breach by any Lender of any of its
obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the
failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other
Lender or the Borrower's or any of their respective
obligations hereunder or in connection herewith or therewith.
The Agent may execute any and all duties hereunder by or
through agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon
the advice of legal counsel selected by it with respect to all
matters arising hereunder and shall not be liable for any
action taken or suffered in good faith by it in accordance
with the advice of such counsel.

The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall be
under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be
taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the
Majority Lenders.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Agent as provided below, the Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such
resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a Lender as the successor.  If no successor shall have
been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent,
which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York,
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000
or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder.  After the Agent's resignation
hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as Agent.

With respect to the Advances made by it hereunder, the
Agent, in its individual capacity and not as Agent shall have
the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent and the
Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to and generally engage in any kind of business with the
Borrower or its Affiliates as if it were not the Agent.

Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse the Agent, on demand,
in the amount of such Lender's pro rata share (based on its
Commitment hereunder) of any expenses incurred for the benefit
of the Lenders by the Agent, including fees, disbursements and
other charges of counsel and compensation of agents paid for
services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, that shall not
have been reimbursed by the Borrower and (b) to indemnify and
hold harmless the Agent and any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of such pro rata
share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against it in its capacity as the Agent, or any of them in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action
taken or omitted by it under this Agreement, to the extent the
same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower, provided
that no Lender shall be liable to the Agent for any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of
the Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or
agents.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information
as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to
make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or
based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder.

(b)  Each Lender may assign to one or more assignees all
or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments
and the Advances at the time owing to it); provided, however,
that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate of a Lender, each of the Agent and the Borrower must
give its prior written consent to such assignment (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided further,
however, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required if
a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance, (ii)
except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an

assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined

such assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not be less
than $5,000,000 (or an amount equal to the remaining balance
of such Lender's Commitment), (iii) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and

Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (e) of
this Section 9.04, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date shall
be at least five Business Days after the execution thereof and
in no event shall precede the date of such recording, (i) the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement and (ii) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to
the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance
covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall
cease to be a party hereto, but shall continue to be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.05, as well as to
any Fees accrued for its account and not yet paid).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Lender assigning its
rights and obligations under this Agreement may retain any
Auction Bid Advances made by it which are outstanding at such
time, and in such case shall retain its rights hereunder in
respect of any Auction Bid Advances so retained until such
Auction Bid Advances have been repaid in full in accordance
with this Agreement.

(c)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee
thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each
other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) such
assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial
owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of
any adverse claim and that its Commitment, and the outstanding
balances of its Advances, in each case without giving effect
to assignments thereof that have not become effective, are as
set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance; (ii) except as
set forth in clause (i) above, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made
in or in connection with this Agreement, or the execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency
or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the
Borrower or the performance or observance by the Borrower of
any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such
assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized
to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this
Agreement, together with copies of any amendments or consents
entered into prior to the date of such Assignment and
Acceptance and copies of the most recent financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 5.03 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Acceptance; (v) such assignee will independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement;
(vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the
terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it
will perform in accordance with their terms all the
obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are required
to be performed by it as a Lender.

(d)  The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to
in, or determined pursuant to, Section 9.01 a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and
a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names
and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and
principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from
time to time and whether such Lender is a Lender on the
Effective Date, or the assignee of such a Lender.  The entries
in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent
and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e)  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee,
together with an Administrative Questionnaire completed in
respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall already be
a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee
referred to in paragraph (b) above and the written consent (to
the extent required under paragraph (b) above), of the Agent
and the Borrower to such assignment, the Agent shall (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the
information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.  No assignment shall be
effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as
provided in this paragraph (e).

(f)  Each Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower
and the Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities in all or a portion of its rights and obliga-
tions under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Advances owing to it); provided, however,
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations, (iii) the participating banks or other
entities shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost
protection provisions contained in Sections 2.10, 2.13 and
9.05 to the same extent as if they were Lenders (provided that
the Borrower shall not be required to reimburse the
participating banks or other entities pursuant to Section
2.10, 2.13 or 9.05 in an amount that exceeds the amount that
would have been payable thereunder to such Lender had such
Lender not sold such participation) and (iv) the Borrower, the
Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, and such Lender
shall retain the sole right to enforce the obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
(provided that the participating bank or other entity may be
provided with the right to approve amendments, modifications
or waivers affecting it with respect to (A) any decrease in
the Fees payable hereunder with respect to Advances in which
the participating bank or other entity has purchased a
participation, (B) any change in the amount of principal of,
or decrease in the rate at which interest is payable on, the
Advances in which the participating bank or other entity has
purchased a participation, or (C) any extension of the final
scheduled maturity of any Advance in which the participating
bank or other entity has purchased a participation.  Each
participation shall be of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage of the Lender's Commitment.

(g)  Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in
paragraph (b) above, any Lender may at any time assign all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to a Federal
Reserve Bank without the prior written consent of the Borrower
or the Agent, provided that no such assignment shall release a
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such Bank for such Lender as a party hereto.  In order to
facilitate such an assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, the
Borrower shall, at the request of the assigning Lender, duly
execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a promissory note
or notes evidencing the Advances made to the Borrower, by the
assigning Lender hereunder.

(h)  The Borrower may, with the prior written consent of
the Agent, replace any of the Lenders with one or more
assignees, provided (i) that the Lender being replaced has
been paid in full for all Advances made by such Lender and all
other amounts accrued or due to such Lender hereunder, (ii)
that the full amount of the Commitments remain unchanged and
(iii) that the percentages of the total Commitments allocated
to the Lenders (other than any replaced Lenders) remain
unchanged unless prior written consent from any such affected
Lenders has been obtained.  Upon any such replacement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 9.05,
as well as to any Fees accrued for its account under
Section 2.03 and not yet paid.

(i)  In the event that:

(i)  any Lender shall have refused (and shall not
have retracted such refusal) to make available any
Advance on its part to be made available hereunder, other
than solely as a result of the failure of any condition
set forth in Article 4 to be satisfied (such condition
not having been effectively waived in accordance with the
terms hereof);

(ii) any Lender shall have notified either the Agent
or the Borrower (and shall not have retracted such
notification) that it does not intend to comply with any of
its obligations hereunder, other than solely as a result
of the failure of any condition set forth in Article
4 to be satisfied (such condition not having been
effectively waived in accordance with the terms hereof);

(iii) (A) a receiver, trustee, conservator or other
custodian shall have been appointed with respect to any
Lender or its property at the direction or request of any
Governmental Authority or (B) an order, action, process
or proceeding of the type contemplated by paragraph (g)
or (h) of Section 7.01 shall be commenced by or against
such Lender (or such Lender shall have consented to the
entry of any such order, action, process or proceeding);
or

(iv) any Lender shall have made demand upon the
Borrower for any amount pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.13;

the Borrower shall have the right, at its own expense, upon
notice to such Lender and the Agent (A) to require such
Lender, and such Lender hereby agrees, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to transfer and assign without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04(b)) all the interests, rights and obligations of
such Lender to an assignee; provided, however, that (1) no
such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule or
regulation or order of any Governmental Authority and (2) the
Borrower or such assignee, as the case may be, shall pay to
such Lender in same day funds on the date of such assignment
the principal of and interest accrued on the date of payment
on the Advances made by such Lender hereunder and all other
amounts accrued for such Lender's account or owed to it
hereunder or (B) to replace such Lender with one or more
assignees, provided, in the case of this clause (B), (1) that
the Lender being replaced has been paid in full for all
Advances made by such Lender and all other amounts accrued or
due to such Lender hereunder, (2) that the full amount of the
Commitments remains unchanged and (3) that the percentage of
the total Commitments allocated to the Lenders (other than any
replaced Lenders) remains unchanged unless prior written
consent from such Lenders has been obtained.  Upon any
assignment, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.10, 2.13 and 9.05, as well as to any fees accrued for its
account under Section 2.03 and not yet paid.

SECTION 9.05.  Expenses; Indemnity.

(a)  The Borrower agrees to pay (i) the reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges of counsel for the Agent and
BNY Capital Markets incurred in connection with the
preparation of this Agreement or in connection with any
amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof
or thereof (whether or not the transactions hereby
contemplated shall be consummated) and (ii) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender in
connection with the enforcement or protection of their rights
in connection with this Agreement or in connection with the
Advances made hereunder, including the reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges of Emmet, Marvin & Martin,
LLP, counsel for the Agent, in connection with any such
enforcement or protection and the reasonable fees, disburse-
ments and other charges of any other counsel for the Agent or
any Lender.  The Borrower further agrees that it shall
indemnify the Agent and the Lenders from, and hold them
harmless against, any documentary taxes, assessments or
similar charges made by any Governmental Authority by reason
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

(b)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent, BNY
Capital Markets and each Lender and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents (each such person
being called an "Indemnitee") against, and to hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel
fees, disbursements and other charges, incurred by or asserted
against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected
with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby
or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto
of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the
consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds
of the Advances or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not
any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the
extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses have resulted from the gross negligence or
wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

(c)  If any payment of principal of any Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate Advance or any Auction Bid Advance is made
other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such
Advance, as a result of any Conversion, payment pursuant to
Section 2.05, prepayment pursuant to clause (ii) of the
proviso to Section 2.09(a) or acceleration of the maturity of
the Advances pursuant to Section 7.01 or for any other reason,
the Borrower shall, upon demand by any Lender (with a copy of
such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of
such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for
any additional losses, costs or expenses that such Lender may
incur as a result of such payment, including any loss
(excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or
maintain such Advance.

operative and in full force and effect regardless of the
expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of
the Advances, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term
or provision of this Agreement, or any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under
this Section 9.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor.

SECTION 9.06.  Right of Setoff.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized, in addition to
any other right or remedy that any Lender may have by opera-
tion of law or otherwise, at any time and from time to time,
without notice to the Borrower (any such notice being
expressly waived by the Borrower), to exercise its banker's
lien or right of setoff and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such
Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any demand
under this Agreement and although such obligations may be un-
matured.

SECTION 9.07.  Applicable Law.

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 9.08.  Waivers; Amendments.

(a)  No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any
Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuation of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the
Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise
have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent
to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph
(b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given.  No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall
entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances.

(b)  Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may
be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement
or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the
Majority Lenders, provided, however, that no such agreement
shall (A) change the principal amount of any Advance, extend
the final scheduled maturity of any Advance, extend the
scheduled date for payment (but not prepayments) of principal
of or interest on any Advance, forgive any such payment or any
part thereof or reduce the rate of interest on any Advance, in
each case without the prior written consent of each Lender
affected thereby, (B) increase the amount or extend the
termination date of the Commitment of any Lender or reduce
or extend the date for payment of the Fees of any Lender, in
each case without the prior written consent of such Lender,
(C) amend or modify the provisions of this Section 9.08(b) or
the definition of the term "Majority Lenders" without the
prior written consent of each Lender, and provided further,
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect
the rights or duties of the Agent, without the prior written
consent of the Agent.

SECTION 9.09.  Interest Rate Limitation.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at
any time the applicable interest rate, together with all fees
and charges that are treated as interest under applicable law
(collectively, the "Charges"), as provided for herein or in
any other document executed in connection herewith, or
otherwise contracted for, charged, received, taken or reserved
by any Lender shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the
"Maximum Rate") that may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable to such Lender
hereunder, together with all Charges payable to such Lender,
shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

SECTION 9.10.  Entire Agreement.

This Agreement and the letter referred to in Section
2.03(b) constitute the entire contract between the parties
relative to the subject matter hereof.  Any previous agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof is
superseded by this Agreement.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any party other than the parties
hereto and thereto any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.11.  Waiver of Jury Trial.

Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement.
Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent
or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.11.

SECTION 9.12.  Severability.

In the event any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and en-
forceability of the remaining provisions contained herein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.  The
parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

SECTION 9.13.  Counterparts.

This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but
all of which when taken together shall constitute but one
contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section
9.03.

SECTION 9.14.  Headings.

Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents
used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not
part of this Agreement and are not to affect the construction
of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting, this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.15.  Confidentiality.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Borrower,
the Agent and each Lender hereby agree to keep all Proprietary
Information (as defined below) confidential and not to
disclose or reveal any Proprietary Information to any Person
other than the Agent's or such Lender's directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates and agents and to actual or potential
assignees and participants, and then only on a confidential
basis; provided, however, that the Agent or any Lender may
disclose Proprietary Information (a) as required by law, rule,
regulation or judicial process or in connection with any

notice of such disclosure on the same day on which it
determines such disclosure to be necessary and in any event
prior to such disclosure), (b) to its attorneys and
accountants or (c) as requested or required by any state, or
Federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or
banking.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Proprietary Information" shall include all information about
the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that has been furnished
by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, whether furnished
before or after the Effective Date, and regardless of the
manner in which it is furnishes; provided, however, that
Proprietary Information does not include information that (i)
is or becomes generally available to the public other than as
a result of a disclosure by the Agent or any Lender not
permitted by this Agreement, (ii) was available to the Agent
or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to its
disclosure by the Agent or such Lender by the Borrower or any

(a)  The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court
of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State

Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement
shall affect any right that any Lender may otherwise have to

unconditionally  waives,  to  the fullest extent it may

or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any New York State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

(c)  Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other

SECTION 2.01. REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions, and relying upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein, each Lender severally but not jointly agrees to make loans (individually
a "Revolving Credit Loan" and, collectively, the "Revolving Credit Loans") to
the Company from time to time during the Credit Commitment Period up to but not
exceeding at any one time outstanding the amount of its Credit Commitment;
provided, however, that no Revolving Credit Loan shall be made if, after giving
effect to such Revolving Credit Loan, the Aggregate Outstandings would exceed
the Total Credit Commitments in effect at such time. During the Credit
Commitment Period, the Company may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow
hereunder on or after the date hereof and prior to the Credit Commitment
Termination Date, subject to the terms, provisions and limitations set forth
herein. The Revolving Credit Loans may be (i) Adjusted Libor Loans, (ii) Prime
Rate Loans, or (iii) a combination thereof.

(b) The Company may borrow Revolving Credit Loans under the Credit
Commitment during the Credit Commitment Period on any Business Day; provided
that the Company shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable written notice
(or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) not later than 12:00 noon
New York, New York time, three Business Days prior to the date of each proposed
Adjusted Libor Loan under this Section 2.01 or prior to 12:00 noon New York, New
York time on the date of each proposed Prime Rate Loan under this Section 2.01.
Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the amount and Type of
the proposed borrowing, (ii) the proposed use of the loan proceeds, (iii) the
initial Interest Period if an Adjusted Libor Loan, and (iv) the proposed
Borrowing Date. Upon receipt of such notice from the Company, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Except for borrowings which
utilize the full remaining amount of the Total Credit Commitments, each
borrowing of a Prime Rate Loan shall be in an amount not less than $200,000 or,
if greater, whole multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each borrowing of an
Adjusted Libor Loan shall be an amount not less than $500,000 or whole multiples
of $100,000 in excess thereof. Funding of all Loans shall be made in accordance

(c) The Company shall have the right, upon not less than three Business
Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate the Total
Credit Commitments or from time to time to permanently reduce the amount of the
Total Credit Commitments; provided, however, that no such termination or
reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any
prepayments of the Revolving Credit Loans made on the effective date thereof,
the Aggregate Outstandings at such time would exceed the Total Credit
Commitments as then reduced; provided, further, that any such termination or
reduction requiring prepayment of any Adjusted Libor Loan shall be made only on
the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto or on the date of
payment in full of all amounts owing pursuant to Section 3.08 as a result of

Original Lenders and Exhibit A-2 with respect to all other Lenders, each

is authorized to record the date and amount of each Revolving Credit Loan and
the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of each Revolving
Credit Loan in such Lender's records or on the grid schedule annexed to the
Note; provided, however, that the failure of a Lender to set forth each such
Revolving Credit Loan, payment and other information shall not in any manner
affect the obligation of the Company to repay each Revolving Credit Loan made by
such Lender in accordance with the terms of its Revolving Credit Note and this
Agreement. The Revolving Credit Note, the grid schedule and the books and
records of each Lender shall constitute presumptive evidence of the information
so recorded absent clear and obvious error.

conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company may utilize up to the entire
Total Credit Commitments for loans from the Lenders and the Lenders agree to

amount not less than $500,000 or, if greater, whole multiples of $100,000 in
excess thereof. Each borrowing of a Treasury Rate Loan shall be an amount not
less than $500,000 or whole multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. Funding of
all Loans shall be made in accordance with Section 3.10.

completed, duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company and payable to
the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to the Credit Commitment of
such Lender. Each Acquisition Term Note shall (a) be stated to mature on the

that the outstanding principal amount of all Acquisition Term Loans shall be due
and payable on the Final Maturity Date, together with interest thereon as of
such date. Each Acquisition Term Loan shall bear interest from the date of
funding thereof until paid in full on the unpaid principal amount thereof from
time to time outstanding at the applicable interest rate per annum specified in
Section 3.01. The date and amount of each Acquisition Term Loan and the date and
amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of such Acquisition Term Loan
shall be recorded on a schedule annexed to such Acquisition Term Note, and the
Company authorizes each Lender to make such recordation; provided, however, that
the failure of a Lender to set forth payments and other information in such grid
shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay each
Acquisition Term Loan made by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Each Acquisition Term Note, the grid schedule and the books and
records of each Lender shall constitute presumptive evidence of the information
so recorded absent clear and obvious error.

of their maturity up to the full amount thereof, and, then, to outstanding
Treasury Rate Loans.

SECTION 3.04. FEES. (a) On the Closing Date, the Company agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, a facility fee of
$187,500 which shall be payable on the Closing Date, such fee to be distributed
to the Lenders based upon their respective Commitment Proportion.

(b) The Company shall pay to each Lender, pro rata based on
each Lender's Commitment Proportion, a commitment fee on the average daily
amount of the Total Credit Commitments less the aggregate principal amount of
the Loans outstanding from the date of this Agreement until the Credit
Commitment Termination Date at the rate of 1/2 of 1% per annum, based on a year
of 360 days, payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar
quarter, commencing December 31, 2000, and on the Credit Commitment Termination
Date and on any day the Total Credit Commitments are permanently reduced in
whole or in part.

(c) The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent, as sole
administrative and collateral agent, such fees as shall be specified in an
agreement between the Company and the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 3.05. INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. In the event that
the Administrative Agent have determined (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Company) that, by reason of circumstances
affecting the London interbank market, adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Reserve Adjusted Libor applicable pursuant to Section
3.01(b) for any requested Interest Period with respect to (a) the making of an
Adjusted Libor Loan, (b) an Adjusted Libor Loan that will result from the
requested conversion of a Prime Rate Loan into an Adjusted Libor Loan, or (c)
the continuation of an Adjusted Libor Loan beyond the expiration of the then
current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Administrative Agent shall
forthwith give notice by telephone of such determination, promptly confirmed in
writing, to the




18
<PAGE>   24


Company of such determination. Until the Administrative Agent notifies the
Company that the circumstances giving rise to the suspension described herein no
longer exist, the Company shall not have the right to request or continue an
Adjusted Libor Loan or to convert a Prime Rate Loan to an Adjusted Libor Loan.

SECTION 3.06. ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein,
if any introduction of or change in any law, regulation, treaty or directive or
in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any
Lender to make or maintain any Fixed Rate Loans as contemplated by this
Agreement, such Lender shall forthwith give notice by telephone of such
circumstances, promptly confirmed in writing, and (a) the commitments of the
Lenders to make and to allow conversion to or continuations of any Fixed Rate
Loans shall forthwith be cancelled for the duration of such illegality and (b)
the Loans then outstanding as Fixed Rate Loans, if any, shall be converted
automatically to Prime Rate Loans on (x) with respect to any Adjusted Libor
Loan, the next succeeding last day of each Interest Period applicable to such
Adjusted Libor Loans, (y) with respect to any Treasury Rate Loan, on the date
designated in a writing by the Administrative Agent to the Company and the
Lenders not less than 3 Business Days prior to the date of conversion or (z) on
such earlier date as may be required by law. The Company shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, upon demand, any
additional amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.08.

SECTION 3.07. INCREASED COSTS. (a) In the event that any introduction
of or change in, on or after the date hereof, any applicable law, regulation,
treaty, order, or directive or change in the interpretation or application
thereof (including, without limitation, any request, guideline or policy,
whether or not having the force of law, of or from any central bank or other
governmental authority, agency or instrumentality and including, without
limitation, Regulation D), by any authority charged with the administration or
interpretation thereof shall occur, which:

(i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with
respect to this Agreement, any Note, or any Loan, or change the basis
of taxation of payments to such Lender of principal, interest, fees or
any other amount payable hereunder (other than any tax that is measured
with respect to the overall net income of such Lender or Lending Office
of such Lender and that is imposed by the United States of America, or
any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or by
any jurisdiction in which such Lender's Lending Office is located, or
by any jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized, has its
principal office or is managed and controlled); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement (whether or not having
the force of law) against assets held by, or deposits or other
liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other
credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of
any Lender; or

(iii)  shall impose on any Lender any other condition;



19
<PAGE>   25

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making, renewing or maintaining or participating in advances or extensions of
credit hereunder or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder, in each case by
an amount which such Lender deems material, then, in any such case, the Company
shall pay such Lender, upon demand, such additional amount or amounts as such
Lender shall have determined will compensate such Lender for such increased
costs or reduction.

(b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of
any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change
therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any
lending office of any Lender) or any Lender's holding company, with any request
or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of the
law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the
capital of such Lender's holding company as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding
company could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking
into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's
holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such
Lender to be material, then from time to time, the Company shall pay to such
Lender the additional amount or amounts as such Lender shall have determined
will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for such reduction.
Such Lender's determination of such amounts shall be conclusive and binding on
the Company absent clear and obvious error.

(c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or
amounts payable pursuant to Sections 3.07(a) and 3.07(b) shall be conclusive
absent clear and obvious error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

(d) In the event any Lender shall be entitled to compensation
pursuant to Section 3.07(a) or Section 3.07(b), it shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent and the Company of the event by reason of which it has
become so entitled; provided, however, no failure on the part of any Lender to
demand compensation under clause (a) or clause (b) above on one occasion shall
constitute a waiver of its right to demand compensation on any other occasion.

SECTION 3.08. INDEMNITY. The Company agrees to indemnify each Lender
and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense which any Lender
may sustain or incur, including, without limitation, interest or fees payable by
such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain Fixed Rate
Loans hereunder, as a consequence of (a) default by the Company in payment of
the principal amount of or interest on any Fixed Rate Loan, (b) default by the
Company to accept or make a borrowing of a Fixed Rate Loan or a conversion into
or continuation of an Adjusted Libor Loan after the Company has requested such
borrowing, conversion or continuation in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, (c) default by the Company in





20
<PAGE>   26


making any prepayment of any Fixed Rate Loan after the Company gives a notice in
accordance with Section 3.03 and/or (d) the making of any payment or prepayment
(whether mandatory or optional) of a Fixed Rate Loan or the making of any
conversion of an Adjusted Libor Loan to a Prime Rate Loan on a day which is not
the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect thereto. A
certificate of the applicable Lender setting forth such amounts shall be
conclusive absent clear and obvious error. The Company shall pay the
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, the amount shown
as due on any certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.

SECTION 3.09. TAXES. (a) Except as set forth in clause (c) below or as
required by law, all payments made by the Company under this Agreement shall be
made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any present
or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority, excluding income and franchise taxes imposed on
the Administrative Agent or a Lender by (i) the United States of America or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, (ii) the
jurisdiction under the laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender is
organized or in which it has its principal office or is managed and controlled
or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or (iii)
any jurisdiction in which such Lender's Lending Office is located or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (such non- excluded
taxes being called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any
amounts payable to the Administrative Agent, or any Lender hereunder, or under
the Notes, the amount so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender
shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent
or such Lender (after payment of all Taxes and free and clear of all liability
in respect of such Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder
at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the Notes.
Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Company, as promptly as possible
thereafter, the Company shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own
account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy
of an original official receipt showing payment thereof. If the Company fails to
pay Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the
Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary
evidence, the Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender as a result of any such failure together
with any expenses payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
connection therewith.

(b) Prior to the first Interest Payment Date, each Lender that
is not organized under the laws of the United States or a state thereof agrees
that it will deliver to the Administrative Agent (i) two duly completed copies
of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN or successor
applicable form, as the case may be, certifying in each case that such Lender is
entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, and (ii) an Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor applicable form, as the case may
be, to establish an exemption from United States back-up withholding tax. Each
Lender which delivers to the Company and the Administrative Agent a Form W-8ECI




21
<PAGE>   27


or W-8BEN and Form W-8 or W-9 pursuant to the preceding sentence further
undertakes to deliver to the Administrative Agent two further copies of the said
statement and Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable
forms, or other manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before the
date that any such letter or form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent letter and form
previously delivered by it to the Administrative Agent, and such extensions or
renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent,
certifying in the case of a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN that such Lender is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes.

SECTION 3.10. PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS. Each borrowing by the
Company from the Lenders, each conversion of a Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to
Section 3.01(h) or continuation of a Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to Section
3.01(i), each payment by the Company on account of any fee (other than with
respect to fees which are expressly payable to the Administrative Agent for its
own account), and any reduction of the Credit Commitments of the Lenders
hereunder shall be made pro rata according to the respective relevant Commitment
Proportions of the Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the
Company on account of principal of and interest on each Revolving Credit Loan
and Acquisition Term Loan shall be made pro rata according to the respective
outstanding principal amounts of such Loans held by each Lender. All payments
(including prepayments) to be made by the Company on account of principal,
interest, fees and reimbursement obligations shall be made without set-off or
counterclaim and shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Lenders, at the Payment Office of the Administrative Agent in Dollars in
immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such
payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds by wire transfer of
each Lender's portion of such payment to such Lender for the account of its
Lending Office. The Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, directly
charge principal and interest payments due in respect of the Loans to the
Company's accounts at the Payment Office or other office of the Administrative
Agent. Except as otherwise provided in the definition of "Interest Period", if
any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business
Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and,
with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the
then applicable rate during such extension.

SECTION 3.11. MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.07, or if the Company is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.09, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.07 or 3.09, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense or legal, regulatory or administrative burdens and would not otherwise
be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.



22
<PAGE>   28

(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.07, or
if the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.09,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 10.05), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may
be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the
Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall
have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its
Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to
it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
under Section 3.07 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.09,
such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A
Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

ARTICLE V
CONDITIONS OF LENDING

SECTION 5.01. CONDITIONS TO LOANS. The several obligations of each
Lender to make the Loans hereunder are subject to the following conditions
precedent:

THE AGENTS

SECTION 9.01. APPOINTMENT, POWERS AND IMMUNITIES. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes each Agent to act as its agent hereunder,
under the Security Documents and under the other Loan Documents with such powers
as are specifically delegated to such Agent by the terms of this Agreement, the
Security Documents and the other Loan Documents together with such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. No Agent shall have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Security Documents and the other Loan Documents and shall not be a trustee for
any Lender, nor is any Agent acting in a fiduciary capacity of any kind under
this Agreement, the Security Documents or the other Loan Documents or in respect
thereof or in respect of any Lender. The Agents shall not be responsible to the
Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement, the Security Documents, or the other Loan Documents, in any
certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any
of them under, this Agreement, the Security Documents or the other Loan
Documents, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, the Security Documents or the
other Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for herein or
therein or for the collectibility of the Loans or for the validity,
effectiveness or value of any interest or security covered by the Security
Documents or for the value of any collateral or for the validity or
effectiveness of any assignment, mortgage, pledge, security agreement, financing
statement, document or instrument, or for the filing, recording, re-filing,
continuing or re-recording of any thereof or for any failure by the Company or
any Corporate Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents. Each Agent may take all actions by itself and/or it may
employ agents and attorneys-in-fact, and shall not be responsible, except as to
money or the securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the
negligence or misconduct of itself or its employees or of any such agents or
attorneys-in-fact, if such agents or attorneys-in-fact are selected by it with
reasonable care. Neither any Agent nor any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder, under the Security
Documents or under the other Loan Documents or in connection herewith or
therewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 9.02. RELIANCE BY AGENTS. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any certification,
notice or other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telex,
telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts
selected by such Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this
Agreement, the Security Documents or the other Loan Documents, each Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
hereunder, under the Security Documents or under the other Loan Documents in
accordance with instructions signed by the Required Lenders, or such other
number of Lenders as is specified in Section 10.04, and such instructions of the
Required Lenders or other number of Lenders as



48
<PAGE>   54


aforesaid and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding on all of the Lenders.

SECTION 9.03. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default
(other than the non-payment of principal of or interest on the Loans to the
extent the same is required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders) unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from
a Lender or the Company specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating
that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that the Administrative
Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default,
the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall (subject to Section 9.07) take such action with
respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be directed by the Required
Lenders, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.04; provided that unless and
until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the
Administrative Agent may (but is not obligated to) take such action, or refrain
from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it
shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders.

SECTION 9.04. RIGHTS AS A LENDER. With respect to its Credit Commitment
and the Loans made by it, each entity which is an Agent in its capacity as a
Lender hereunder shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not acting as an Agent, and
the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates,
include each entity which is an Agent in its individual capacity. Each entity
which is an Agent and each of its Affiliates may (without having to account
therefor to any Lender) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Company or its
Affiliates, as if it were not acting as an Agent, and, except to the extent
otherwise herein specifically set forth, each entity which is an Agent may
accept fees and other consideration from the Company or its Affiliates, for
services in connection with this Agreement, the Security Documents or any of the
other Loan Documents or otherwise without having to account for the same to the
Lenders.

SECTION 9.05. INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders shall indemnify each Agent
(to the extent not reimbursed by the Company under Section 10.03), ratably in
accordance with the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans made by
the Lenders (or, if no Loans are at the time outstanding, ratably in accordance
with their respective Credit Commitments), for any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in its capacity as an Agent in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Security Documents or
any of the other Loan Documents or any other documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which the Company
is obligated to pay under Section 10.03 or under the applicable provisions of
any other Loan Document) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or of the
Security Documents, or of any other Loan Document, provided that no



49
<PAGE>   55


Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent.

SECTION 9.06. NON-RELIANCE ON AGENTS AND OTHER LENDERS. Each Lender
agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on any Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Company and decision to enter
into this Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, the Security
Documents or the other Loan Documents. No Agent shall be required to keep itself
informed as to the performance or observance by the Company of this Agreement,
the Security Documents or the other Loan Documents or any other document
referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or
books of the Company. Except for notices, reports and other documents and
information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by an Agent
hereunder or under the Security Documents or the other Loan Documents, an Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit
or other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of
the Company, which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its
Affiliates.

SECTION 9.07. FAILURE TO ACT. Except for action expressly required of
an Agent hereunder or under the Security Documents, such Agent shall in all
cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or thereunder
unless it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any
and all liability and expense (except to the extent resulting from gross
negligence and willful misconduct) which may be incurred by it by reason of
taking or continuing to take any such action.

SECTION 9.08. RESIGNATION OF AN AGENT. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this Section 9.08, an Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Company. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Company, to appoint a successor to such Agent. If no successor shall have been
so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the resigning Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the resigning Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent
which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of
any such bank with an office in New York, New York. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
resigning Agent, and the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Company and such successor. After an Agent's resignation hereunder,
the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such resigning Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was acting as an Agent.

SECTION 9.09. SHARING OF COLLATERAL AND PAYMENTS. In the event that at
any time any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of a Note or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof, whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, set-off or
counterclaim against the Company or otherwise (except pursuant to Section
10.05), in a greater proportion than the proportion received by any other Lender
in respect of the corresponding Note held by it or interest thereon, then the
Lender so receiving such greater proportionate payment shall purchase for cash
from the other Lender or Lenders such portion of each such other Lender's or
Lenders' Loans, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any
such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause the
Lender receiving the proportionate over-payment to share the excess payment or
benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders each of
which shall have a lien on its ratable portion of the amount described hereafter
obtained from the Company; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from the Lender which
received the proportionate over-payment, such purchase shall be rescinded, and
the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest. The Company agrees, to the extent it may do so under
applicable law, that each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's
Loans may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights
of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the
direct holder of such portion.

SECTION 10.04. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. With the written consent of the
Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Company may, from time to
time, enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the Notes or any of the
other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of
the Company hereunder or thereunder, and with the written consent of the
Required Lenders the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may execute
and deliver to the Company a written instrument waiving, on such terms and
conditions as the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may specify in
such instrument, any of the requirements of this Agreement or the Notes or any

53
<PAGE>   59



on any Note or any fees payable to the Lenders hereunder, (c) reduce the

amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 10.04, (f) reduce the

any Corporate Guarantor from its Corporate Guaranty, or limit any Corporate
Guarantor's liability with respect to its Corporate Guaranty, in each case
specified in clauses (a) through (i) above without the written consent of all
the Lenders; and provided, further, that no such waiver and no such amendment,
supplement or modification shall (i) amend, modify, supplement or waive any
provision of Article IX with respect to any Agent without the written consent of
such Agent or (ii) increase the amount of any Lender's Credit Commitment without
the written consent of such Lender. Any such waiver and any such amendment,
supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall
be binding upon the Company, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all
future holders of the Notes.

SECTION 10.05. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS. (a) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the
Lenders, the Agents, all future holders of the Notes and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Company may not assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of each Lender, and any such attempted assignment or transfer without
such consent shall be null and void.

(b) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more
banks or other financial institutions ("Participants") participating interests
in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Credit
Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender hereunder. In the
event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant,
such Lender's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible
for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such
Note for all purposes under this Agreement, and the Company and the
Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
The Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.07, 3.08 and 3.09 with respect to its participation in the Credit
Commitments and in the Loans outstanding from time to time; provided, however,
that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to
such sections than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in
respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender
to such Participant had no such transfer occurred. No Participant shall have the
right to consent to any amendment to, or waiver of, any provision of this
Agreement, except the transferor Lender may provide in its agreement with the
Participant that




54
<PAGE>   60


such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment or waiver described in clause (a) through clause (i) of Section 10.04.

(c) Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph (c) any Lender may,
in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with
applicable law, at any time sell to any Lender or any domestic banking affiliate
thereof, and to one or more additional banks or financial institutions provided
that such Purchasing Lender is a bank organized under the laws of the United
States of America or any state thereof and has combined capital and surplus of
at least $200,000,000 ("Purchasing Lenders") all or any part of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to an
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, executed by such Purchasing Lender, such
transferor Lender and the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement relating to a Purchasing Lender that is not
then a Lender or a domestic banking affiliate thereof, also executed by the
Company), and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance. Upon
such execution, delivery and acceptance from and after the effective date
specified in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (i) the Purchasing Lender
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder with a Credit Commitment as set forth therein and (ii) the transferor
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement covering all or the
remaining portion of a transferor Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such transferor Lender shall cease to be a party hereto except as to
Sections 3.07, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10 and 10.03 for the period prior to the effective
date). Such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement shall be deemed to amend this
Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the
addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of Commitment
Proportions arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a
portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under or in
respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. On or prior to the
effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, the
Company, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent, in exchange for the Notes surrendered pursuant to the Assignment and
Acceptance Agreement, new Notes to the order of such Purchasing Lender in an
amount equal to the Credit Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance Agreement and, if the transferor Lender has retained any Credit
Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the transferor Lender in an
amount equal to such Credit Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes
shall be in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such surrendered
Notes, shall be dated the date of the Notes they replace and shall otherwise be
in the form of the Notes replaced thereby. The Notes surrendered by the
transferor Lender shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Company
marked "cancelled". Anything in this Section 10.05 to the contrary
notwithstanding, no transfer to a Purchasing Lender shall be made pursuant to
this paragraph (c) if such transfer by any one transferor Lender to any one
Purchasing Lender (other than a Purchasing Lender which is a Lender hereunder
prior to such transfer) (x) is in respect of less than $1,000,000 of the Credit
Commitment of such transferor Lender or (y) if less than all of the Credit
Commitment of such transferor Lender is transferred, after



55
<PAGE>   61


giving effect to such transfer the amount held by any transferor Lender would be
less than $1,000,000.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to
in Section 10.01 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to
it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders and the Credit Commitments of, and principal amount of
the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive, in the absence of clear and obvious error and the Company,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loans recorded therein for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Company or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

(e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement executed
by a transferor Lender and a Purchasing Lender (and, in the case of a Purchasing
Lender that is not then a Lender or an Affiliate thereof, by the Company)
together with payment by the Purchasing Lender to the Administrative Agent of a
registration and processing fee of $3,500 if the Purchasing Lender is not a
Lender prior to the execution of an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and
$2,500 if the Purchasing Lender is a Lender prior to the execution of an
Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall (i) accept
such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register, and (iii) give prompt notice of such acceptance and
recordation to the Lenders and the Company.

(f) The Company authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant
or Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any
and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning the Company
and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of
the Company pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such
Lender by the Company in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the
Company and the Corporate Guarantors prior to entering into this Agreement.

(g) If, pursuant to this Section 10.05, any interest in this Agreement,
a participation agreement, or any Note is transferred to any Transferee which is
organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any
State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently
with the effectiveness of such transfer, (i) to represent to the transferor
Lender (for the benefit of the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and
the Company) that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to
be withheld by the Administrative Agent, the Company, or the transferor Lender
with respect to any payments to be made to such Transferee in respect of the
Loans, (ii) to furnish to the Administrative Agent, the transferor Lender and
the Company either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (wherein such Transferee claims entitlement to
complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all interest payments
hereunder) and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the
transferor Lender and the Company) to provide the Administrative Agent, the
transferor Lender and the Company a new Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI upon the
expiration




56
<PAGE>   62


or obsolescence of any previously delivered form and comparable statements in
accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments duly
executed and completed by such Transferee, and to comply from time to time with
all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard to such withholding tax
exemption.

(h) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign or grant a security
interest in all or any part of its rights under this Agreement and its Notes to
a Federal Reserve Bank, provided that no such assignment shall release the
transferor Lender from its Credit Commitment or its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party to this
Agreement.

SECTION 10.06. NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. Neither any failure nor
any delay on the part of any Lender or the Administrative Agent in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note or any other Loan
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided
or provided in the other Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies powers and privileges provided by law.

SECTION 10.07. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OR CHOICE OF LAW.

SECTION 10.08. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; JURY WAIVER; WAIVER OF
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE
JURISDICTION OF ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF
NEW YORK, COUNTY OF NASSAU OR COUNTY OF SUFFOLK IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT AGAINST IT AND RELATED TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY
HEREBY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT BY WAY OF MOTION, AS A DEFENSE OR
OTHERWISE, IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ANY CLAIM THAT IT IS NOT
PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS, THAT ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, THAT THE
VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IS IMPROPER, OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT OR INSTRUMENT REFERRED TO
HEREIN OR THEREIN OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF THEREOF MAY NOT BE LITIGATED IN
OR BY SUCH FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
THE COMPANY AGREES NOT TO (I) SEEK AND HEREBY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO ANY REVIEW OF
THE JUDGMENT OF ANY SUCH FEDERAL OR STATE COURT BY ANY FEDERAL OR






57
<PAGE>   63


STATE COURT OF ANY OTHER NATION OR JURISDICTION WHICH MAY BE CALLED UPON TO
GRANT AN ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH JUDGMENT OR (II) ASSERT ANY COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE COMPANY AGREES THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY
BE MADE UPON IT BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL TO THE ADDRESS FOR NOTICES SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY METHOD AUTHORIZED BY THE LAWS OF NEW YORK. EACH
PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY
LAW, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY
LITIGATION REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION 10.08 ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES OTHER THAN, OR IN ADDITION TO, ACTUAL
DAMAGES. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH AGENT OR SUCH LENDER WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
HEREIN.

SECTION 10.09. SEVERABILITY. In case any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Document should be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 10.10 RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each
Affiliate of each Lender are each hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or the account of the
Company against any and all of the Obligations of the Company now and hereafter
existing under this Agreement and the Notes held by such Lender, irrespective of
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or
any Note and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of the
Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Affiliate of each Lender under this
Section 10.10 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of setoff) which they may have.

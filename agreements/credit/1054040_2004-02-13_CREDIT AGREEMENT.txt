aggregate Revolving Exposure would exceed the Revolving Commitments, the
Borrower shall prepay Revolving Loans and/or Swingline Loans in an amount
sufficient to eliminate such excess.

SECTION 4. Representations and Warranties. Each of the Borrower
and Holdings represents and warrants to each other party hereto that, after

though made on and as of the date hereof, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, and (b)
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

become effective as of the date (the "Amendment Effective Date") that (a)
the Proposed Sale and the Mandatory Prepayment shall have occurred and (b)
the Administrative Agent shall have received (i) counterparts of this
Amendment which, when taken together, bear the signatures of the Borrower,
Holdings and the Required Lenders and (ii) reimbursement of all fees and
expenses of the Administrative Agent for which invoices have been submitted
to the Borrower.

SECTION 6. Release of Collateral. Upon the effectiveness of this
Amendment as provided above, the Required Lenders hereby authorize and
direct the Collateral Agent to take any and all action as may be reasonably
requested by the Borrower to evidence the release of the security interests
of the Security Documents in the Non-Dairy Creamer Assets.

SECTION 7. Effect of Amendment. Except as expressly set forth
herein, this Amendment shall not by implication or otherwise limit, impair,
constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect the rights and remedies of the
Lenders, the Swingline Lender, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or
the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and shall not alter, modify, amend or in any way affect any of
the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in
the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, all of which are ratified
and affirmed in all respects and shall continue in full force and effect.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to entitle the Borrower or Holdings to a
consent to, or a waiver, amendment, modification or other change of, any of
the terms, conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in
the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document in similar or different
circumstances. This Amendment shall apply and be effective only with
respect to the provisions of the Credit Agreement specifically referred to
herein.

SECTION 8. Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed
an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one
and the same instrument. Delivery of any executed counterpart of a
signature page of this Amendment by facsimile transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

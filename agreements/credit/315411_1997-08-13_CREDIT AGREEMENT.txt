Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar Advances. Each Eurodollar Advance

Advance shall bear interest from and including the first day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto to, but not including, the last day of such Interest
Period at the Eurodollar Rate determined as applicable to such Eurodollar

requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates),
declare that each Eurodollar Advance and Floating Rate Advance shall bear
interest (for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period in the case of

plus two percent (2.0%) per annum; provided, however, that such increased rate

remain applicable until revoked by the Required Lenders in the event of a
Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7.

payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.

2.13. Notes; Notices. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record the
principal amount of each of its Loans and each repayment on the schedule
attached to its Note; provided, however, that neither the failure to so record
nor any error in such recordation shall affect the Borrower's


<PAGE>


obligations under such Note. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the
Agent only to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types
of Advances and to transfer funds based on (a) written notice signed by any
Authorized Officer or (b) telephonic notices made by any Authorized Officer. The
Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, if such
confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice,
signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any
material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records
of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.

2.14. Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued on
each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which a
Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and
at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal
amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance on a day
other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest
accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of its
applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is
prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued
on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months
shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such
Interest Period. Interest and commitment fees shall be calculated for actual
days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the
day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if
payment is received prior to noon (Chicago time) at the place of payment. If any
payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time
shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment.

2.15. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment
Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender of
the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice,
Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.
The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each
Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will
give each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Floating Rate.

2.16. Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending
Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation
from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending
Installation and the Notes shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit
of such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written or facsimile notice to
the Agent and the Borrower, designate a Lending Installation through which Loans
will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.

2.17. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Borrower or a Lender,
as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan, or (b) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made. The Agent may, but


<PAGE>


shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the
intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If the Borrower has not in
fact made such payment to the Agent, the Lenders shall, on demand by the Agent,
repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon
in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was
so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at
a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day. If any
Lender has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, such Lender or the
Borrower shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made
available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the
period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent
until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (a)
in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such
day, or (b) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable
to the relevant Loan.

2.18. Taxes. (a) Any payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement
shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on
account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed,
levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding
net income taxes and franchise taxes or any other tax based upon any income
imposed on the Agent or any Lender by the jurisdiction in which the Agent or
such Lender is incorporated or has its principal place of business or in which
the applicable Lending Installation is located. If any such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings
("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to
the Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Agent or such
Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Agent or such
Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other
amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in or
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be
required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not
organized under the laws of the U.S. or a state thereof if such Lender fails to
comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this Section 2.18. Whenever any
Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as practicable
thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Agent for its own account or for the
account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original
official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the
Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Agent the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for
any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any
Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this
Section 2.18 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of
all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b)  At least five Business Days prior to the first date on which
interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Lender, each
Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America,
or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrower and the
Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form
1001 or 4224 (and any other documentary evidence issued by any non-U.S.
governmental authorities as required by U.S. Treasury regulations), certifying
in any case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States


<PAGE>


federal income taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further
undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional
copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that such form
expires (currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one
calendar year for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any
event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such
amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender
is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an
event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation)
has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of
receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax.

2.19. Agent's Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent those fees, in
addition to the commitment fees referenced in Section 2.4(a), separately agreed
to between the Agent and the Borrower.

2.20. Mandatory Prepayment in the Event of a Change in Control. Upon the
earlier of (a) ten (10) Business Days prior to the consummation of any
transaction which would cause a Change in Control, and (b) the execution of a
definitive agreement in respect of any such transaction, the Borrower shall
notify the Agent and each Lender of such expected transaction, including the
expected closing date of such transaction. Upon the execution of any such
agreement and while such agreement shall continue in effect, each Lender's
Commitment shall be suspended. Unless an earlier date is otherwise agreed upon
among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders, each Lender's Commitment shall
terminate simultaneously with the closing of such transaction and the Borrower
shall repay at such time all of the Lenders' outstanding Loans, together with
accrued interest thereon, any accrued fees with respect to the Commitments, any
costs, losses or expenses incurred by the Lenders in connection with such
prepayment pursuant to Section 3.4 and any other Obligations of the Borrowers to
the Agent and the Lenders hereunder.


ARTICLE III

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES


3.1. Yield Protection. If, after the date hereof, the adoption of, or any
change in, any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation,
policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any
interpretation thereof, or the compliance of the Agent or any Lender therewith,

(a)  subjects the Agent, any Lender or any applicable Lending
Installation to any tax, duty, charge or withholding on or from payments due
from the Borrower (excluding taxation of the overall net income of the Agent,
any Lender or applicable Lending Installation imposed by the


<PAGE>


jurisdiction in which the Agent, such Lender or such Lending Installation is
incorporated or has its principal place of business), or changes the basis of
taxation of principal, interest or any other payments to the Agent, any Lender
or any Lending Installation in respect of its Loans or other amounts due it
hereunder (excluding taxation of the overall net income of the Agent, any Lender
or applicable Lending Installation imposed by the jurisdiction in which the
Agent, such Lender or such Lending Installation is incorporated or has its
principal place of business), or

(b)  imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment,
insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by the Agent, any Lender
or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments
taken into account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar
Advances), or

(c)  imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding
or maintaining Loans or reduces any amount receivable by the Agent, any Lender
or any applicable Lending Installation in connection with any Loans, or requires
any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated
by reference to the amount of Loans held, or interest received by it, by an
amount deemed material by such Lender,

then, within 15 days of demand by the Agent or such Lender, the Borrower shall
pay the Agent or such Lender that portion of such increased expense incurred or
resulting in an amount received which such Lender reasonably determines is
attributable to making, funding and maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.

3.2. Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any
Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender
is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand by such
Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate
for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital
which such Lender reasonably determines is attributable to this Agreement, its
Loans or its obligation to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such
Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (a) any change after
the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines, or (b) any
adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any
Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based
Capital Guidelines" means (a) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the
United States on the date of this Agreement and (b) the corresponding capital
regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States
implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation
and Supervisory Practices entitled "International Convergence of Capital
Measurements and Capital Standards" and any amendments to such regulations
adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.


<PAGE>

3.3. Availability of Eurodollar Advances. If any Lender determines that
maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would
violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (a) deposits
of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not
available, or (b) the interest rate applicable to a Eurodollar Advance does not
accurately or fairly reflect the cost of making or maintaining such Advance,
then the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances until such
circumstance no longer exists and require any Eurodollar Advances to be repaid.

3.4. Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs
on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether
because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Advance is not
made on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason other than default by
the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify the Agent and each Lender for any loss
or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any
loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain
the Eurodollar Advance.

3.5. Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurodollar Advances to reduce any liability of the Borrower to
such Lender under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 or to avoid the unavailability of a Type
of Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous
to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to
the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable
detail the calculations upon which such Lender reasonably determined such amount
and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of
manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in
connection with a Eurodollar Advance shall be calculated as though each Lender
funded its Eurodollar Advances through the purchase of a deposit of the type and
maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the
Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or
not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written
statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower
of the written statement. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 2.18,
3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
this Agreement; provided, that the Borrower will have no obligation to pay any
amount pursuant to Section 2.18, 3.1 or 3.2 if a demand is not made within 180
days of the date on which the Lender's right to reimbursement arises.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that, both before and
after giving effect to the Closing Transactions:

5.1. Corporate Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and each
Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation and is
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing and is duly authorized to
conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted or
proposed to be conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or authorized could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

5.2. Authorization and Validity. The Borrower and each Subsidiary have all
requisite corporate power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver
(or file, as the case may be) each of the Loan Documents and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations
thereunder. The execution and delivery (or filing, as the case may be) by the
Borrower and each Subsidiary of the Loan Documents and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and the performance of their respective
obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings
and the Loan Documents and the other Transaction Documents constitute legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable,
enforceable against the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in
accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and by equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in equity or at law).

5.3. Compliance with Laws and Contracts. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects with all applicable statutes, rules,
regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or
any instrumentality or agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of
their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective properties,
except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower and
each Subsidiary of the Loan Documents and the other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party, the application of the proceeds of the Loans, the
consummation of the Closing Transactions or any other transaction contemplated
in the Loan Documents or the other Transaction Documents, nor compliance with
the provisions of the Loan Documents or the other Transaction Documents will, or
at the relevant time did, (a) violate any law, rule, regulation (including
Regulations G, T, U and X), order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award
binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's
charter, articles or certificate of incorporation or by-laws, (b) violate the


<PAGE>


provisions of or require the approval or consent of any party to any indenture,

Lien (other than Liens permitted by, the Loan Documents) in, of or on the
property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such
indenture, instrument or agreement, or (c) require any consent of the
stockholders of any Person, except for approvals or consents which will be
obtained on or before the initial Advance and are disclosed on Schedule 5.3,
except, with respect to each of clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 5.3,
for any violation of, conflict with, default under or failure to obtain an
approval or consent required under, any such law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, award, indenture, instrument or agreement that
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.4. Governmental Consents. No order, consent, approval, qualification,

with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of, any court, governmental or
public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, any securities exchange or
other Person is or at the relevant time was required to authorize, or is or at
the relevant time was required in connection with the execution, delivery,

application of the proceeds of the Loans or the consummation of the Acquisition
or any other transaction contemplated in the Loan Documents or the Transaction
Documents, except for (a) the approvals and Licenses set forth on Schedule 5.4,
which have been obtained and are in full force and effect and (b) the approvals
required to be obtained from the insurance departments of the States of Indiana,
Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin, the failure to obtain which could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No filings were required to be
made with respect to the Acquisition under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

5.5. Financial Statements. (a) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the
Agent (i) the December 31, 1996 audited consolidated financial statements of the

(v) the December 31, 1996 audited Annual Statement of Old ACI, and (vi) the
March 31, 1997 Quarterly Statement of Old ACI (collectively, the "Financial

generally accepted accounting principles or SAP, as applicable, and (in the case
of the Financial Statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles) fairly presents the financial condition of the Persons
described therein at such dates and the results of their operations for the
respective periods then ended (except, in the case of such unaudited statements,
for normal year-end audit adjustments).

(b)  The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet at March 31,
1997 and unaudited pro forma consolidated profit and loss statement for the year
ended December 31, 1996 and the three months ended March 31, 1997 (the "Pro
Forma") of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is attached hereto as Schedule 5.5.

liabilities, financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated
basis in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles, consistently applied,
and taking into account the Closing Transactions and the other transactions and
actions contemplated by this Agreement, the Loan Documents and the Transaction
Documents.

5.6. Material Adverse Change. No material adverse change in the business,
Property, financial condition, prospects or operations of either the Borrower or
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole has occurred since December

pursuant to any assessment received by any such Person, except such taxes, if
any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have
been provided in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles and as to which
no Lien exists. No tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted
with respect to any taxes owed by Borrower or any Subsidiary which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals
and reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any
taxes or other governmental charges are in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles or SAP, as applicable.

5.8. Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.8, there is no
litigation, arbitration, proceeding, inquiry or governmental investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or
affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent, enjoin or unduly delay the making of the Loans under this Agreement or
the consummation of any other Closing Transaction.

5.9. Capitalization. Schedule 5.9 hereto contains (a) an accurate
description of the Borrower's capitalization as of the date of this Agreement
after giving effect to the Closing Transactions and (b) an accurate list of all
of the existing Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement after giving
effect to the Acquisition and the other Closing Transactions and setting forth
their respective jurisdictions of incorporation and the percentage of their
capital stock owned by the Borrower or other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Borrower and of each Subsidiary have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable,
and all such shares of each Subsidiary are free and clear of all Liens. Except
as set forth on Schedule 5.9, as of the date hereof, no authorized but unissued
or treasury shares of capital stock of the Borrower or any Subsidiary are
subject to any option, warrant, right to call or commitment of any kind or
character. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.9, neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary has any outstanding stock or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock, or any right issued to any
Person (either preemptive or other) to subscribe for or to purchase, or any
options for the purchase of, or any agreements providing for the issuance
(contingent or otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any
character relating to any of its capital stock or any stock or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for any of its capital stock


<PAGE>


other than as expressly set forth in the certificate or articles of
incorporation of the Borrower or such Subsidiary. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase
or otherwise acquire or retire any shares of its capital stock or any
convertible securities, rights or options of the type described in the preceding
sentence except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.9. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.9, as of the date hereof the Borrower does not own or hold, directly
or indirectly, any capital stock or equity security of, or any equity or
partnership interest in any Person other than such Subsidiaries.

5.10. ERISA. Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.10, neither the Borrower nor
any other member of the Controlled Group maintains any Single Employer Plans,
and no Single Employer Plan has any Unfunded Liability. Neither the Borrower nor
any other member of the Controlled Group maintains, or is obligated to
contribute to, any Multiemployer Plan or has incurred, or is reasonably expected
to incur, any withdrawal liability to any Multiemployer Plan. Each Plan complies
in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and
regulations. Neither the Borrower nor any member of the Controlled Group has,
with respect to any Plan, failed to make any contribution or pay any amount
required under Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or the terms of
such Plan. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
claims, actions, investigations or lawsuits against any Plan, any fiduciary
thereof, or the Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group with respect to a
Plan. Neither the Borrower nor any member of the Controlled Group has engaged in
any prohibited transaction (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA) in connection with any Plan which would subject such Person to any
material liability. Within the last five years neither the Borrower nor any
member of the Controlled Group has engaged in a transaction which resulted in a
Single Employer Plan with an Unfunded Liability being transferred out of the
Controlled Group. No Termination Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur with respect to any Single Employer Plan. Except for the Unfunded
Liability referenced on Schedule 5.10, there are no liabilities payable by the
Borrower or any member of the Controlled Group in respect of any employee
pension benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, after giving effect
to any indemnity payments received or to be received by any such Person, which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.11. Defaults. No Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is
continuing.

5.12. Federal Reserve Regulations. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is engaged, directly or indirectly, principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending, or arranging for the extension of,
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock. No part of the
proceeds of any Loan will be used in a manner which would violate, or result in
a violation of, Regulation G, Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X.
Neither the making of any Advance hereunder, the use of the proceeds thereof,
nor any other aspect of the financing of the Acquisition, will violate or be
inconsistent with the provisions of Regulation G, Regulation T, Regulation U or
Regulation X. Following the application of the proceeds of the Loans, less than
25% of the value (as determined by any reasonable method) of the assets of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale,
pledge, or other restriction hereunder taken as a whole have been, and will
continue to be, represented by Margin Stock.


<PAGE>


5.13. Investment Company. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is, or
after giving effect to any Advance will be, an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

5.14. Certain Fees. Other than as disclosed on Schedule 5.14, no broker's
or finder's fee or commission was, is or will be payable by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary with respect to any of the transactions (including, without
limitation, the Acquisition) contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents. The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and the Lenders
against and agrees that it will hold each of them harmless from any claim,
demand or liability for broker's or finder's fees or commissions alleged to have
been incurred by the Borrower in connection with any of the transactions
(including, without limitation, the Acquisition) contemplated by this Agreement
or the Transaction Documents and any expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent or any
Lender, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent or any Lender) arising in
connection with any such claim, demand or liability. No other similar fee or
commissions will be payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary for any other
services rendered to the Borrower or any Subsidiary ancillary to any of the
transactions (including, without limitation, the Acquisition) contemplated by
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

5.15. Solvency. As of the date hereof, both before and after giving effect
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and
the Transaction Documents and the payment of all fees, costs and expenses
payable by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents and the Transaction Documents, the Borrower
(both individually and on a consolidated basis) is Solvent.

5.16. Ownership of Properties. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.16 hereto,
on the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have a
subsisting leasehold interest in, or good and marketable title, free of all
Liens, other than those permitted by Section 6.18 or by any of the other Loan
Documents, to all of the properties and assets reflected in the Financial
Statements as being owned by it, except for assets sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date thereof.
To the knowledge of the Borrower, there are no actual, threatened or alleged
defaults with respect to any leases of real property under which the Borrower or
any Subsidiary is lessee or lessor which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries own or possess rights
to use all licenses, patents, patent applications, copyrights, service marks,
trademarks and trade names necessary to continue to conduct their business as
heretofore conducted, and no such license, patent or trademark has been declared
invalid, been limited by order of any court or by agreement or is the subject of
any infringement, interference or similar proceeding or challenge, except for
proceedings and challenges which could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

5.17. Indebtedness. Attached hereto as Schedule 5.17 is a complete and
correct list of all Indebtedness (including without limitation all Contingent
Obligations) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries outstanding on the date of
this Agreement (other than Indebtedness in a principal amount not exceeding
$25,000 for a single item of Indebtedness and $100,000 in the aggregate for all
such Indebtedness listed), showing the aggregate principal amount which was
outstanding on such


<PAGE>


date after giving effect to the Closing Transactions. The Borrower has
delivered or caused to be delivered to the Lenders a true and complete copy of
each instrument evidencing any Indebtedness listed on Schedule 5.17 and of each
document pursuant to which any of such Indebtedness was issued.

5.18. Employee Controversies. There are no strikes, work stoppages or
controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened between
the Borrower or any Subsidiary and any of its employees, other than employee
grievances arising in the ordinary course of business, which, in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.19. Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a
party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other internal
corporate restriction (a) which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect or (b) which restricts or imposes conditions upon the ability of
any Subsidiary to (i) pay dividends or make other distributions on its capital
stock, (ii) make loans or advances to the Borrower, (iii) repay loans or
advances from the Borrower or (iv) grant Liens to the Agent to secure the
Obligations. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in any agreement to which it is a party, which default
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.20. Acquisition Documents. The Borrower has delivered to each of the
Lenders true, complete and correct copies of the Acquisition Documents
(including all schedules, exhibits, annexes, amendments, supplements,
modifications, and all other documents delivered pursuant thereto or in
connection therewith). The Acquisition Documents as originally executed and
delivered by the parties thereto have not been amended, waived, supplemented or
modified without the consent of the Agent. Each of the representations and
warranties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and, to its knowledge, all other
parties therein is true and correct in all material aspects as of the date
hereof. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Borrower's
knowledge, any other party thereto is in default in the performance of or
compliance with any provisions thereof. The Acquisition is being consummated
contemporaneously with the initial Advance in accordance with applicable laws
and regulations.

5.21. Environmental Laws. There are no claims, investigations, litigation,
administrative proceedings, notices, requests for information (each a
"Proceeding"), whether pending or threatened, or judgments or orders asserting
violations of applicable federal, state and local environmental, health and
safety statutes, regulations, ordinances, codes, rules, orders, decrees,
directives and standards ("Environmental Laws") or relating to any toxic or
hazardous waste, substance or chemical or any pollutant, contaminant, chemical
or other substance defined or regulated pursuant to any Environmental Law,
including, without limitation, asbestos, petroleum, crude oil or any fraction
thereof ("Hazardous Materials"), asserted against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries which, in any case, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there are no Proceedings pending, or to
the Borrower's knowledge threatened, except as disclosed on Schedule 5.21. The
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have obtained and are in compliance in all
material respects with all permits, certificates, licenses, approvals and other
authorizations ("Environmental Permits") required for the operation of their
business and have filed all required


<PAGE>


notifications or reports relating to chemical substances, air emissions,
effluent discharges and the storage, treatment, transport and disposal of
Hazardous Materials. As of the date hereof, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries do
not have liabilities exceeding $100,000 in the aggregate for all of them with
respect to compliance with applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental
Permits or related to the generation, treatment, storage, disposal, release,
investigation or cleanup of Hazardous Materials, and no facts or circumstances
exist which could give rise to such liabilities with respect to compliance with
applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits and the generation,
treatment, storage, disposal, release, investigation or cleanup of Hazardous
Materials.

5.22. Insurance. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries maintain with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance on their Property
in such amounts and covering such risks as is consistent with sound business
practice.

5.23. Insurance Licenses. Schedule 5.23 hereto lists the jurisdiction of
domicile of each Insurance Subsidiary, all of the jurisdictions in which such
Insurance Subsidiary holds a License and is authorized to transact insurance
business, the line or lines of insurance in which such Insurance Subsidiary is
engaged and the state or states in which such Insurance Subsidiary is licensed
to engage in any line of insurance, in each case as of the date of this
Agreement. No License held by any Insurance Subsidiary or ACF, the loss of which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, is the subject
of a proceeding for suspension or revocation. To the Borrower's knowledge, there
is no sustainable basis for such suspension or revocation, and no such
suspension or revocation has been threatened by any Governmental Authority. To
the Borrower's knowledge, no Insurance Subsidiary has received written notice
from any Governmental Authority that it is deemed to be "commercially domiciled"
for insurance regulatory purposes in any jurisdiction other than that indicated
on Schedule 5.23.

5.24. Reinsurance. Schedule 5.24 lists all ceded or assumed reinsurance
agreements to which ACI is, as of the date of this Agreement, a party, which are
currently in force, and under which there is liability by either party to the
agreement (collectively, the "Existing Reinsurance Agreements"). Each of the
Existing Reinsurance Agreements is in full force and effect and is valid and
binding in all material respects in accordance with its terms, and, as of the
date hereof, ACI has not, to the Borrower's knowledge, received notice that any
other party to an in-force Existing Reinsurance Agreement will cancel or not
renew such agreement, which cancellation or nonrenewal could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower does not have knowledge
as of the date hereof that any amount recoverable by ACI pursuant to any
Existing Reinsurance Agreement is not fully collectible in due course. To the
knowledge of the Borrower, ACI is not in default in any material respect as to
any Existing Reinsurance Agreement. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.24, ACI is
entitled to take full credit in its statutory financial statements for ceded
reinsurance under the Existing Reinsurance Agreements pursuant to applicable
insurance laws. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.24, there is no claim under
any Existing Reinsurance Agreement in excess of $100,000 which is disputed by
any other party to such agreement.

5.25. Reserves. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.25, each reserve and
other material liability amount in respect of the insurance business, including,
without limitation, material reserve and other material liability amounts in
respect of insurance policies of ACI, established or reflected


<PAGE>


in the SAP Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 1996 of Old ACI,
was determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards
consistently applied, was fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial
principles and was in compliance with the requirements of the insurance laws,
rules and regulations of the State of Illinois as of the date thereof. ACI owns
assets that qualify as admitted assets under applicable law in an amount at
least equal to the sum of all such reserves and liability amounts and its
minimum Statutory Capital and Surplus as required by the insurance laws, rules
and regulations of the State of Illinois.

5.26. Disclosure. None of the (a) information, exhibits or reports
furnished or to be furnished by the Borrower or any Subsidiary to the Agent or
to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of the Loan Documents, or (b)
representations or warranties of the Borrower or any Subsidiary contained in
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Transaction Documents or any other
document, certificate or written statement furnished to the Agent or the Lenders
by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, as the
case may be, contained, contains or will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted, omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances in which the same were made. The pro forma financial
information contained in such materials is based upon good faith estimates and
assumptions believed by the Borrower to be reasonable at the time made. There is
no fact known to the Borrower (other than matters of a general economic or
political nature) that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and that has not been disclosed herein or in such other
documents, certificates and statements furnished to the Lenders for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES


8.1.  Acceleration. If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs
with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately
become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Agent
or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or the Agent
with the consent of the Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the
obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder, or declare the Obligations
to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall become
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

If, within ten Business Days after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or
entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the
Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration
and/or termination.

8.2.  Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the
Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any
Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall,
without the consent of each Lender:

(a)   Extend the final maturity of any Loan or Note or reduce the
principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
interest or fees thereon;

(b)   Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
Lenders;

(c)   Reduce the amount of or extend the date for the mandatory
payments and commitment reductions required under Section 2.1(b) or 2.7, or
increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder;

(d)   Extend the Facility Termination Date;

(e)   Amend this Section 8.2; or

(f)   Permit any assignment by the Borrower of its Obligations or
its rights hereunder.


<PAGE>


No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall be
effective without the written consent of the Agent. The Agent may waive payment
of the fee required under Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent of any
other party to this Agreement.

8.3.  Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the
making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of
the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in
the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be
available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in
full.


ARTICLE IX

GENERAL PROVISIONS

the Borrower contained in this Agreement or of the Borrower or any Subsidiary
contained in any Loan Document shall survive delivery of the Notes and the
making of the Loans herein contemplated.

contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit to the
Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

charges payable or ruled payable by any governmental authority in respect of the
Loan Documents shall be paid by the Borrower, together with interest and
penalties, if any.

of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the
provisions of the Loan Documents.

9.5.  Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and
understanding among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof other than the fee letter dated
April 18, 1997 in favor of First Chicago.

9.6.  Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to


<PAGE>


perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to
confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.

9.7.  Expenses; Indemnification. The Borrower shall reimburse the Agent
for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which attorneys may
be employees of the Agent) paid or incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, review, amendment, modification,
and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees to reimburse
the Agent and the Lenders for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket
expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent
and each Lender, which attorneys may be employees of the Agent or such Lender)
paid or incurred by the Agent or any Lender in connection with the collection
and enforcement of the Loan Documents. The Borrower further agrees to indemnify
the Agent and each Lender, its directors, officers and employees against all
losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation
therefor whether or not the Agent or any Lender is a party thereto) which any of
them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents or the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed application
of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder except to the extent that they arise out
of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking
indemnification. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

9.8.  Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents,
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with sufficient
counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders.

9.9.  Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting
Principles.

9.10. Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that
is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall,
as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without
affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation,
enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to
this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.

9.11. Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower and
the Lenders and the Agent shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither
the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the
Borrower. Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the
Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in connection with any
phase of the Borrower's business or operations. The Borrower shall rely entirely
upon its own judgment with respect to its business, and any review, inspection
or supervision of, or information supplied to the Borrower by the Agent or the
Lenders is for the protection of the Agent and the Lenders and neither the
Borrower nor any other Person is entitled to rely thereon. The Borrower


<PAGE>


agrees that neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have liability to the
Borrower (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered
by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to,
the transactions contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan
Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith,
unless it is determined by a judgment of a court that is binding on the Agent,
or such Lender, final and not subject to review on appeal, that such losses were
the result of acts or omissions on the part of the Agent or such Lender, as the
case may be, constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party
from which recovery is sought. Whether or not such damages are related to a
claim that is subject to the waiver effected above and whether or not such
waiver is effective, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability
with respect to, and the Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue
for, any special, indirect, or consequential or punitive damages suffered by the
Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby or the relationship
established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in
connection therewith.

9.12. CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS, OF THE STATE
OF ILLINOIS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

9.13. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS
TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR ILLINOIS STATE
COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS
IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH
COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO
THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT
SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE
AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER AGAINST THE
AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING,
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR
CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN CHICAGO,
ILLINOIS; PROVIDED, THAT SUCH PROCEEDINGS MAY BE BROUGHT IN OTHER COURTS IF
JURISDICTION MAY NOT BE OBTAINED IN A COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

9.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY
WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY
WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR


<PAGE>


CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

9.15. Disclosure. The Borrower and each Lender hereby (a) acknowledge and
agree that First Chicago and/or its Affiliates from time to time may hold other
investments in, make other loans to or have other relationships with the
Borrower, including, without limitation, in connection with any interest rate
hedging instruments or agreements or swap transactions, and (b) waive any
liability of First Chicago or such Affiliate to the Borrower or any Lender,
respectively, arising out of or resulting from any conflict of interest arising
from such investments, loans or relationships.

9.16. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and
any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such
counterpart. This Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Agent that
it has taken such action.


ARTICLE X

THE AGENT


10.1. Appointment. First Chicago is hereby appointed Agent hereunder and
under each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders authorizes the Agent to
act as the agent of such Lender. The Agent agrees to act as such upon the
express conditions contained in this Article X. The Agent shall not have a
fiduciary relationship in respect of the Borrower or any Lender by reason of
this Agreement.

10.2. Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the
Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each
thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder, except any action specifically provided
by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

10.3. General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower or any Lender for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except for its or
their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

10.4. No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty
or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder, (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition


<PAGE>


specified in Article IV, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the
Agent and not waived at closing, or (d) the validity, effectiveness,
sufficiency, enforceability or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other
instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith. The Agent shall have no
duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished
by the Borrower to the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the
Borrower to the Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual
capacity).

10.5. Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any
other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders (or, to the extent required by Section 8.2, all Lenders), and
such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall
be binding on all of the Lenders and on all holders of Notes. The Agent shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under
any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction
by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it
may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

10.6. Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of its
duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its
duties hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

10.7. Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to
legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

10.8. Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (a) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (b) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents, and
(c) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in
any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document
delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or
the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any such other documents;
provided, that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent
they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent. The
obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the
Obligations and termination of this Agreement.


<PAGE>


10.9. Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder unless
the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to
this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such
a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

10.10. Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a
Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its
individual capacity. The Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such
Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The
Agent, in its individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

10.11. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

10.12. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective
upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent has been
appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have
the right to appoint, on behalf of the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within thirty days after the resigning Agent's
giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint,
on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If the Agent has
resigned and no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all
the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in
respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes
shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor Agent shall be deemed to be
appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has accepted the appointment. Any
such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained
earnings of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the resigning Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent,
the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its further duties and obligations
hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the
resignation of an Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.

ARTICLE XI

SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS


11.1. Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the
Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default or Unmatured Default occurs, any and all deposits
(including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not
collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by
any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and
applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or
not the Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due.

11.2. Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has
payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to
Section 2.18(a), 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater proportion than its pro-rata
share of such Loans, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a
portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each
Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender, whether in
connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise,
receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts
which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such
collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans. In case any such payment is
disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall
be made. If an amount to be setoff is to be applied to Indebtedness of the
Borrower to a Lender, other than Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Notes held
by such Lender, such amount shall be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness
and to the Indebtedness evidenced by such Notes.


ARTICLE XII

BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS


12.1. Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (a) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents, and (b) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3. Notwithstanding clause (b) of this Section, any Lender may at
any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the Agent, assign all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Notes to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank shall
release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Agent may
treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless
and until such payee complies with Section 12.3 in the case of an assignment
thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer
is filed with the Agent. Any assignee or transferee of


<PAGE>


a Note agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by all the terms and provisions
of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at
the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the
holder of any Note, shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder,
transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange
therefor.

12.2. Participations.

12.2.1. Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any
Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan
Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests
to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain
the holder of any such Note for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all
amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if
such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower and the
Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

12.2.2. Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to
approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment,
modification or waiver which effects any of the modifications referenced in
clauses (a) through (f) of Section 8.2.

12.2.3. Benefit of Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect
of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the
same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly
to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents; provided, that each Lender shall
retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount
of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share
with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff
provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received
pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in
accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.

12.3. Assignments.

12.3.1. Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign
to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of its
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents; provided, however, that in the
case of an assignment to an entity which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a
Lender, such assignment shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000. Such
assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto or in such
other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Agent
and, so long as no Default is continuing, the Borrower


<PAGE>


shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a
Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof. Such consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

12.3.2. Effect; Effective Date. Upon (a) delivery to the Agent of a
notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit I to Exhibit
C hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents required by
Section 12.3.1, and (b) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such
assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the effective date
specified in such Notice of Assignment. On and after the effective date of such
assignment, (a) such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this
Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all
the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same
extent as if it were an original party hereto, and (b) the transferor Lender
shall be released with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and
Loans assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the
Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and
the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that replacement Notes are
issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement
Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts
reflecting their Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

12.4. Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to
disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, subject,
to the extent applicable, to Section 12.5.

12.5. Confidentiality. Each Lender shall hold all information relating to
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries obtained by such Lender pursuant to this
agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 6.9) in confidence
in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for handling information
of this nature, except to the extent such information (a) was or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the
Lender or (b) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that such source is not
bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Borrower or such Subsidiary known
to such Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender may make such
disclosure (i) as is reasonably required by any actual or prospective Transferee
in connection with the transfer of, or participation in, any Loans hereunder,
provided that such actual or prospective Transferee executes an agreement for
the benefit of the Borrower with such Lender containing provisions substantially
identical to those contained in this Section 12.5, (ii) at the request or
pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority to which the Lender is
subject or in connection with an examination of such Lender by any such
authority, (iii) pursuant to subpoena or other court process, provided that if
not prohibited by law, such Lender will use its best efforts to provide notice
to the Borrower of the receipt of such subpoena prior to delivering confidential
material in response thereto, (iv) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable requirement of law, (v) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation or proceeding with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby to which the Agent or any Lender or their
respective Affiliates may be party, (vi) to the extent reasonably required in
connection with


<PAGE>


the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (vii) to
such Lender's independent auditors and other professional advisors with a need
to know and who agree to keep such information confidential to the extent
required of such Lender hereunder, (viii) as to any Lender or its Affiliate, as
expressly permitted under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding
confidentiality to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is party or is deemed
party with such Lender or such Affiliate and (ix) to its Affiliates, provided
that any such Affiliate agrees in writing to keep such information confidential
to the same extent required of such Lender hereunder.

12.6. Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred
to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause
such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply
with the provisions of Section 2.18.

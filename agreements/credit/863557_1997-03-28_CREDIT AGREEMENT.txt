THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

SECTION 2.1 The Commitment.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each
Bank, severally and not jointly,  agrees to make advances of its Revolving Loans
to the Borrower,  at any time and from time to time on and after the date hereof
and until the earlier of (i) the Maturity  Date or (ii) the  termination  of the
Commitment  of  said  Bank,  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  at  any  time
outstanding  not to exceed  such Bank's  Commitment,  subject,  however,  to the
conditions that (A) at no time shall the outstanding  aggregate principal amount
of all Borrowings made by all Banks pursuant to their Revolving Loans,  together
with the Letter of Credit Balance, exceed the Maximum Commitment, and (B) at all
times the outstanding  aggregate  principal amount of all Borrowings advanced by
each Bank  pursuant  to its  Revolving  Loans shall equal the product of (y) the
percentage which its Commitment  represents of the Maximum  Commitment times (z)
the outstanding  aggregate  principal  amount of all Borrowings  advanced by all
Banks pursuant to their Revolving  Loans.  Such Commitments may be terminated or
reduced  from  time to time  pursuant  to  Sections  2.10 and 2.20.  Within  the
foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow hereunder,
on and after the date  hereof  and prior to the  Maturity  Date,  subject to the
terms, conditions and limitations set forth herein.

(b) Each advance of the proceeds of the Revolving  Loans shall
constitute  a single  Borrowing.  Each such  Borrowing  shall be in a  principal
amount  which  is  an  integral  multiple  of  $100,000.00  and  not  less  than
$1,000,000.00 (or, if less, a principal amount equal to the remaining balance of
the available Commitments).

SECTION 2.2  [Intentionally left blank]

SECTION 2.3  Procedures for Borrowings Under the Revolving Loans.

(a) Each advance under the  Revolving  Loans shall be a single
LIBOR  Borrowing or a single Base Rate  Borrowing,  as the Borrower may request.
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time;  provided,
however,  that (i) the Borrower  shall not be entitled to request any  Borrowing
which,  if  made,  would  result  in an  aggregate  of more  than  ten  separate
Borrowings being outstanding  collectively  under the Revolving Loans at any one
time and (ii) each LIBOR  Borrowing  shall be in a principal  amount which is an
integral multiple of $100,000.00 and not less than  $1,000,000.00.  For purposes
of the foregoing,  Borrowings having different  Interest Periods,  regardless of
whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

(b) In order to request a Borrowing,  the Borrower  shall give
to the  Administrative  Agent written or telecopy  notice (or  telephone  notice
promptly  confirmed  in writing or by  telecopy)  in the form of Exhibit  "B" (a
"Borrowing Notice") not later than 9:00 a.m., Arizona time, (a) in the
<PAGE>
case of a LIBOR Borrowing,  three Business days before a proposed  Borrowing and
(b) in the case of a Base Rate  Borrowing,  on the day of a proposed  Borrowing.
Each Borrowing  Notice shall be  irrevocable  and shall in each case specify (i)
whether the Borrowing then being  requested is to be a LIBOR Borrowing or a Base
Rate Borrowing;  (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day)
and the amount thereof; (iii) if such Borrowing is to be a LIBOR Borrowing,  the
Interest Period with respect thereto; and (iv) if such Borrowing is to refinance
all or any part of any  outstanding  Borrowing,  the identity and amount of such
Borrowing that the Borrower requests to be refinanced.  If no election as to the
Type of  Borrowing  is specified in any  Borrowing  Notice,  then the  requested
Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Borrowing.  If no Interest Period with respect to
any LIBOR  Borrowing  is specified in any  Borrowing  Notice,  then the Borrower
shall be deemed to have  selected  an Interest  Period of one month's  duration.
Subject  to  Section  2.11,  if the  Borrower  shall  not have  given  notice in
accordance  with this  Section of its  election to  refinance a LIBOR  Borrowing
prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect for such  Borrowing,  then the
Borrower  (unless such  Borrowing is repaid at the end of such Interest  Period)
shall be deemed to have given notice of an election to refinance  such Borrowing
with a Base Rate Borrowing.

SECTION 2.4  Loans.

(a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing made by the
Banks ratably in accordance with their Commitments;  provided, however, that the
failure of any Bank to make any Loan shall not in itself  relieve any other Bank
of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood,  however, that no Bank
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make any Loan required
to be made by such other Bank).

(b) Each Bank shall make any LIBOR Borrowing by causing either
at its option any domestic branch or the Eurodollar  Lending Office of such Bank
to make such Loan;  provided  that any  exercise of such option shall not affect
the  obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance  with the terms
of this Agreement and the Note.

(c) Subject to Section 2.3,  each Bank shall make each Loan to
be made by it  hereunder  on the  proposed  date  thereof  by wire  transfer  of
immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent in Phoenix, Arizona, not
later than 11:30 a.m., Arizona time, and the Administrative Agent shall by 12:00
noon,  Arizona  time,  credit the amounts so  received  to the  general  deposit
account of the Borrower with the Administrative  Agent (or such other account as
the  Borrower  may  designate)  or, if a Borrowing  shall not occur on such date
because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return
the  amounts so  received to the  respective  Banks.  Loans shall be made by the
Banks pro rata in accordance with Section 2.16. Unless the Administrative  Agent
shall have received  notice from a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing  that
such  Bank will not make  available  to the  Administrative  Agent  such  Bank's
portion of any future Borrowing,  the Administrative  Agent may assume that such
Bank has made such portion available to the Administrative  Agent on the date of
such  Borrowing in accordance  with this  paragraph  (c) and the  Administrative
Agent may, in reliance upon such  assumption,  make available to the Borrower on
such date a corresponding  amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not
have made such portion available to the Administrative  Agent, such Bank and the
Borrower severally agree to repay
<PAGE>
to the  Administrative  Agent  forthwith  on demand  such  corresponding  amount
together with interest  thereon,  for each day from the date such amount is made
available  to  the  Borrower  until  the  date  such  amount  is  repaid  to the
Administrative  Agent  at (i) in the case of the  Borrower,  the  interest  rate
applicable at the time to the Loans  comprising  such  Borrowing and (ii) in the
case of such Bank,  the  Federal  Funds  Rate.  If such Bank shall  repay to the
Administrative  Agent such  corresponding  amount,  such amount shall constitute
such Bank's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) In the  event  a Bank  fails  to  make  its  portion  of a
Borrowing, Borrower may request in writing to the Administrative Agent that such
portion be advanced by the remaining Banks. So long as no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing and so long as the aggregate principal amount of
each Bank's Revolving Loans after giving effect to the additional Loan would not
exceed its  Commitment,  the  remaining  Banks shall make Loans in the amount of
such portion pro rata in accordance with Section 2.16.

SECTION 2.5  Refinancings.  Subject to Section  2.11,  the Borrower may
refinance  all or any part of any  Borrowing  with a Borrowing  of the same or a
different  Type made  pursuant to Section  2.3,  and at any time may combine all
Base Rate  Borrowings  into a single  Borrowing,  subject to the  conditions and
limitations set forth herein and elsewhere in this  Agreement.  Any Borrowing or
part thereof so  refinanced  or combined  shall be deemed to have been repaid in
accordance with Section 2.7 with the proceeds of a new Borrowing hereunder,  and
the proceeds of the new Borrowing (except to the extent, if any, they exceed the
principal amount of the Borrowing(s) being refinanced) shall not be disbursed to
the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.4(c).

SECTION 2.6  Fees.

(a) The  Borrower  agrees  to pay to each  Bank,  through  the
Administrative  Agent, (i) quarterly in arrears for each calendar quarter ending
each March 31, June 30,  September  30 and December 31, on a date not later than
five Business Days after such calendar  quarter has ended,  commencing  December
31, 1996 and (ii) on the date on which the  respective  Commitment  of such Bank
shall be  terminated  as  provided  herein,  for the period  from the end of the
preceding  calendar  quarter to the date of such  termination,  a commitment fee
(each a "Commitment  Fee") on a prorated  basis at a rate per annum equal to the
Applicable Margin as to the Commitment Fee on the Average Adjusted Daily Undrawn
Balance during the preceding  calendar quarter (or shorter period (1) commencing
with the date hereof or (2) ending with the  Maturity  Date or any other date on
which  the  respective  Commitment  of  such  Bank  shall  be  terminated).  All
Commitment  Fees shall be  computed  on the basis of the  actual  number of days
elapsed  in a year of 360  days.  The  Commitment  Fees due to each  Bank  shall
commence  to accrue on the date  hereof and shall cease to accrue on the earlier
of the Maturity Date and the termination of the respective Commitment of Bank as
provided herein.

(b) All Fees shall be paid to each Bank on the dates  due,  in
Dollars  in  immediately   available  funds  to  the  Administrative  Agent  for
distribution, if and or appropriate, among the Banks.
<PAGE>
Once paid,  any Fees paid to any Bank in advance  shall only be  refundable by a
Bank if such Bank fails to make any Loan in accordance with its Commitment.

(c) The Borrower  agrees to pay to the  Administrative  Agent,
for its own account,  any fee provided for in the Fee Letter (the "Agency  Fee")
at the times provided therein.

(d) Of the Letter  Credit  Fee paid to the  Issuing  Bank,  an
amount  equal to the LIBOR  Borrowing  Applicable  Margin  shall be paid to each
Bank, through the Administrative Agent on a prorated basis.

SECTION 2.7 Notes;  Repayment of Revolving  Loans.  The Revolving  Loan
made by each Bank shall be  evidenced  by a  separate  Note duly  completed  and
executed on behalf of the Borrower, dated the date of said Bank's Commitment, in
the form of Exhibit C hereto,  payable to the order of such Bank in a  principal
amount equal to said Bank's  Commitment.  Each Note shall bear interest from the
date  thereof  on the  outstanding  principal  balance  thereof  as set forth in
Section 2.8. Each Bank may (and is hereby  authorized  by the Borrower,  at said
Bank's  discretion,  to) endorse on a schedule attached to the Note held by such
Bank (or on a continuation of such schedule  attached to each such Note and made
a part  thereof),  or otherwise to record in such Bank's  internal  records,  an
appropriate  notation evidencing the date and amount of each Borrowing under the
Revolving Loan of such Bank, each payment or prepayment of principal of any such
Borrowing and the other  information  provided for on such  schedule;  provided,
however,  that the  failure  of any Bank to make  such a  notation  or any error
therein shall not in any manner  affect the  obligation of the Borrower to repay
each  Borrowing  under the Revolving  Loans in accordance  with the terms of the
Notes.

SECTION 2.8 Interest on Revolving Loans.

(a) Subject to the  provisions of Sections 2.9 and 2.11,  each
LIBOR Borrowing shall bear interest  (computed on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to, the LIBOR
Rate for the  Interest  Period  in  effect  for such  LIBOR  Borrowing  plus the
Applicable  Margin.  Interest on each LIBOR  Borrowing  shall be payable on each
applicable  Interest Payment Date. The LIBOR Rate for each Interest Period shall
be determined by the Administrative  Agent, and such determination shall be made
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.  The  Administrative  Agent
shall promptly advise the Borrower and each Bank of such determination.

(b) Subject to the  provisions of Sections 2.9 and 2.11,  each
Base Rate  Borrowing  shall bear  interest  (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days  elapsed  over a year of 360 days,  as the case may be) at a rate
per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the  Applicable  Margin.  Interest on each
Base Rate Borrowing shall be payable on each applicable  Interest  Payment Date.
The  Base  Rate  shall  be  determined  by the  Administrative  Agent  and  such
determination shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
The  Administrative  Agent shall  promptly  advise the Borrower and each Bank of
such determination.
<PAGE>
SECTION 2.9 Default  Interest.  If the  Borrower  shall  default in the
payment of the  principal  of or  interest  on any  Revolving  Loan or any other
amount  becoming  due  hereunder,  whether  by  scheduled  maturity,  notice  of
prepayment, acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower shall on demand from time to
time pay interest,  to the extent  permitted by law, on such defaulted amount up
to (but not  including  the date of  actual  payment  (after  as well as  before
judgment) at the Default Rate.

SECTION 2.10 Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

(a) The Commitment  shall be  automatically  terminated on the
Maturity Date. The Borrower,  however,  has the right to request,  upon at least
sixty (60) days written notice to each Bank prior to each Anniversary  Date, the
extension  of the Maturity  Date for an  additional  one year period;  provided,
however,  that approval of any such extension  shall be at the sole and absolute
discretion  of the Banks and any such  approval  shall  require the  affirmative
consent of all Banks.

(b) Upon at  least  three  Business  Days'  prior  irrevocable
written or telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, Borrower may at any time
in whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce,
each such  Commitment;  provided,  however,  that each partial  reduction of the
Maximum  Commitment  shall be in an integral  multiple of  $100,000.00  and in a
minimum  principal  amount of  $1,000,000.00;  and  provided  further,  that the
Borrower  shall not be permitted  to terminate or reduce the Maximum  Commitment
if, as a result  respectively,  the aggregate  principal amount of the Revolving
Loans together with the Letter of Credit  Balance  outstanding  hereunder  would
exceed such reduced amount of the Maximum Commitment.

SECTION 2.11 Conversion and  Continuation  of Borrowings.  The Borrower
shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  upon  prior  irrevocable  notice  to the
Administrative  Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Arizona time, (i) on the day of
conversion,  to convert any LIBOR  Borrowing  into a Base Rate  Borrowing,  (ii)
three  Business Days prior to conversion  or  continuation,  to convert any Base
Rate  Borrowing into a LIBOR  Borrowing or to continue any LIBOR  Borrowing as a
LIBOR Borrowing for an additional Interest Period, and (iii) three Business Days
prior to  conversion,  to convert the Interest  Period with respect to any LIBOR
Borrowing to another  permissible  Interest Period,  subject in each case to the
following:

Borrowing  shall be converted or continued,  the aggregate  principal  amount of
such  Borrowing  converted  or  continued  shall  be  an  integral  multiple  of
$100,000.00 and not less than $1,000,000.00;

(b) each conversion shall be effected by the Banks by applying
the  proceeds  of the  new  Borrowing  resulting  from  such  conversion  to the
Borrowing (or portion thereof) being converted;  accrued interest on a Borrowing
(or portion  thereof) being  converted shall be paid by the Borrower at the time
of conversion;

(c) any LIBOR  Borrowing  may be converted  only at the end of
the Interest Period applicable thereto;
<PAGE>
(d) any  portion of a  Borrowing  maturing  or  required to be
repaid in less than one month may not be converted  into or continued as a LIBOR
Borrowing;

(e) any portion of a LIBOR Borrowing which cannot be continued
as a  LIBOR  Borrowing  by  reason  of  clauses  (c)  and  (d)  above  shall  be
automatically  converted  at the end of the  Interest  Period in effect for such
Borrowing into a Base Rate Borrowing; and

(f) each  conversion  or  continuation  shall be made pro rata
among the Banks in  accordance  with the  respective  principal  amounts  of the
converted or continued Borrowings.

Each notice  pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable and
shall refer to this  Agreement  and specify (i) the  identity  and amount of the
Borrowing  that the Borrower  requests be converted or  continued,  (ii) whether
such Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing or a Base
Rate  Borrowing,  (iii) if such notice  requests a conversion,  the date of such
conversion  (which shall be a Business Day) and (iv) if such  Borrowing is to be
converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect
thereto.  If no Interest  Period is specified in any such notice with respect to
any conversion to or  continuation as a LIBOR  Borrowing,  the Borrower shall be
deemed  to have  selected  an  Interest  Period  of one  month's  duration.  The
Administrative  Agent shall advise the other Banks of any notice given  pursuant
to this  Section  and of each  Bank's  portion  of any  converted  or  continued
Borrowing.  If the Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance  with this
Section to continue any LIBOR  Borrowing into a subsequent  Interest Period (and
shall not otherwise have given notice in accordance with this Section to convert
such  Borrowing),  such  Borrowing  shall,  at the  end of the  Interest  Period
applicable  thereto (unless repaid pursuant to the terms hereof),  automatically
be continued as a Base Rate Borrowing.

SECTION 2.12  Prepayment.

(a) The  Borrower  shall  have the  right at any time and from
time to time to prepay  any  Borrowing,  in whole or in part,  upon  written  or
telecopy notice (or telephone  notice promptly  confirmed by written or telecopy
notice) to the Administrative  Agent, such notice to be three Business Days with
respect to a LIBOR  Borrowing  and one  Business Day with respect to a Base Rate
Borrowing; provided, however, that each partial prepayment shall be in an amount
which is an integral multiple of $100,000.00 and not less than $1,000,000.00.

(b) On the date of any termination or reduction of the Maximum
Commitment  pursuant to Section 2.10, the Borrower shall pay or prepay an amount
of the  Revolving  Loan such that the sum of the aggregate  principal  amount of
such Loan outstanding together with the Letter of Credit Balance will not exceed
the respective Commitment after giving effect to such termination or reduction.

(c) Each notice of  prepayment  shall  specify the  prepayment
date and the  principal  amount of each  Borrowing  (or  portion  thereof) to be
prepaid,  shall be  irrevocable  and shall  commit the  Borrower  to prepay such
Borrowing (or portion  thereof) by the amount stated  therein on the date stated
therein. All prepayments under this Section shall be subject to Section 2.15 but
otherwise
<PAGE>
without  premium  or  penalty.  All  prepayments  under  this  Section  shall be
accompanied by a payment of accrued  interest on the amount being prepaid to the
date of payment.

SECTION 2.13  Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances.

(a) If any Bank shall have  determined that the adoption after
the date hereof of any law,  rule,  regulation  or guideline  regarding  capital
adequacy,  or any change after the date hereof in any of the foregoing or in the
interpretation  or  administration  of any of the foregoing by any  Governmental
Authority,  central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or any Lending Office of such
Bank) or any Bank's  holding  company with any request or directive  promulgated
after the date  hereof  regarding  capital  adequacy  (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such  Governmental  Authority,  central bank or  comparable
agency,  has or would  have the  effect of  reducing  the rate of return on such
Bank's  or on  the  capital  of  such  Bank's  holding  company,  if  any,  as a
consequence  of this  Agreement,  the  issuance  of a Letter  of  Credit  or the
Revolving  Loan made by such Bank to a level  below that which such Bank or such
Bank's  holding  company  could have achieved but for such  adoption,  change or
compliance  (taking into  consideration such Bank's policies and the policies of
such Bank's  holding  company  with  respect to capital  adequacy)  by an amount
deemed by such  Bank in good  faith to be  material,  then from time to time the
Borrower  shall pay to such  Bank such  additional  amount  or  amounts  as will
compensate  such Bank or such  Bank's  holding  company  for any such  reduction
suffered, except that Borrower shall not be obligated to compensate any Bank for
any costs  associated with an increase in its  administrative  burden  resulting
from any such adoption, change or compliance.

(b)  Notwithstanding  any other provision herein, if after the
date of this Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation (either by way
of changes in existing laws or regulations or the  introductions  of new laws or
regulations)  or  in  the  interpretation  or  administration   thereof  by  any
Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof
(whether  or not having the force of law) shall  change the basis of taxation of
payments to any Bank of the principal of or interest on any LIBOR Borrowing made
by such Bank,  Fees or other amounts  payable  hereunder  (other than changes in
respect  of taxes  imposed  on the net income of such  Bank),  or shall  impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve,  special  deposit or similar  requirement
against  assets of,  deposits  with or for the account of or credit  extended by
such Bank,  including  without  limitation any reserve  requirement  that may be
applicable to "eurocurrency  liabilities"  under and as defined in Regulation D,
or shall impose on such Bank or the London  interbank market any other condition
affecting  this  Agreement  or any LIBOR  Borrowing  made by such Bank,  and the
result of any of the  foregoing  shall be to  increase  the cost to such Bank of
making or  maintaining  any LIBOR  Borrowing  or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable  by such Bank  hereunder or under the Note (in respect of
LIBOR Borrowing only), whether of principal, interest or otherwise, by an amount
deemed by such Bank in good faith to be material, then, the Borrower will pay to
such Bank upon demand such additional  amount or amounts as will compensate such
Bank for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
<PAGE>
(c) A  certificate  of a Bank  setting  forth  such  amount or
amounts as shall be necessary to compensate  such Bank or its holding company as
specified in paragraph  (a) or (b) above,  as the case may be, and setting forth
in reasonable  detail the manner in which such amount or amounts shall have been
determined  shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be made on a reasonable
basis.  The  Borrower  shall pay each Bank the  amount  shown as due on any such
certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

(d) Failure on the part of any Bank to demand compensation for
any increased costs or reduction in amounts  received or receivable with respect
to any  period  shall not  constitute  a waiver of said  Bank's  right to demand
compensation with respect to such period or any other period.  The protection of
this  Section  shall  be  available  to any  Bank  regardless  of  any  possible
contention of the invalidity or  inapplicability  of the law, rule,  regulation,
guideline  or other  change or  condition  which  shall  have  occurred  or been
imposed,  provided that if such Bank is compensated  for such increased costs or
reduction  by any  Governmental  Authority  or  third  party in the  event  such
invalidity or inapplicability is finally determined, then such Bank shall return
to Borrower the respective  compensation  paid by Borrower,  up to the lesser of
such amount as is received by such Bank or such amount as was paid by Borrower.

(e) Without  prejudice to the survival of any other  agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section shall
survive Termination,  provided that Borrower shall have no further obligation to
the Banks under this Section  unless a  certificate  setting forth the amount of
such obligation shall have been delivered by the Banks pursuant to paragraph (c)
above within ninety (90) calendar days after the Termination Date.

(f) Each  Bank or the  Administrative  Agent on  behalf of the
Banks shall give  notification to the Borrower of any event or prospective event
which will give rise to the operation of paragraphs  (a) or (b) of this Section,
such  notification  to be sent within thirty (30) days of the date of the public
promulgation of the effective date of any such law, rule, regulation, guidelines
or change therein.

(g)   Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions  herein  to  the
contrary,  if after  receipt  of any  notice  from a Bank that the  Borrower  is
obligated to pay  additional  amounts to the Bank pursuant to any change arising
under  Section  2.13(a)  or (b),  Borrower  shall  have the  option to prepay or
convert any Borrowing  adversely  affected by any change  described in Paragraph
(a) or (b) of this  section  within seven (7) days of receipt of any such notice
from a Bank,  without the  obligation  to pay to such Bank with  respect to such
prepayment or conversion any amount or amounts otherwise payable to such Bank by
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.13

SECTION 2.14 Change in Legality.

(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change
in any law or regulation or in the  interpretation  thereof by any  Governmental
Authority charged with the  administration or interpretation  thereof shall make
it unlawful  for any Bank to make or  maintain  any LIBOR  Borrowing  or to give
effect to its  obligations  as  contemplated  hereby  with  respect to any
<PAGE>
LIBOR  Borrowing,  then by  written  notice  to the  Borrower  setting  forth in
reasonable detail the relevant  circumstances and the effect thereof,  such Bank
may:

(i) declare that LIBOR Borrowings will not thereafter
be made by such Bank  hereunder,  whereupon any request by the Borrower
for a LIBOR  Borrowing  shall  be  deemed  a  request  for a Base  Rate
Borrowing unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

(ii) require that all  outstanding  LIBOR  Borrowings
made by it be  converted  to Base Rate  Borrowings,  in which event all
such LIBOR  Borrowings  shall be  automatically  converted to Base Rate
Borrowings  as of the  effective  date of such  notice as  provided  in
paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Bank shall  exercise  its rights  under (i) or (ii) above,  all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to
repay  the  LIBOR  Borrowings  that  would  have  been  made by such Bank or the
converted  LIBOR  Borrowings  of such Bank shall instead be applied to repay the
Base  Rate  Borrowings  made by such  Bank in lieu  of,  or  resulting  from the
conversion of, such LIBOR Borrowings.

(b) For purposes of this Section,  a notice to the Borrower by
any Bank shall be effective as to each LIBOR Borrowing,  if lawful,  on the last
day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such LIBOR Borrowing;  in all
other  cases  such  notice  shall be  effective  on the date of  receipt  by the
Borrower.

(c) Each  Bank  shall  use its  best  efforts  to give  prompt
notification  to the Borrower of any event or prospective  event which will give
rise to the operation of paragraph (a) of this Section.

SECTION 2.15 Redeployment  Loss. The Borrower shall pay to each Bank on
demand against any Redeployment Loss (defined below) arising as a consequence of
any payment, prepayment, failure to borrow or convert to a LIBOR Borrowing after
giving notice of its intent to so borrow or convert  pursuant to Sections 2.3(b)
or 2.11, or conversion of a LIBOR  Borrowing  required by any other provision of
this  Agreement or  otherwise  made or deemed made on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period applicable  thereto.  "Redeployment Loss" shall mean,
in each  circumstance,  the amount  which is the sum of the  discounted  monthly
differences  for each month from the month of  prepayment  through  the month in
which such LIBOR Borrowing matures, calculated as follows for each such month:

(a) Determine the amount of interest which would have
accrued  each  month  on  the  amount  prepaid  at  the  interest  rate
applicable  to such amount had it remained  outstanding  until the last
day of the LIBOR Borrowing applicable thereto.

(b) Subtract from the amount  determined in (a) above
the amount of interest  which would have  accrued for the same month on
the amount  prepaid for
<PAGE>
the remaining term of such LIBOR  Borrowing at the LIBOR Rate in effect
on the date of prepayment for new loans in a principal  amount equal to
the amount prepaid made for such term.

(c) If the  result  obtained  in (b) for any month is
greater than zero,  discount that  difference by the LIBOR Rate used in
(b) above.

A  certificate  of any Bank  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail any amount or
amounts  which Bank is entitled to receive  pursuant to this Section and setting
forth in  reasonable  detail the manner in which  such  amounts  shall have been
determined  shall be delivered to the  Borrower  and shall be  reasonably  made.
Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement  contained herein,  the
agreements and obligations  contained in this Section shall survive  Termination
provided that Borrower  shall have no further  obligation to any Bank under this
Section unless a certificate  setting forth the amount of such obligation  shall
have been  delivered  by such Bank  pursuant to the  preceding  sentence  within
ninety (90) calendar days after the Termination Date.

SECTION 2.16 Pro Rata Treatment.  Except as required under Section 2.14
or permitted by Section  2.20,  each  Borrowing,  each payment or  prepayment of
principal of any Borrowing,  each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment
of the Fees,  each  reduction of the  Commitments  and each  refinancing  of any
Borrowing  with a Borrowing of any Type,  shall be allocated  pro rata among the
Banks in accordance with their  respective  Commitments (or, if such Commitments
shall  have  expired  or been  terminated,  in  accordance  with the  respective
principal  amounts  of  their  outstanding  Loans).  Each  Bank  agrees  that in
computing  such  Bank's  portion  of any  Borrowing  to be made  hereunder,  the
Administrative  Agent may, in its  discretion,  round each Bank's  percentage of
such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.

SECTION  2.17  Sharing of  Setoffs.  Each Bank agrees that if it shall,
through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against
the  Borrower,  or pursuant to a secured  claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of
the United  States Code or other  security or interest  arising from, or in lieu
of, such secured claim,  received by such Bank under any applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency  or other  similar law or  otherwise,  or by any other means,  obtain
payment  (voluntary or  involuntary) in respect of any Loan or Loans as a result
of which  the  unpaid  principal  portion  of the  Loans of such  Bank  shall be
proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans of any other
Bank, it shall be deemed  simultaneously  to have purchased from such other Bank
at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Bank the purchase price for,
a  participation  in the Loans of such other Bank, so that the aggregate  unpaid
principal amount of the Loans and  participations in the Loans held by each Bank
shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate  unpaid principal amount of all
Loans  then  outstanding  as the  principal  amount of its  Loans  prior to such
exercise  of banker's  lien,  setoff or  counterclaim  or other event was to the
principal  amount of all Loans  outstanding  prior to such  exercise of banker's
lien,  setoff or counterclaim or other event;  provided,  however,  that, if any
such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section
and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase
or purchases or  adjustments  shall be rescinded to the extent of such  recovery
and the purchase price or prices or adjustment  restored without  interest.  The
Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that
<PAGE>
any Bank holding a participation  in a Loan deemed to have been so purchased may
exercise  any and all  rights of  banker's  lien,  setoff or  counterclaim  with
respect  to any and all  moneys  owing by the  Borrower  to such  Bank by reason
thereof as fully as if such Bank had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the
amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.18  Payments.

(a) The Borrower  shall make each payment  (including  without
limitation  principal  of or  interest  on any  Borrowing  or any  Fees or other
amounts)  hereunder  and under any other Loan Document no later than 12:00 noon,
Arizona time, on the date when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at its
offices at 201 Third Street, San Francisco,  California 94103, Attention: Agency
Department,  or at such other  location as it may direct the Borrower in writing
to  use,  in  immediately   available   funds.   Any  payment  received  by  the
Administrative  Agent after 12:00 noon,  Arizona  time,  shall be deemed to have
been received by Administrative Agent on the next Business Day.

(b)  Whenever  any  payment   (including   without  limitation
principal  of or  interest  on any  Borrowing  or any  Fees  or  other  amounts)
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise  would
occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next
succeeding  Business  Day,  and such  extension  of time  shall in such  case be
included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

SECTION 2.19  Taxes.

(a) All payments by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be
made without setoff or  counterclaim  and in such amounts as may be necessary in
order that all such payments after deduction or withholding for or on account of
any present or future taxes,  levies,  imposts,  duties,  withholdings  or other
charges of whatsoever  nature and all liabilities  with respect  thereto,  other
than any taxes on or measured  by the gross or net income of a Bank  pursuant to
(i) the income and/or franchise tax laws of the jurisdictions in which such Bank
is  incorporated  or organized or in which the principal  office of such Bank or
the branch that is a party to this  Agreement of that Bank is located,  and (ii)
the income and/or  franchise tax laws of the  jurisdictions in which the Lending
Office or the Eurodollar  Lending Office of that Bank are then located (all such
nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts,  duties,  withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter  referred  to as  "Taxes"),  shall  not be  less  than  the  amounts
otherwise  specified  to be paid by the  Borrower  to or for the  account of the
Administrative   Agent  or  Bank  (or  any  transferee  or  assignee   (each,  a
"Transferee"))  under this  Agreement.  Upon request of the Borrower in writing,
each Bank shall  designate  a different  Lending  Office or  Eurodollar  Lending
Office,  as the case may be, if such  designation  will avoid the  imposition of
Taxes and if such  designation  will not, in the sole  judgment of such Bank, be
otherwise  disadvantageous  to such  Bank.  With  respect to each  deduction  or
withholding  for or on account of any Taxes of the  Administrative  Agent or any
Bank (or  Transferee),  Borrower shall promptly (and in any event not later than
45 days thereafter) furnish to such Administrative Agent or Bank (or Transferee)
a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
<PAGE>
(b) In  addition,  the  Borrower  agrees to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar  levies  which  arise from any  payment  made  hereunder  or from the
execution,  delivery or  registration  of, or  otherwise  with  respect to, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Stamp Taxes").
Each Bank that is organized  outside the United States  represents  and warrants
that as of the  Closing  Date,  it is not aware of any Stamp Tax  imposed by the
jurisdiction in which it is  incorporated  that applies to this Agreement or any
payment made to such Bank hereunder.

(c) The Borrower will indemnify each Bank (or  Transferee) and
the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Stamp Taxes (including
without  limitation  any Taxes or Stamp  Taxes  imposed by any  jurisdiction  on
amounts  payable under this Section)  paid by such Bank (or  Transferee)  or the
Administrative  Agent, as the case may be, and any liability  (including without
limitation  penalties,  interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto,  whether or not such Taxes or Stamp  Taxes  were  correctly  or legally
asserted by the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority.  Such
indemnification  shall  be made  within  30 days  after  the  date  any Bank (or
Transferee)  or the  Administrative  Agent,  as the case may be,  makes  written
demand  therefor.  If a Bank, as the result of any Tax with respect to which the
Borrower is required to make a payment  pursuant to this Section shall realize a
tax credit or refund in its country or other  jurisdiction of  incorporation  or
organization  or in the  jurisdiction  in which its principal  office or Lending
Office or Eurodollar Lending Office is then located,  which tax credit or refund
would not have been  realized but for the  Borrower's  payment of such Tax, such
Bank shall pay to the  Borrower an amount equal to such tax credit or refund (to
the extent of amounts  that have been paid by the  Borrower  under this  Section
with respect to such credit or refund) net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such
Bank; provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Bank, agrees to return
such credit or refund (plus  penalties,  interest or other charges) to such Bank
in the  event  such  Bank is  required  to repay  such  credit  or refund to the
relevant taxing authority. Any amount required to be calculated pursuant to this
Section  shall be calculated  in good faith by the Bank (or  Transferee)  or the
Administrative  Agent, and such calculation shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties hereto.

(d) Without  prejudice to the survival of any other  agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section shall
survive Termination,  provided that Borrower shall have no further obligation to
the Banks under this Section  unless a  certificate  setting forth the amount of
such  obligation  shall have been delivered by the Banks to the Borrower  within
ninety (90) calendar days after the Termination Date.

(e) Each Bank (or  Transferee)  that is organized  outside the
United States (i) on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement and
(ii) with respect to each Lending  Office or Eurodollar  Lending  Office located
outside the United  States of such Bank (or  Transferee),  on or before the date
such office or branch  becomes a Lending  Office or Eurodollar  Lending  Office,
shall deliver to the Borrower and the  Administrative  Agent such  certificates,
documents  or other  evidence,  as required by the Code or Treasury  Regulations
issued pursuant  thereto,  including  Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or Form
4224,  properly  completed  and  duly  executed  by such  Bank  (or  Transferee)
establishing that payments received hereunder are (i) not subject to withholding
under the Code because such payment is effectively connected with the conduct by
such Bank (or
<PAGE>
Transferee)  of a trade or business in the United States or (ii) totally  exempt
from United States  Federal  withholding  tax under a provision of an applicable
tax treaty. In addition,  each such Bank (or Transferee)  shall, if legally able
to do so, thereafter deliver such certificates, documents or other evidence from
time to time establishing  that payments  received  hereunder are not subject to
such withholding upon receipt of a written request therefor from the Borrower or
the Administrative  Agent. Unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent have
received forms or other documents  satisfactory to them indicating that payments
hereunder  or  under  the  Notes  are  not  subject  to  United  States  Federal
withholding  tax, the Borrower or the  Administrative  Agent shall withhold such
taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate.

(f) The Borrower  shall not be required to pay any  additional
amounts to any Bank (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent in respect to
United  States  Federal  withholding  tax pursuant to paragraph (a) above if the
obligation  to pay such  additional  amounts  would  not have  arisen  but for a
failure by such Bank (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent to deliver the
certificates,  documents or other evidence specified in the preceding  paragraph
(e) unless  such  failure is  attributable  to (i) a change in  applicable  law,
regulation  or  official   interpretation   thereof  or  (ii)  an  amendment  or
modification  to or a  revocation  of any  applicable  tax treaty or a change in
official position regarding the application or interpretation  thereof,  in each
case on or after the date such Bank (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent
becomes a party to this  Agreement  (or, if  applicable,  on or after the date a
Lending  Office or Eurodollar  Lending  Office of such Bank (or  Transferee)  or
Administrative  Agent  became a Lending  Office  or  Eurodollar  Lending  Office
hereunder).

(g) Nothing  contained in this Section  shall require any Bank
(or  Transferee)  or the  Administrative  Agent to make available any of its tax
returns (or any other  information  relating to its taxes)  which it deems to be
confidential.

(h) Each  Bank or the  Administrative  Agent on  behalf of the
Banks shall give  notification to the Borrower of any event or prospective event
which will give rise to the  operation  of  paragraphs  (a),  (b) or (c) of this
Section, such notification to be sent within thirty (30) days of the date of the
public promulgation of the effective date of any such Taxes or Stamp Taxes.

SECTION 2.20  Termination or Assignment of Commitments Under Certain
Circumstances.

(a) If any Bank (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent
claims any additional  amounts payable  pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section 2.19
or exercises its rights under Section 2.14, it shall  (consistent with legal and
regulatory   restrictions)   (i)  promptly  notify  the  Borrower  (through  the
Administrative  Agent)  of the  circumstances  giving  rise to  such  additional
amounts or the exercise of such rights and (ii) file any certificate or document
requested by the Borrower or change the  jurisdiction of its applicable  Lending
Office or take any other  action if the making of such a filing or change or the
taking of such action  would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such
additional amounts which may thereafter accrue or avoid the circumstances giving
rise to such exercise and would not, in the sole  determination of such Bank (or
Transferee), be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank (or Transferee).
<PAGE>
(b) In the event that any Bank shall have  delivered  a notice
or  certificate  pursuant  to Section  2.13 or 2.14,  or the  Borrower  shall be
required  to make  additional  payments  to any Bank  under  Section  2.19,  the
Borrower  shall have the right,  at its option and own  expense,  upon notice to
such Bank and the  Administrative  Agent, (i) in the case of Sections 2.13, 2.14
or 2.19 only,  to  terminate  the  Commitment  of such Bank or (ii) in all cases
described in this paragraph, to require such Bank to transfer and assign without
recourse  (in  accordance  with and  subject to the  restrictions  contained  in
Section 9.4) all its interests,  rights and obligations  under this Agreement to
another financial institution  reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent
which shall assume such  obligations;  provided that (i) no such  termination or
assignment  shall  conflict  with any law,  rule or  regulation  or order of any
Governmental  Authority and (ii) the Borrower or the  assignee,  as the case may
be, shall pay to the affected Bank in immediately available funds on the date of
such termination or assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date
of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all other  amounts  accrued for
its  account  or owed to it  hereunder,  including  without  limitation  amounts
payable and owed to it pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.19, if any.

(c) Each Bank  represents and warrants to the Borrower that as
of the date hereof it is not aware of any claims  available to it under  Section
2.13, 2.14 or 2.19 or any  circumstances  which it has determined will enable it
to make any such claims.

ARTICLE IIA

LETTERS OF CREDIT

SECTION 2A.1 Standby Letters of Credit.

(a) Provided that the Borrower has  satisfied  the  conditions
precedent  contained in Section  2A.1(b) hereof,  the Issuing Bank agrees,  from
time to time,  to issue and/or renew Letters of Credit on behalf of the Borrower
so long as (i) upon such  issuance or renewal,  an issuance  fee (the "Letter of
Credit  Fee") is paid by Borrower to the Issuing  Bank in an amount equal to the
Applicable Margin as to the Letter of Credit Fee times the amount of each Letter
of Credit, and (ii) the outstanding aggregate principal amount of all Borrowings
made by all Banks  pursuant to their  Revolving  Credit Loan,  together with the
Letter of Credit Balance, after giving effect to such Letter of Credit, will not
exceed the Maximum Commitment.

(b) The  obligation  of the Issuing Bank to issue and/or renew
any  Letters  of  Credit  on  behalf of the  Borrower  shall be  subject  to the
following  conditions  precedent on the date of issuance or renewal of each such
Letter of Credit:

(i) The  Borrower  shall  execute  and deliver to the
Issuing Bank an application for letter of credit, specifying the amount
of the requested  letter of credit,  the requested term thereof,  which
term may not exceed one year, and the beneficiary thereof; and

(ii) No Event of Default  shall exist and no event or
condition shall exist that after notice or lapse of time, or both would
constitute an Event of Default.

SECTION  2A.2 Notice.  The Issuing  Bank shall give the  Administrative
Agent,  which shall in turn give to each Bank, prompt written or telecopy advice
of any notice received from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph.

SECTION 2A.3 Letter of Credit Participations.

(a) By the  issuance  of a Letter of Credit  and  without  any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Banks in respect  thereof,
the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Bank, and each Bank hereby  acquires from
the Issuing Bank, a participation  in such Letter of Credit equal to such Bank's
Commitment  percentage,  based upon the Commitments in effect at the time of any
drawing  thereunder (or, if the Commitments shall have been terminated  pursuant
to  Article  VII,  the   Commitments  in  effect   immediately   prior  to  such
termination),  of the face amount of such Letter of Credit,  effective  upon the
issuance  of such  Letter of Credit;  provided,  however,  that no Bank shall be
required to acquire participations in Letters of Credit that would result in its
pro rata percentage,  based upon its Commitment, of the Letter of Credit Balance
exceeding its Commitment.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing,
each  Bank  hereby  absolutely  and   unconditionally   agrees  to  pay  to  the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, in accordance with
<PAGE>
Section 2A.4 below, such Bank's pro rata percentage of each unreimbursed  Letter
of Credit Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank.

(b) Each Bank  acknowledges and agrees that its acquisition of
participations  pursuant to paragraph  (a) above in respect of Letters of Credit
is absolute  and  unconditional  and shall not be  affected by any  circumstance
whatsoever,  including without  limitation the occurrence and continuance of any
Event of Default hereunder, and that each such payment shall be made without any
offset,  abatement,  withholding or reduction whatsoever;  provided that nothing
herein shall  constitute a waiver of any rights a Bank may have by reason of the
gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Issuing Bank.

SECTION 2A.4 Disbursement and Reimbursement.

(a) Promptly  after it shall have  ascertained  that any draft
and any accompanying  documents  presented under a Letter of Credit appear to be
in strict conformity with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, the
Issuing  Bank  shall  give  telephone  and  telecopy   notice  to  the  Borrower
(separately to Mr. Riley and to Mr. Lyding) and the Administrative  Agent of the
receipt and amount of such draft and the date on which  payment  thereon will be
made. If the Administrative  Agent shall not have received from the Borrower the
payment  required  pursuant to paragraph (b) below by 10:00 a.m.,  Arizona time,
one Business Day after the date on which payment of a draft  presented under any
Letter of Credit has been made,  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  so
notify the  Issuing  Bank and each Bank,  specifying  in the notice to each Bank
such Bank's pro rata percentage,  based upon the Commitments,  of such Letter of
Credit Disbursement.  Each Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent, not later
than 1:00 p.m.,  Arizona  time,  on such date,  such Bank's  percentage  of such
Letter of Credit Disbursement, which the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay
to the Issuing Bank. The  Administrative  Agent will promptly remit to each Bank
such   Bank's   percentage   of  any  amounts   subsequently   received  by  the
Administrative  Agent from the  Borrower  in  respect  of such  Letter of Credit
Disbursement;  provided that (i) amounts so received for the account of any Bank
prior to payment by such Bank of amounts  required to be paid by it hereunder in
respect  of any  Letter of Credit  Disbursement  and (ii)  amounts  representing
interest  on any  Letter  of Credit  Disbursement  for the  period  prior to the
payment  by such  Bank of such  amounts  shall in each case be  remitted  to the
Issuing Bank.

(b) If the Issuing Bank shall pay any draft  presented under a
Letter  of  Credit,  the  Borrower  shall  pay to  the  Issuing  Bank  or to the
administrative   Agent  for  the  account  of  the  Issuing   Bank  or,  if  the
Administrative  Agent shall have received the payments provided in paragraph (a)
above with respect to such  drawing,  for the  accounts of the Banks,  an amount
equal to the  amount of such draft  before  10:00  a.m.,  Arizona  time,  on the
Business Day immediately  following the date of payment of such draft,  together
with  interest on such amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest  rate in
effect for Base Rate Borrowings from (and including) the date of payment of such
draft  to (but  excluding)  the  date  of  such  payment  by the  Borrower.  The
obligation  of the  Borrower  to pay  the  amounts  referred  to  above  in this
paragraph  (b) shall be absolute,  unconditional  and  irrevocable  and shall be
satisfied strictly in accordance with their terms irrespective of:
<PAGE>
(i) any lack of  validity  or  enforceability  of any
Letter of Credit;

(ii) the existence of any claim,  setoff,  defense or
other right which the Borrower or any other Person may at any time have
against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit,  the Administrative
Agent,  any Issuing Bank or any Bank (other than the defense of payment
in  accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement or a defense based on
the gross  negligence or wilful  misconduct of the Issuing Bank) or any
other  Person  in   connection   with  this   Agreement  or  any  other
transaction;

(iii) any draft or other document  presented  under a
Letter of Credit  proving  to be forged,  fraudulent  or invalid in any
respect or any  statement  therein  being untrue or  inaccurate  in any
respect; provided that payment by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of
Credit  against  presentation  of such draft or document shall not have
constituted gross negligence or wilful misconduct;

(iv)  payment by the  Issuing  Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document which does not
comply  in any  immaterial  respect  with the  terms of such  Letter of
Credit;  provided  that such payment shall not have  constituted  gross
negligence or wilful misconduct; or

(v)  any  other  circumstance  or  event  whatsoever,
whether or not  similar  to any of the  foregoing;  provided  that such
other  circumstance  or event  shall not have been the  result of gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Issuing Bank.

It is understood  that in making any payment under a Letter of
Credit (1) the Issuing Bank's exclusive  reliance on the documents  presented to
it under  such  Letter of Credit as to any and all  matters  set forth  therein,
including  without  limitation,  reliance  on the amount of any draft  presented
under such  Letter of Credit,  whether or not the amount due to the  beneficiary
equals  the  amount of such  draft and  whether  or not any  document  presented
pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged,  fraudulent or invalid in
any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or
not any other statement or any other document  presented pursuant to such Letter
of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement  therein  proves to be
inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever, and (2) any noncompliance in any
immaterial respect of the documents  presented under a Letter of Credit with the
terms thereof shall,  in either case,  not be deemed wilful  misconduct or gross
negligence of the Issuing Bank.

ARTICLE VIII

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

SECTION  8.1  Appointment.   In  order  to  expedite  the  transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement,  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is hereby  appointed to
act as Administrative  Agent on behalf of the Banks. Each of the Banks, and each
subsequent  holder of any Note by its  acceptance  thereof,  hereby  irrevocably
authorizes  the  Administrative  Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to
exercise such powers as are specifically  delegated to the Administrative  Agent
by the terms and  provisions  hereof and of the other Loan  Documents,  together
with  such  actions  and  powers  as  are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  The
Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Banks, without hereby
limiting  any  implied  authority,  (a) to  receive  on  behalf of the Banks all
payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other  amounts due to
the Banks hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Bank its proper share of
each payment so  received;  (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Banks to
the Borrower of any Default or Event of Default  specified in this  Agreement of
which the Administrative  Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with
its agency hereunder;  and (c) to distribute to each Bank copies of all notices,
financial  statements and other materials  delivered by the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement as received by the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.2 Liability.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
directors,  officers, employees or agents shall be liable as such for any action
taken or omitted by any of them  except for its or his own gross  negligence  or
wilful   misconduct,   or  be  responsible   for  any  statement,   warranty  or
representation  herein or the contents of any document  delivered in  connection
herewith,  or be required to  ascertain  or to make any inquiry  concerning  the
performance  or  observance  by the  Borrower  of any of the terms,  conditions,
covenants or agreements contained in any Loan Document. The Administrative Agent
shall not be  responsible  to the Banks or the  holders of the Notes for the due
execution,  genuineness,  validity,  enforceability  or  effectiveness  of  this
Agreement,  the  Notes or any  other  Loan  Documents  or other  instruments  or
agreements. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as
the owner thereof for all purposes  hereof until it shall have received from the
payee of such Note notice,  given as provided herein,  of the transfer  thereof.
The  Administrative  Agent shall in all cases be fully  protected in acting,  or
refraining from acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by either
the Required Banks (if the consent of only the Required Banks is required by the
provisions of this  Agreement with respect to an issue) or all the Banks (if the
consent of all the Banks is required by the  provisions of this  Agreement  with
respect to an issue),  as  applicable,  and,  except as  otherwise  specifically
provided herein,  such  instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto
shall be binding on all the Banks and each  subsequent  holder of any Note.  The
Administrative  Agent shall,  in the absence of knowledge  to the  contrary,  be
entitled to rely on any  instrument or document  believed by it in good faith to
be genuine and  correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper  Person or
Persons.  Neither the Administrative  Agent nor any of its directors,  officers,
employees or agents shall have any  responsibility to the Borrower on account of
the  failure  of or delay in  performance  or  breach  by any Bank of any of its
obligations  hereunder  or to any Bank on account of the  failure of or delay in
performance  or  breach  by any  other  Bank  or the  Borrower  of any of  their
respective obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or
<PAGE>
in connection  herewith or therewith.  The Administrative  Agent may execute any
and all duties hereunder by or through agents or employees and shall be entitled
to rely upon the  advice of legal  counsel  selected  by it with  respect to all
matters  arising  hereunder  and  shall not be liable  for any  action  taken or
suffered in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel.

SECTION 8.3 Action by Administrative Agent.

(a) The Banks hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent
shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by
it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement  unless it shall be requested in
writing to do so by the Required Banks.

(b) Except as hereinafter  provided,  the Administrative Agent
may, with the consent of the Required Banks, (i) agree to the modification of or
waiver of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents,  or (ii) consent to any
act or  omission  by the  Borrower,  or (iii)  exercise  any  rights  which  the
Administrative Agent may have with respect to the Loans, the Notes or any of the
other Loan  Documents.  Unless in each case  consented  to in writing by all the
Banks,  the  Administrative  Agent,   however,   shall  not  (i)  agree  to  the
modification or waiver of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents, or (ii)
consent to any act or omission by the  Borrower,  or (iii)  exercise  any rights
which the Administrative Agent may have with respect to the Loans, the Notes, or
any of the other Loan Documents,  if any such agreement,  modification,  waiver,
consent or exercise would:

(i) change or modify the interest  rate and repayment
provisions set forth in the Loan Documents;

(ii) increase the Maximum Commitment;

(iii) extend the Maturity Date;

(iv)  postpone  any date for  payment or forgive  the
payment of  principal  of, or interest  on, the Loans or the payment of
any other sum due under the Loan Documents;

(v) change or modify the Fees,  other than the Agency
Fee, or the payment of such Fees;

(vi) release the Guarantor; or

(vii) amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.13,
2.14,  2.16,  2.19,  9.5,  9.6,  9.8(b)  or this  Section  8.3(b),  the
definition of "Required Banks," or Section 6.6 or Section 6.7.

(c) Upon receipt of a Borrowing Notice from the Borrower,  the
Administrative  Agent  shall  provide  to each  Bank a  telecopy  notice of such
Borrowing (or telephone  notice promptly
<PAGE>
confirmed by telecopy) (i) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing, not later than 9:30
a.m.,  Arizona time, three Business Days before a proposed LIBOR Borrowing,  and
(b) in the case of a Base Rate  Borrowing,  not later  than 9:30  a.m.,  Arizona
time, on the Business Day of a proposed Base Rate Borrowing.

(d) The Administrative Agent agrees to distribute to each Bank
by 4:00 p.m.,  Arizona time, its pro rata share of each payment or prepayment of
principal of any Loan,  each payment of interest on the Loans,  and each payment
of the  Commitment Fee and Facility Fee that is received from the Borrower prior
to 12:00  noon,  Arizona  time.  Any such  payments  received  after 12:00 noon,
Arizona  time,  on any Business  Day shall be made  available to the Banks on or
before 4:00 p.m., Arizona time, on the immediately following Business Day.

(e) The Administrative  Agent agrees to distribute promptly to
each  Bank  a copy  of all  Information  received  from  the  Borrower  and  all
amendments and modifications of the Loan Documents.

(f) The Administrative  Agent agrees to distribute or cause to
be  distributed  no later than thirty  (30) days after the Closing  Date to each
Bank a copy of the Loan Documents.

SECTION 8.4 Resignation.  The Administrative Agent may not, without the
consent of the Borrower,  resign at any time.  Upon receiving such consent,  and
subject to giving 30 days' prior written notice to the Banks, the Administrative
Agent may resign as Administrative  Agent hereunder.  Upon any such resignation,
the Required Banks, with the consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld),  shall  have the  right  to  appoint  from the  Banks a
successor.  If no successor  shall have been so appointed by the Required  Banks
and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the Administrative
Agent gives notice of its  resignation,  then the  Administrative  Agent may, on
behalf of the Banks,  appoint a successor  Administrative Agent which shall be a
bank with an office in Phoenix,  Arizona,  having a combined capital and surplus
of at least $50,000,000.00 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance
of any appointment as  Administrative  Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such
successor  shall  succeed  to and become  vested  with all the  rights,  powers,
privileges  and duties of the retiring  Administrative  Agent and such  retiring
Administrative  Agent  shall be  discharged  from  its  duties  and  obligations
hereunder.   After  the  Administrative  Agent's  resignation   hereunder,   the
provisions  of this  Article and  Section  9.5 shall  continue in effect for its
benefit in respect  of any  actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as an Administrative Agent.

SECTION  8.5  Agent as  Bank.  With  respect  to the  Loans  made by it
hereunder and the Notes issued to it, the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity  and not as an  Administrative  Agent  shall  have the same  rights and
powers as any  other  Bank and may  exercise  the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from,  lend money to and generally  engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate  thereof as if it were not the
Administrative Agent.
<PAGE>
SECTION 8.6 Ownership and Possession of Loan Documents. Each Bank shall
own an undivided  interest in the Borrowings and the Loan Documents equal to its
pro rata Commitment from time to time. The  Administrative  Agent shall hold the
Loan  Documents  in its  possession,  as  agent,  at  its  office  at  100  West
Washington,   Phoenix,   Arizona  85003,  or  at  such  other  location  as  the
Administrative  Agent shall designate in writing to the Banks,  for the pro rata
benefit  of itself as one of the  Banks and each of the other  Banks;  provided,
however,  that the  Administrative  Agent shall deliver to each Bank an original
promissory note executed by the Borrower and evidencing such Bank's  Commitment.
The Administrative Agent shall keep and maintain complete and accurate files and
records of all matters  pertaining  to the  Borrowings.  Upon  reasonable  prior
notice to the  Administrative  Agent by a Bank,  the files and records  shall be
made  available to such Bank and its respective  representatives  and agents for
inspection and copying during normal business hours.

SECTION  8.7  Indemnification.  Each Bank agrees (i) to  reimburse  the
Administrative  Agent, on demand,  in the amount of its pro rata share (based on
its Commitment  hereunder) of any expenses incurred for the benefit of the Banks
by the Administrative  Agent,  including counsel fees and compensation of agents
and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Banks, which shall not
have been reimbursed by the Borrower and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, on
demand,  in the  amount of such pro rata  share,  from and  against  any and all
liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits,  costs,  expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on,  incurred by or  asserted  against it in its  capacity as the
Administrative  Agent or any of them in any way  relating  to or arising  out of
this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document or any action taken or omitted by it
or any of them under this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  to the extent
the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower; provided that no Person
shall be liable to the Administrative Agent for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations,  losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits, costs,
expenses  or  disbursements  resulting  from  the  gross  negligence  or  wilful
misconduct  of the  Administrative  Agent  or any  of its  directors,  officers,
employees or agents.

SECTION 8.8 Independent Credit Analysis. Each Bank acknowledges that it
has,  independently  and without reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent or any
other  Bank  and  based  on such  documents  and  information  as it has  deemed
appropriate,  made its own  credit  analysis  and  decision  to enter  into this
Agreement.  Each Bank also acknowledges that it will,  independently and without
reliance  upon the  Administrative  Agent or any  other  Bank and  based on such
documents  and  information  as it shall  from  time to time  deem  appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  any related  agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

SECTION 8.9 Process for Obtaining Approval of the Banks.

(a) With  respect  to  obtaining  the  consent,  approval,  or
determination of all of the Banks or of the Required Banks,  the  Administrative
Agent or any Bank may request  that the Banks make a  determination  pursuant to
this Agreement.  In the case of a request by any such Bank, the request shall be
made through the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall request
<PAGE>
a  determination  of  the  Banks  in  accordance  with  this  Section  8.9.  All
communications from the Administrative  Agent to the Banks requesting the Banks'
determination, consent, approval, disapproval and/or joinder shall:

(i) Be given in the form of a written  notice to each
of the Banks;

(ii) Be accompanied by a description of the matter or
thing as to which such determination, approval, consent, disapproval or
joinder is  requested,  and shall  advise  each of the Banks where such
matter  or  thing  may be  inspected,  or  shall  otherwise  adequately
describe the matter or issue to be resolved;

(iii) Include,  to the extent not previously provided
to the Banks, all written materials (to the extent necessary to make an
informed  decision) and a description of all oral  information  (to the
extent  necessary  to  make  an  informed  decision)  provided  to  the
Administrative  Agent in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved;
and

(iv)    Include    such   other    information    and
recommendations  as  the  Administrative   Agent  may  reasonably  deem
appropriate.

(b) Subject to  Paragraph  (c) of this  Section 8.9, the Banks
shall reply within seven (7) calendar days after such written notice is given by
the Administrative  Agent;  provided,  however, that if the Administrative Agent
notifies the Banks that, pursuant to the Loan Documents, the matter with respect
to which such consent, approval,  disapproval or joinder is sought requires that
the  Administrative  Agent respond within a certain time period and/or  provides
that if a response is not given  within a certain  time period such  approval or
consent shall be deemed  given,  the Banks shall reply by the earlier of (i) two
(2)  Business  Days  before  such time  period  expires  (as  designated  by the
Administrative  Agent) or (ii) three (3) Business Days after such written notice
is given by the Administrative Agent.

(c)  With  respect  to each  Bank,  unless a Bank  shall  give
written  notice to the  Administrative  Agent that such Bank does  consent to or
approve any matter as to which such Bank's  consent or approval is sought within
the applicable time frame,  such Bank shall be deemed to have disapproved of and
not consented to such recommendation or determination.

SECTION 8.10  Communications to the Banks. All communications  from the
Borrower to the Banks relating to the Loan Documents and the Borrowings shall be
sent by or through the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.11 Relationship with the Borrower. Consistent with the agency
established  hereunder,  the Banks acknowledge and agree that the Administrative
Agent,  in  accordance  with its  respective  rights and  duties  under the Loan
Documents,   shall  have  the  sole  and   exclusive   authority   to  bind  the
Administrative  Agent and the Banks with respect to matters relating to the Loan
Documents.  To the extent that any matter has been  approved by all of the Banks
or by the Required
<PAGE>
Banks in accordance  with the provisions of this Agreement,  the  Administrative
Agent  is  authorized  to  execute  such   documents  and   instruments  as  the
Administrative Agent may deem prudent to evidence and confirm such approval.

SECTION 8.12  Payments to or by the Banks.

(a) The Banks  shall be  entitled to interest on the amount of
Borrowings  held by each  Bank  for the  period  of  time  such  Borrowings  are
outstanding  at the rates set forth in this  Agreement,  to the extent that such
payments are  actually  received  from the  Borrower.  If permitted  pursuant to
Section 2.9 of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall charge and collect
interest at the Default Rate unless the Required Banks otherwise agree.

(b) Other Fees to the extent  applicable  shall be paid to the
Banks in accordance with Section 2.6.

(c) Amounts paid by the Borrower  pursuant to any provision of
the Loan Documents providing for payment,  compensation, or reimbursement to one
or more,  but not  necessarily  all, of the Banks,  shall be paid to the Bank or
Banks incurring such expenses or otherwise entitled to compensation under any of
those provisions, with each Bank entitled to receive any payment, reimbursement,
or  compensation  pursuant  to any of such  Sections or other  provisions  being
obligated to provide to the Administrative  Agent and the Borrower a certificate
setting forth in  reasonable  detail the basis for the amount of any request for
compensation,  payment or  reimbursement  under any of those  Sections  or other
provisions.

(d)  Regular  monthly  payments  of  interest  and  any  other
payments to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Banks (other than payments
to be applied to the outstanding principal amount of Borrowings,  which payments
will be applied as provided  in Section  8.13),  received by the  Administrative
Agent shall be made available to the Banks entitled  thereto in accordance  with
Section 8.3(d).

(e) If and to the  extent  any Bank  shall  not have  made any
payment  required  pursuant  to  Section  2.4,  such  Bank  agrees  to  pay  the
Administrative Agent,  forthwith on demand, such amount,  together with interest
thereon at the Federal  Funds  Rate,  for each day from such date until the date
such amount is paid to the  Administrative  Agent as provided in Section 2.4(c).
The failure of any Bank to make available to the Administrative Agent any amount
required  pursuant  to  Section  2.4 shall  not  relieve  any other  Bank of its
obligation  hereunder to make available as aforesaid such payment,  as specified
above,  nor shall any Bank be relieved of its  obligations to make such payments
for any other reason.

(f) Funds shall be transferred to the Banks in accordance with
the funds transfer  instructions  given to the  Administrative  Agent and by the
Administrative  Agent to the  Banks  from  time to time on or  before  the times
specified in Section 8.3(d).
<PAGE>
(g) If and to the extent the  Administrative  Agent  shall not
have made any  payment  required  pursuant  to  Section  8.3(d)  to a Bank,  the
Administrative  Agent agrees to pay such Bank forthwith on demand,  such amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate, for each day from such
date until the date such amount is paid pursuant to Section 8.3(d).

SECTION 8.13 Application of Payments.  All monies collected or received
by the  Administrative  Agent on account of the Loans or in respect of  security
for the Loans,  directly or indirectly,  shall be applied in the following order
of  priority,  except to the  extent  otherwise  required  by Article II of this
Agreement, in which case the provisions of Article II shall control:

(a) To  the  payment  of all  costs  and  expenses  due to the
Administrative Agent and/or the Banks pursuant to the Loan Documents,  including
costs incurred in collection of such monies, including,  without limitation, the
payment to the Banks of the amounts described in Section 8.12(d);

(b) To outstanding  interest on the Loans,  which amount shall
be allocated between the Banks in accordance with the actual principal amount of
Loans held by each Bank  throughout  the period in question as determined by the
Administrative  Agent  on a daily  basis;  provided,  however,  that if  amounts
received by the Administrative  Agent are not sufficient to pay in full all such
outstanding  interest on the Loans,  such amount  shall be  allocated  among the
Banks pro rata in  accordance  with the amount of Loans held by each Bank during
the period in question; and

(c) To the  payment of  principal  on the Loans in  accordance
with the principal amount of Loans held by each Bank.

SECTION 8.14  Defaulting Banks.

(a) If for any reason any of the Banks shall fail or refuse to
abide by its obligations  under the Loan Documents  (each a "Defaulting  Bank"),
then,  in  addition  to the rights and  remedies  that may be  available  to the
Administrative  Agent and the other  Banks at law and in equity,  but subject to
the notice and cure periods  hereinafter set forth, such Defaulting Bank's right
to  participate  in the  administration  of the  Loans  and the Loan  Documents,
including without  limitation,  any rights to consent to or direct any action or
inaction  of the  Administrative  Agent,  all of the Banks,  or to be taken into
account in the  calculation  of the Required Banks (other than the right to vote
with respect to a decision as to its Loans to extend the Maturity  Date thereof,
or to amend the interest rate and repayment provisions thereof or to modify such
Bank's  Commitment),  shall be suspended  during the pendency of such failure or
refusal.  A Bank shall be deemed to be a Defaulting  Bank if (i) such Bank shall
have failed to pay to the  Administrative  Agent any amount due pursuant to this
Agreement   within  five  (5)  Business  Days  after   written   notice  by  the
Administrative  Agent to such Bank stating such payment is due from such Bank to
the Administrative Agent; (ii) such Bank shall have failed to perform any of its
other  obligations  under this  Agreement or the Loan  Documents in any material
respect. and such failure shall not have been cured within 30 days after written
notice  by the  Administrative  Agent to such Bank of such  failure,  or if such
failure cannot reasonably be cured within such 30 day period, within such longer
period of time as may be necessary to complete such
<PAGE>
cure,  so long as such Bank  commences  such cure within such 30-day  period and
thereafter  diligently  pursues such cure to completion within not more than 120
days after such written notice; or (iii) such Bank shall institute or be subject
to any bankruptcy, insolvency,  receivership,  conservatorship,  reorganization,
liquidation  or  similar  proceedings  under  state or  federal  law;  provided,
however, in the case of a failure described in clause (i) or clause (ii) of this
sentence,  if within the 5-Business Day period described in clause (i) or the 30
day period described in clause (ii), as applicable, the Bank in question in good
faith  disputes such default  asserting  that such default has not occurred (and
provided that such Bank has satisfied  its funding  obligations  pursuant to the
provisions  of Section  2.4),  such Bank shall not be deemed to be a  Defaulting
Bank until such Bank is found to be in default  pursuant to a final  judicial or
arbitration  determination  and such Bank does not  thereafter  take the  action
necessary to cure the default  within 10 Business Days following the date of the
final determination.

(b) With  respect to each  Defaulting  Bank,  any Current Bank
shall,  in addition to any other rights or remedies  available at law or equity,
be entitled, in the case of the failure of a Defaulting Bank to pay its pro rata
share (the "Defaulting Bank's Share") in a Loan made pursuant to Section 2.4, to
pay to the Administrative Agent the Defaulting Bank's Share (pro rata if made by
more than one Current  Bank,  based on the pro rata shares of the Current  Banks
making the  payment).  If one or more of the Current  Banks pays the  Defaulting
Banks'  Share,  in addition to any other  rights and  remedies  available to the
Banks,  each  Current  Bank  making  such  payment may elect to do either of the
following with respect to the payment made by such Current Bank:

(i) Notify the Administrative Agent to adjust the pro
rata shares of the Defaulting  Bank and the Current Bank making payment
of the Defaulting Bank's Share,  allocating the Defaulting Bank's Share
to the Current Bank as of the date the Loan was made; or

(ii) Receive all amounts  which the  Defaulting  Bank
would otherwise be entitled to receive  pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to the Defaulting  Bank's Share  (including  interest  accruing
under the Loan  Documents on the Loan, to the extent of the  Defaulting
Bank's  Share of such Loan),  pro rata  according to the portion of the
Defaulting  Bank's Share paid by such Current Bank,  until such Current
Bank has been repaid the full amount of the  Defaulting  Bank's  Share,
together with accrued interest paid by the Borrower under the Agreement
with respect thereto.

SECTION 8.15 Purchase of Defaulting Bank's Interest After Default. If a
Bank  becomes a Defaulting  Bank under  Section  8.14,  each Bank which is not a
Defaulting Bank (a "Current Bank") shall have the right, but not the obligation,
in its sole  discretion  to acquire (or if more than one Current Bank  exercises
such right,  each such  Current  Bank shall have the right to acquire,  pro rata
according  to its pro rata  shares,  or in such  other  proportions  as they may
mutually  agree),  the interest in the  Commitment and the Loans of a Defaulting
Bank. Upon any such purchase,  the Defaulting  Bank's interest in the Commitment
and the Loans and its  rights  hereunder  as a Bank  (but not its  liability  in
respect  thereof  or under  the Loan  Documents  or this  Agreement  for  events
occurring prior to such purchase)  shall terminate at the date of purchase,  and
the Defaulting Bank shall promptly

SECTION 9.4 Successors and Assigns.

(a) Whenever in this  Agreement  any of the parties  hereto is
referred  to,  such  reference  shall be deemed to include  the  successors  and
assigns of such party;  and all  covenants,  promises  and  agreements  by or on

successors and assigns.

(b) Each  Bank at its own  expense  may  assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its interests,  rights and obligations  under this
Agreement  (including all or a portion of its  Commitment,  and the Loans at the
time owing to it and the Notes held by it); provided,  however,  that (i) except
in the  case  of an  assignment  to a Bank  or an  Affiliate  of any  Bank,  the
Administrative  Agent and, so long as there is no Event of Default  outstanding,
the Borrower must give their prior  written  consent to such  assignment  (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  (ii) each such assignment shall be
of a constant, and not a varying,  percentage of all the assigning Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement,  (iii) except in the case of an assignment
to a Bank or an  Affiliate  of any Bank,  the  amount of the  Commitment  of the
assigning  Bank subject to each such  assignment  (determined as of the date the
Assignment  and Acceptance  with respect to such  assignment is delivered to the
Administrative  Agent)  shall not be less  than  $10,000,000.00  or such  lesser
amount if such amount is the entire  Commitment of the assigning  Bank, (iv) the
parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the  Administrative
Agent an Assignment and  Acceptance,  together with the Note or Notes subject to
such  assignment  and,  except  in the  case  of an  assignment  to a Bank or an

if it  shall  not be a  Bank,  shall  deliver  to the  Administrative  Agent  an
Administrative  Details Reply Form and (vi) any increased costs by reason of any
such assignment will not be borne by the Borrower. Upon acceptance and recording
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 9.4, from and after the effective date
specified in each  Assignment and  Acceptance,  which effective date shall be at
least  five  Business  Days  after  the  execution  thereof,  (A)  the  assignee
thereunder  shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest  assigned
by such Assignment and Acceptance, have all the rights and obligations of a Bank
under this Agreement and (B) the assigning Bank thereunder  shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (and,  in the  case  of an  Assignment  and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Bank's rights
<PAGE>
and obligations under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto
(but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13,  2.15, 2.19
and 9.5, as well as to any Fees  accrued for its account  hereunder  and not yet
paid)).

(c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and  Acceptance,
the assigning  Bank  thereunder and the assignee  thereunder  shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:
(i) such assigning  Bank warrants that it is the legal and  beneficial  owner of
the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that
its Commitment and the outstanding  balances of its Loans, without giving effect
to assignments thereof which have not become effective, are as set forth in such
Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) except as set forth in (i) above, such assigning
Bank makes no  representation  or warranty  and assumes no  responsibility  with
respect  to  any  statements,  warranties  or  representations  made  in  or  in
connection  with  this  Agreement,   or  the  execution,   legality,   validity,
enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any other instrument or document  furnished  pursuant hereto or
the financial  condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or
observance  by the Borrower or any  Subsidiary of any of its  obligations  under
this  Agreement,  any other Loan  Document or any other  instrument  or document
furnished pursuant hereto;  (iii) such assignee  represents and warrants that it
is legally  authorized to enter into such Assignment and  Acceptance;  (iv) such
assignee  confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,  together with
copies of the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.4
and such other  documents and  information as it has deemed  appropriate to make
its own  credit  analysis  and  decision  to  enter  into  such  Assignment  and
Acceptance;  (v) such assignee will  independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative  Agent,  such  assigning Bank or any other Bank and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,  continue to
make its own  credit  decisions  in  taking  or not  taking  action  under  this
Agreement;  (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative  Agent
to take such  action as agent on its behalf and to exercise  such  powers  under
this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably  incidental thereto;  and (vii) such
assignee  agrees  that it will  perform in  accordance  with their terms all the
obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by
it as a Bank.

(d) The  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain  at one of its
offices in Phoenix,  Arizona, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to it and a  register  for the  recordation  of the names and  addresses  of the
Banks,  and the Commitment of, and principal  amount of the Loans owing to, each
Bank  pursuant  to the terms  hereof  from time to time  (the  "Register").  The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error and
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose
name  is  recorded  in the  Register  pursuant  to the  terms  hereof  as a Bank
hereunder for all purposes of this  Agreement.  The Register  shall be available
for  inspection  by the Borrower and any Bank, at any  reasonable  time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e)  Upon  its  receipt  of a duly  completed  Assignment  and
Acceptance  executed by an assigning Bank and an assignee together with the Note
or Notes  subject  to such  assignment,  an  Administrative  Details  Reply Form
completed in respect of the assignee  (unless the  assignee  shall
<PAGE>
already be a Bank hereunder),  the processing and recordation fee referred to in
paragraph  (b) above and, if required,  the written  consent of the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent to such assignment,  the Administrative Agent shall (i)
accept such  Assignment and Acceptance,  (ii) record the  information  contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and
the Banks.  Within five Business Days after receipt of notice, the Borrower,  at
its own  expense,  shall  execute and deliver to the  Administrative  Agent,  in
exchange for the surrendered  Note or Notes, a new Note or Notes to the order of
such  assigning Bank in a principal  amount equal to the  applicable  Commitment
retained by it. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the aggregate  principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes; such
new Notes shall be dated the date of the  surrendered  Notes which they  replace
and shall  otherwise be in  substantially  the form of Exhibit C. Canceled Notes
shall be returned to the Borrower.

(f) Each Bank may without  the consent of the  Borrower or the
Administrative  Agent sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
in  all  or a  portion  of its  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement
(including  all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it and the
Notes held by it);  provided,  however,  that (i) such Bank's  obligations under
this  Agreement  shall  remain  unchanged,  (ii) such Bank shall  remain  solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) the participating banks or other entities shall be entitled to the benefit
of the cost protection  provisions  contained in Sections 2.13, 2.15 and 2.19 to
the same extent as if they were Banks (however no  participating  bank or entity
shall be entitled to claim a greater  amount than could have been claimed by the
Bank  from whom the  participation  was  acquired)  and (iv) the  Borrower,  the
Administrative  Agent and the other  Banks  shall  continue  to deal  solely and
directly  with such Bank in connection  with such Bank's rights and  obligations
under this  Agreement,  and such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce the
obligations of the Borrower  relating to the Loans and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement. No entity acquiring a
participation   pursuant  to  this   paragraph  (f)  shall  by  virtue  of  such
participation have any direct voting rights under this Agreement.

(g) Any  Bank or  participant  may,  in  connection  with  any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation  pursuant to
this Section 9.4,  disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed  assignee
or participant any information  relating to the Borrower  furnished to such Bank
by or on behalf of the Borrower;  provided that, prior to any such disclosure of
such  information,  each such assignee or  participant  or proposed  assignee or
participant  shall  execute an agreement  whereby such  assignee or  participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of such information on terms no less
restrictive than those applicable to Banks pursuant to Section 9.17.

(h) Any Bank may at any time  assign all or any portion of its
rights  under this  Agreement  and the Notes  issued to it to a Federal  Reserve
Bank;  provided  that no such  assignment  shall  release a Bank from any of its
obligations hereunder.

(i) The  Borrower  shall  not  assign or  delegate  any of its
rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Banks.
<PAGE>
SECTION 9.5 Expenses; Indemnity.

(a) The  Borrower  agrees  to pay all  out-of-pocket  expenses
reasonably incurred by the Administrative  Agent and any Bank in connection with
the  preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection
with any  amendments,  modifications  or  waivers  of the  provisions  hereof or
thereof  (whether  or  not  the  transactions   hereby   contemplated  shall  be
consummated) or reasonably incurred by the Administrative  Agent and any Bank in
connection with the enforcement or protection of their rights in connection with
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with the Loans made
or the Notes issued hereunder, including without limitation the reasonable fees,
charges and  disbursements of the counsel for the  Administrative  Agent and any
Bank, and, in connection with any such enforcement or protection, the reasonable
fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative  Agent and any
Bank.  The Borrower  further agrees that it shall  indemnify the  Administrative
Agent and any Bank from and hold them harmless  against any  documentary  taxes,
assessments  or  charges  made by any  Governmental  Authority  by reason of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

(b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each  Bank  and  each  of  their  respective  affiliates,  directors,  officers,
employees  and agents (each such person being called an  "Indemnitee")  against,
and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,  damages,
liabilities  and  related  expenses,  including  without  limitation  reasonable
counsel fees,  charges and  disbursements,  incurred by or asserted  against any
Indemnitee  arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the
execution  or  delivery  of this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  or any
agreement or instrument  contemplated  thereby,  the  performance by the parties
thereto of their  respective  obligations  thereunder or the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated  thereby,  (ii) the use of the  proceeds of the Loans
pursuant  to the  request  of the  Borrower  or  (iii)  any  claim,  litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any
Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee,  be  available  to the extent  that such  losses,  claims,  damages,
liabilities  or  related  expenses  are  determined  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

(c) The provisions of this Section shall remain  operative and
in full  force  and  effect  regardless  of the  expiration  of the term of this
Agreement,  the  consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  or any  investigation
made by or on behalf of the  Administrative  Agent and any Bank. All amounts due
under this Section shall be payable on written demand therefor.

SECTION 9.6 Right of Setoff. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.17,
if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing  and any Bank shall
have requested the Administrative Agent to declare the Loans immediately due and
payable pursuant to Article VII, each Bank is hereby  authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent  permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final)
at any time held
<PAGE>
and other  indebtedness  at any time  owing by such Bank to or for the credit or
the  account  of the  Borrower  against  any of and all the  obligations  of the
Borrower  now or  hereafter  existing  under this  Agreement  and any other Loan
Documents held by such Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Bank shall have
made any demand under this  Agreement  or such other Loan  Document and although
such obligations may be unmatured;  provided that such right of setoff shall not
apply  to  amounts  which  may be  held in (i)  trust  accounts  or  (ii)  asset
management  accounts,  including without  limitation  brokerage  accounts,  cash
management  accounts  or other  money  management  or  investment  accounts of a
non-depository  nature with any Bank. The rights of each Bank under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies  (including other rights of setoff)
which such Bank may have.

SECTION 9.7 Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
ARIZONA  APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS  MADE AND TO BE ENFORCED  ENTIRELY  WITHIN THAT
STATE.

SECTION 9.8 Waivers; Amendment.

(a) No failure or delay of a party  hereto in  exercising  any
power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or  partial  exercise  of  any  such  right  or  power,  or any  abandonment  or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,  preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the parties  hereunder  and under the other Loan  Documents  are
cumulative  and are not  exclusive  of any rights or  remedies  which they would
otherwise  have. No waiver of any provision of this  Agreement or any other Loan
Document or consent to any departure by a party  therefrom shall in any event be
effective  unless the same shall be permitted  by Paragraph  (b) of this Section
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the purpose for which given.  No notice or demand on a party in any case
shall entitle that party to any other or further  notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances.

(b) Neither this  Agreement  nor any  provision  hereof may be
waived,  amended or modified  except  pursuant to an agreement or  agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Banks; provided,  however,
that any such  agreement  shall have been  consented  to by all the Banks to the
extent required  pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.3(b);  provided further
that no such  agreement  shall amend,  modify or otherwise  affect the rights or
duties of the  Administrative  Agent hereunder without the prior written consent
of the Administrative  Agent. Each Bank and each holder of a Note shall be bound
by any waiver,  amendment or modification  authorized by this Section regardless
of whether its Note shall have been marked to make  reference  thereto,  and any
consent by any Bank or holder of a Note  pursuant to this Section shall bind any
Person  subsequently  acquiring  a Note from it,  whether or not such Note shall
have been so marked.

SECTION 9.9 Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding  anything herein
or in the Notes to the contrary,  if at any time the  applicable  interest rate,
together  with all  fees  and  charges  which  are  treated  as  interest  under
applicable law (collectively,  the "Charges"),  as provided for herein or in any
other document  executed in connection  herewith,  or otherwise  contracted for,
charged,  received,
<PAGE>
taken or  reserved  by any Bank,  shall  exceed  the  maximum  lawful  rate (the
"Maximum  Rate")  which may be  contracted  for,  charged,  taken,  received  or
reserved by such Bank in accordance  with  applicable  law, the rate of interest
payable under the Notes held by such Bank,  together with all Charges payable to
such Bank,  shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.  Borrower hereby agrees to the
payment of interest with respect to the Loans and Borrowings  under the Loans at
the respective  applicable rates determined pursuant to this Agreement,  in each
case as  increased  by any rate of  interest  resulting  from any charges in the
nature of  interest  paid or payable  in  connection  with the Loans,  the Notes
and/or this Agreement.

SECTION  9.10  Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement  and the other  Loan
Documents  constitute the entire  contract  between the parties  relating to the
subject  matter  hereof.  Any previous  agreement  among any of the parties with
respect to the subject  matter hereof is  superseded  by this  Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.  Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents,
expressed  or  implied,  is  intended  to confer  upon any party  other than the
parties  hereto and thereto any rights,  remedies,  obligations  or  liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

SECTION  9.11  Severability.  In  the  event  any  one or  more  of the
provisions  contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document  should be
held invalid,  illegal or unenforceable in any respect,  the validity,  legality
and  enforceability  of the remaining  provisions  contained  herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor
in  good-faith  negotiations  to replace the invalid,  illegal or  unenforceable
provisions with valid  provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

SECTION 9.12  Counterparts and Signature  Pages.  This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original
but all of which when taken together shall constitute but one contract. Delivery
of an executed  counterpart  of a signature  page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission  shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed  counterpart
of this  Agreement.  All parties hereto  authorize the  Administrative  Agent to
gather and attach manually executed  counterpart  signature pages to counterpart
copies of this Agreement in order to constitute one or more counterparts bearing
evidence of manual execution by all parties.

SECTION 9.13  Headings.  Article and Section  headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement  and are not to  affect  the  construction  of,  or to be  taken  into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

SECTION 9.14  Arbitration.

(a)  Arbitration.  Upon the demand of any party,  any  Dispute
shall be resolved by binding  arbitration  (except as set forth in (e) below) in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  A "Dispute" shall mean any action,
dispute,  claim  or  controversy  of any  kind,  whether  in  contract  or tort,
statutory or common law, legal or equitable,  now existing or hereafter  arising
under  or in  connection  with,  or in any way  pertaining  to,  any of the Loan
Documents,  or any past,  present  or
<PAGE>
future extensions of credit and other activities, transactions or obligations of
any kind related directly or indirectly to any of the Loan Documents,  including
without limitation, any of the foregoing arising in connection with the exercise
of any  self-help,  ancillary  or  other  remedies  pursuant  to any of the Loan
Documents.  Any party  may by  summary  proceedings  bring an action in court to
compel  arbitration  of a  Dispute.  Any party who fails or refuses to submit to
arbitration  following  a lawful  demand by any other party shall bear all costs
and  expenses  incurred by such other  party in  compelling  arbitration  of any
Dispute.

(b)  Governing  Rules.   Arbitration   proceedings   shall  be
administered  by the  American  Arbitration  Association  ("AAA")  or such other
administrator  as the parties shall mutually  agree upon in accordance  with the
AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. All Disputes submitted to arbitration shall be
resolved in accordance  with the Federal  Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United
States Code),  notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of
the Loan Documents.  The arbitration shall be conducted at a location in Arizona
selected  by the AAA or  other  administrator.  If  there  is any  inconsistency
between the terms hereof and any such rules,  the terms and procedures set forth
herein shall control. All statutes of limitation applicable to any Dispute shall
apply to any arbitration proceeding. All discovery activities shall be expressly
limited to matters directly relevant to the Dispute being  arbitrated.  Judgment
upon any award  rendered in any  arbitration  may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction; provided however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
be a waiver by any party that is a bank of the protections  afforded to it under
12 U.S.C. ss. 91 or any similar applicable state law.

(c)   No   Waiver;   Provisional   Remedies,   Self-Help   and
Foreclosure.  No provision hereof shall limit the right of any party to exercise
self-help  remedies such as setoff,  foreclosure  against or sale of any real or
personal property collateral or security,  or to obtain provisional or ancillary
remedies,   including  without  limitation  injunctive  relief,   sequestration,
attachment,  garnishment  or the  appointment  of a  receiver,  from a court  of
competent  jurisdiction  before, after or during the pendency of any arbitration
or other  proceeding.  The exercise of any such remedy shall not waive the right
of any party to compel arbitration hereunder.

(d) Arbitrator Qualifications and Powers; Awards.  Arbitrators
must be active  members of the Arizona State Bar or retired  judges of the state
or federal judiciary of Arizona with expertise in the substantive law applicable
to the subject  matter of the  Dispute.  Arbitrators  are  empowered  to resolve
Disputes  by summary  rulings in  response  to motions  filed prior to the final
arbitration  hearing.  Arbitrators  (i) shall resolve all Disputes in accordance
with the substantive  law of the state of Arizona,  (ii) may grant any remedy or
relief  that a court of the state of  Arizona  could  order or grant  within the
scope hereof and such  ancillary  relief as is necessary to make  effective  any
award,  and (iii) shall have the power to award  recovery of all costs and fees,
to impose sanctions and to take such other actions as they deem necessary to the
same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,  the
Arizona Rules of Civil  Procedure or other  applicable law. Any Dispute in which
the amount in  controversy  is  $5,000,000  or less shall be decided by a single
arbitrator who shall not render an award of greater than  $5,000,000  (including
damages, costs, fees and expenses).  By submission to a single arbitrator,  each
party expressly waives any right or claim to recover more than  $5,000,000.  Any
Dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds
<PAGE>
$5,000,000  shall be decided by a majority vote of a panel of three  arbitrators
one of whom shall have experience representing borrowers; provided however, that
all  three   arbitrators   must  actively   participate   in  all  hearings  and
deliberations.

(e) Judicial  Review.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the
contrary,  in any  arbitration  in  which  the  amount  in  controversy  exceeds
$25,000,000,  the  arbitrators  shall  be  required  to make  specific,  written
findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law.  In  such  arbitrations  (i)  the
arbitrators shall not have the power to make any award which is not supported by
substantial  evidence or which is based on legal error,  (ii) an award shall not
be  binding  upon the  parties  unless the  findings  of fact are  supported  by
substantial  evidence and the  conclusions  of law are not  erroneous  under the
substantive  law of the State of Arizona,  and (iii) the  parties  shall have in
addition to the grounds referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act for vacating,
modifying or correcting an award the right to judicial review of (A) whether the
findings of fact  rendered  by the  arbitrators  are  supported  by  substantial
evidence,  and (B)  whether  the  conclusions  of law are  erroneous  under  the
substantive law of the State of Arizona.  Judgment confirming an award in such a
proceeding  may be entered only if a court  determines the award is supported by
substantial  evidence and not based on legal error under the  substantive law of
the State of Arizona.

(f) Miscellaneous. To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA,
the  arbitrators  and the parties shall take all action required to conclude any
arbitration  proceeding  within 180 days of the filing of the  Dispute  with the
AAA. No arbitrator or other party to any arbitration proceeding may disclose the
existence,  content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by
a party  required in the ordinary  course of its business,  by applicable law or
regulation,  or to the extent  necessary to exercise any judicial  review rights
set forth herein.  If more than one agreement for  arbitration by or between the
parties  potentially  applies  to a  Dispute,  the  arbitration  provision  most
directly  related to the Loan  Documents  or the  subject  matter of the Dispute
shall control. This arbitration  provision shall survive termination,  amendment
or  expiration  of any of the Loan  Documents  or any  relationship  between the
parties.

SECTION 9.15  Jurisdiction.

(a)  Each  of  the  parties  hereto  hereby   irrevocably  and
unconditionally  submits,  for  itself  and its  property,  to the  nonexclusive
jurisdiction  of Arizona  State court or Federal  court of the United  States of
America sitting in Phoenix,  Arizona,  and any appellate court from any thereof,
in any action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
other Loan  Documents,  or for  recognition or enforcement of any judgment,  and
each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably and  unconditionally  agrees that
all  claims  in  respect  of any such  action  or  proceeding  may be heard  and
determined  in such  Arizona  State or, to the extent  permitted by law, in such
Federal  court.  Each of the parties  hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such  action or  proceeding  shall be  conclusive  and may be  enforced in other
jurisdictions  by suit on the judgment or in any other  manner  provided by law.
Nothing in this  Agreement  shall  affect any right that any Bank may  otherwise
have to bring any action or proceeding  relating to this  Agreement or the other
Loan  Documents  against  the  Borrower or its  properties  in the courts of any
jurisdiction.
<PAGE>
(b)  Each  of  the  parties  hereto  hereby   irrevocably  and
unconditionally  waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection  which it may now or hereafter  have to the laying of venue of
any suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the other  Loan  Documents  in any  Arizona  State or Federal  court  sitting in
Phoenix,  Arizona.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest  extent  permitted by law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

SECTION 9.16 Waiver of Jury Trial.  Each party hereto hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any  litigation  directly  or  indirectly  arising out of,
under or in connection  with this Agreement or any of the other Loan  Documents.
Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of  litigation,  seek to enforce the foregoing  waiver and (b)
acknowledges  that it and the other  parties  hereto have been  induced to enter
into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as applicable, by (among other
things) the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section.

SECTION  9.17  Confidentiality.  Each Bank agrees to keep  confidential
(and to cause its officers, directors,  employees, agents and representatives to
keep  confidential)  the Information  (as defined  below),  except that any Bank
shall  be  permitted  to  disclose  Information  (i) to  such  of its  officers,
directors,  employees, agents and representatives (including outside counsel) as
need to know such  Information;  (ii) to the extent  required by applicable laws
and regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, or requested by any
bank regulatory authority (provided that such Bank shall, except for Information
requested by any such bank  regulatory  authority,  promptly notify Borrower (to
the extent practicable and lawful,  notice shall be given to the Borrower before
such disclosure is made so as to permit Borrower to seek a protective  order) of
the  circumstances  and  content  of each  such  disclosure  and  shall  request
confidential  treatment of any  Information so  disclosed);  (iii) to the extent
such  Information  (A) becomes  publicly  available  other than as a result of a
breach  of  this  Agreement,  (B)  becomes  available  to  such  Bank  on a  non
confidential  basis from a source other than the Borrower or its  Affiliates  or
(C)  was  available  to  such  Bank  on a  nonconfidential  basis  prior  to its
disclosure to such Bank by the Borrower or its Affiliates; or (iv) to the extent
the Borrower shall have consented to such disclosure in writing. As used in this
Section 9.17, as to any Bank, "Information" shall mean any financial statements,
materials,  documents  and other  information  that the  Borrower  or any of its
Affiliates  may  have  furnished  or may  hereafter  furnish  to  such  Bank  in
<PAGE>
connection  with this  Agreement  or any other  materials  prepared  by any such
person from any of the foregoing.

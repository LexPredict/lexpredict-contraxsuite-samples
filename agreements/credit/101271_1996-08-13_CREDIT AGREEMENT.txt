Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

NBD Bank, a Michigan banking corporation, (the "Bank"), is
pleased to inform you that it has approved a line of credit to
United Industrial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, ("United
Industrial"), and Detroit Stoker Company, a Michigan
corporation, ("Detroit Stoker"), in a principal amount not to
exceed NINE MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($9,000,000.00) in the
aggregate at any one time outstanding (the "Credit Facility"),
under the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement.
United Industrial and Detroit Stoker are sometimes referred to
individually as a "Borrower" and collectively as the
"Borrowers". Unless earlier withdrawn, the Credit Facility
shall expire on June 30, 1996 (the "Expiration Date"). The
Credit Facility is held available contingent upon the Bank's
continued satisfaction with each Borrower's managerial and
financial status. The Bank will extend loans to and issue
Letters of Credit for the account of either or both of the
Borrowers under the Credit Facility from the effective date of
this agreement until the earlier of the Expiration Date or the
Bank's withdrawal of the Credit Facility. Within the limits of
the Credit Facility and subject to the terms and conditions of
this agreement, prior to the Expiration Date, the Borrowers may
borrow, pay down and reborrow. Advances to Detroit Stoker under
the Credit Facility (including Letters of Credit) shall not
exceed the aggregate principal amount of ONE MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS (1,000,000.00).

1. Master Promissory Note. All borrowings under the
Credit Facility shall be evidenced by a Master Promissory Note
in the form attached as Exhibit A, executed concurrently with
this letter agreement (the "Master Note"). The Bank shall, in
the ordinary course of its business, record the date, amount,
interest rate and maturity of each borrowing, the amount of
each payment and other information. Such records shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive as to the outstanding
principal balance of and interest rate or rates applicable to
the Master Note.

2. Letters of Credit. The Credit Facility shall
include the issuance of standby letters of credit not exceeding
FOUR MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($4,000,000.00) in the
aggregate at any one time outstanding, THREE MILLION NINE
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($3,900,000.00) of which
must expire not later than

<PAGE>


June 30, 1997 and ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND 00/100 DOLLARS
($100,000.00) of which must expire not later than March 31,
1999. The foregoing standby letters of credit are collectively
referred to in this agreement as the "Letters of Credit." The
sum of (a) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
loans under the Credit Facility, plus (b) the aggregate
outstanding undrawn amount of the Letters of Credit, plus (c)
the aggregate amount disbursed on drafts drawn under Letters of
Credit for which the Bank has not yet been reimbursed shall not
exceed NINE MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($9,000,000.00) at any
one time outstanding. The sum of (a) the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all loans to Detroit Stoker under the
Credit Facility, plus (b) the aggregate outstanding undrawn
amount of Letters of Credit for the account of Detroit Stoker,
plus (c) the aggregate amount disbursed on drafts drawn under
Letters of Credit for the account of Detroit Stoker for which
the Bank has not yet been reimbursed shall not exceed ONE
MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($1,000,000.00) at any one time
outstanding. Each request for issuance of a Letter of Credit
shall be made by the Borrowers' execution and delivery to the
Bank of the Bank's standard form of Letter of Credit
Application, Reimbursement and Security Agreement (or such
other form as the Bank may reasonably require), appropriately
completed, not less than two business days prior to the
proposed date of issuance. From and after the occurrence of an
event of default described in Section 14 or the Expiration
Date, the Borrower shall maintain a special collateral account
(the "Letter of Credit Collateral Account") at the Bank, in the
name of the Borrower but under the sole dominion and control of
the Bank in which the Borrower shall have no interest other
than as set forth in Section 15 below. The Borrower grants the
Bank a security interest in the Letter of Credit Collateral
Account and any funds that may from time to time be on deposit
in that account to secure the prompt payment and performance of
all amounts owing from the Borrower to the Bank under this
agreement.

3. Interest Rates. Each loan under the Master Note
shall bear interest at the Bank's option at:

(a)      a rate established by the Bank in its sole
and absolute discretion (a "Negotiated
Rate"); or

(b)      the rate announced from time to time by the
Bank as its "prime rate" (the "Prime Rate");

The interest rate options that the Bank makes available to the
Borrowers from time to time will not necessarily be the most
favorable of the options listed above. The Bank, in its sole
discretion, may decline to make any of those options available
to the Borrowers at any given time. Negotiated, Rates may be
above or below the Prime Rate. Any rate under this agreement is
not necessarily the lowest rate charged by the Bank to any of
its customers.



<PAGE>


4. Maturities

(a) Maturities of Negotiated Rate Loans. Each loan
bearing interest at a Negotiated Rate shall be repayable at a
stated maturity (not to exceed 90 days) established by the
Bank at the time of the advance.


(b) Maturities of Prime Rate Loans. Each loan bearing
interest at the Prime Rate shall be payable on demand and the
rate shall be subject to change daily.

5. Interest Payments. Interest on each loan under
this agreement shall be due and payable at the stated
maturity, if any, or if the loan is payable on demand, on the
last day of each quarter commencing on December 31, 1995.

6. Fees and Expenses.

(a) Commitment Fee. The Borrowers shall pay the Bank
a commitment fee on the daily average of the unused portion of
the Credit Facility, from the effective date of this agreement
until the Expiration Date or withdrawal or cancellation of the
Credit Facility at the rate of one quarter of one percent
(1/4%) per annum. That fee shall be payable quarterly in
arrears, commencing December 31, 1995.

(b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrowers shall pay
the Bank at the time of issuance of each Letter of Credit a
commission with respect to that Letter of Credit equal to one
percent per annum of the maximum amount available to be drawn
under the Letter of Credit if the Letter of Credit has any
expiry of one year or less and one and one half percent per
annum if the Letter of Credit has an expiry in excess of one
year.

(c) Out-of-Pocket Expenses. In addition, the
Borrowers shall reimburse the Bank for its out-of-pocket
expenses and reasonable attorney's fees (including the fees of
in-house counsel) allocated to the Credit Facility.

7. Loan Request. Upon request given by telephone,
tested wire, or letter, by a person designated to the Bank as
the Borrowers' duly authorized representative, the Bank will
advance and credit to the account of one or both of the
Borrowers at the Bank, or transfer to another bank designated
by the Borrowers, such sums of money as may mutually be agreed
upon at the time of the request.

The Borrowers and the Bank each shall, upon the
request of the other, forward to the other a written
confirmation of any borrowing under this agreement (which
request may be made by facsimile), including confirmation of
the date, maturity, interest rate and amount of the loan. Any
loans with a maturity of 7 days or longer shall in all cases
require the Borrowers' written confirmation.

The Borrowers shall provide the Bank with a list of
the persons designated by them as their duly authorized
representatives. The Bank may act upon the written or oral
instructions of any person designated by the Borrowers as
their authorized representative.
<PAGE>
Each disbursement and repayment of a loan bearing
interest at a Negotiated Rate shall be in the minimum amount
of $1,000,000.00. Each disbursement and repayment of a loan
under the Credit Facility shall be made in immediately
available funds at the principal office of the Bank in
Detroit, Michigan.

8. Conditions Precedent. The Bank shall not be
obligated to make the initial extension of credit under the
Credit Facility unless prior to or simultaneously with that
extension of credit the Bank shall have received the following
documents in form and substance satisfactory to it and its
counsel (a) certified copies of such corporate documents of
each Borrower as the Bank shall reasonably request, including
a certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws, a
certificate of good standing, and documents evidencing
necessary corporate action with respect to this agreement and
the Master Note, (b) certified copies of such corporate

not delivered to the Bank by August 1, 1996, the Bank may
terminate the Credit Facility, declare all amounts owing under
the Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately and
exercise all remedies available to the Bank under this
agreement.

were made on that date; and (b) no default shall have occurred
under this agreement or the Master Note and be continuing or
will exist upon the making of the advance.

Borrowers to the Bank under the Credit Facility shall be

any related instrument or agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this agreement, or any course of conduct,
dealing, statements (whether oral or written), or actions of
any of them. Neither the Bank nor the Borrowers shall seek to
consolidate, by counterclaim or otherwise, any action in which

litigation based upon or arising out of this note, or any related instrument or
agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated by this note, or any course
of conduct, dealing, statements (whether oral or written), or actions of any of
them. Neither the Bank nor the Borrowers shall seek to consolidate, by

CONTINUING GUARANTY


GUARANTY: To induce NBD Bank (the "Bank"), of 611 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226-3497 at its option, to make loans, extend or continue credit or
some other benefit, including letters of credit and foreign exchange contracts,
present or future, direct and indirect, and whether several, joint or joint and
several (referred to collectively as "Liabilities"), to United Industrial

because the undersigned (the "Guarantor") has determined that executing this
Guaranty is in its interest and to its financial benefit, the Guarantor
absolutely and unconditionally guaranties to the Bank, as primary obligor and
not merely as surety, that the Liabilities will be paid when due, whether by
acceleration or otherwise. The Guarantor will not only pay the Liabilities, but
will also reimburse the Bank for accrued and unpaid interest, and any expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, that the Bank may pay in collecting from
the Borrower or the Guarantor, and for liquidating any collateral.

LIMITATION: The Guarantor's obligation under this Guaranty is
UNLIMITED. Unless otherwise specified below, the Guarantor's obligation shall be
payable in U.S. Dollars.

CONTINUED RELIANCE: The Bank may continue to make loans or extend
credit to the Borrower based on this Guaranty until it receives written notice
of termination from the Guarantor. That notice shall be effective at the opening
of the Bank for business on the day after receipt of the notice. If terminated,
the Guarantor will continue to be liable to the Bank for any Liabilities
created, assumed or committed to at the time the termination becomes effective,
and all subsequent renewals, extensions, modifications and amendments of the
Liabilities.

SECURITY: As security for the Guaranty, the Guarantor pledges and
grants to the Bank a continuing security interest in the following described
property and all of its additions, substitutions, increments, proceeds and
products, whether now owned or later acquired ("Collateral"):

2. All property or securities declared or acknowledged to constitute
security for any past, present or future liability, direct or indirect, of the
Guarantor to the Bank;

3. All balances of deposit accounts of the Guarantor with the Bank.

The Bank shall have the right at any time to apply its own debt or liability to
the Guarantor in whole or partial payment of this Guaranty or other present or
future liabilities, direct or indirect, without any requirement for mutual
maturity.

<PAGE>
If the Guarantor fails to pay any amount owing under this Guaranty, the
Bank shall have all of the rights and remedies provided by law or under any
other agreement to liquidate or foreclose on and sell the Collateral, including
but not limited to the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform
Commercial Code. These rights and remedies shall be cumulative and not
exclusive. If the Guarantor is entitled to notice, that requirement will be met
if the Bank sends notice at least seven (7) days prior to the date of sale,
disposition or other event which requires notice. The proceeds of any sale shall
be applied first to costs, then toward payment of the amount owing under this
Guaranty. The Bank is authorized to cause all or any part of the Collateral to
be transferred to or registered in its name or in the name of any other person,
firm or corporation, with or without designation of the capacity of such
nominee.

For purposes of the following paragraphs, "any collateral" shall
include the Guarantor's Collateral and any other collateral securing
the Liabilities.

ACTION REGARDING BORROWER: If any monies become available that the Bank
can apply to the Liabilities, the Bank may apply them in any manner it chooses,
including but not limited to applying them against liabilities which are not
covered by this Guaranty. The Bank can take any action against the Borrower, any
collateral, or any other person liable for any of the Liabilities. The Bank can
release the Borrower or anyone else from the Liabilities, either in whole or in
part, or release any collateral, and need not perfect a security interest in any
collateral. The Bank does not have to exercise any rights that it has against
the Borrower or anyone else, or make any effort to realize on any collateral or
right of set-off. If the Borrower requests more credit or any other benefit, the
Bank may grant it and the Bank may grant renewals, extensions, modifications and
amendments of the Liabilities and otherwise deal with the Borrower or any other
person as the Bank sees fit and as if this Guaranty were not in effect. The
Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty shall not be released or affected by
(a) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, sale or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, or any receivership,
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar proceedings affecting
the Borrower or any of its assets, or (b) any change in the composition or
structure of the Borrower or the Guarantor, including a merger or consolidation
with any other person or entity.

NATURE OF GUARANTY: This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection. Therefore, the Bank can insist that the Guarantor pay immediately,
and the Bank is not required to attempt to collect first from the Borrower, any
collateral, or any other person liable for the Liabilities. The obligation of
the Guarantor shall be unconditional and absolute, regardless of the
unenforceability of the Liabilities, or the existence of any defense, setoff or
counterclaim which the Borrower may assert.

OTHER GUARANTORS: If there is more than one Guarantor, their
obligations under this Guaranty shall be joint and several. In addition, each
Guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable with any other guarantor of the
Liabilities. If the Bank elects to enforce its rights against less than all
guarantors of the Liabilities, that election shall not release Guarantor from
its obligations under this Guaranty. The compromise or release of any of the
obligations of any of the other guarantors or the Borrower shall not serve to
waive, alter or release the Guarantor's obligations. This Guaranty is not
conditioned on anyone else executing this or any other guaranty.
<PAGE>
RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION: The Guarantor agrees not to enforce any rights
of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against the
Borrower, any entity liable for the Liabilities, or any collateral, until the
Liabilities are fully paid, even if all Liabilities are not covered by this
Guaranty. The Guarantor further agrees that if any payments to the Bank on the
Liabilities are in whole or in part invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party under any bankruptcy act or code, state or federal law, common law
or equitable doctrine, this Guaranty and the Bank's interest in any collateral
remain in full force and effect (or are reinstated as the case may be) until
payment in full of those amounts. That payment is due on demand.

WAIVERS: The Guarantor waives any right it may have to receive notice
of the following matters before the Bank enforces any of its rights: (a) the
Bank's acceptance of this Guaranty, (b) any credit that the Bank extends to the
Borrower, (c) the Borrower's default, (d) any demand, (e) any action that the
Bank takes regarding the Borrower, anyone else, any collateral, or any
Liability, which it might be entitled to by law or under any other agreement.
Any waiver shall affect only the specific terms and time period stated in the
waiver. The Bank may waive or delay enforcing any of its rights without losing
them. No modification or waiver of this Guaranty shall be effective unless it is
in writing and signed by the party against whom it is being enforced.

REPRESENTATIONS BY GUARANTOR: Each Guarantor represents: (a) that the
execution and delivery of this Guaranty and the performance of the obligations
it imposes do not violate any law, conflict with any agreement by which it is
bound, or require the consent or approval of any governmental authority or any
third party; (b) that this Guaranty is a valid and binding agreement,
enforceable according to its terms; and (c) that all balance sheets, profit and
loss statements, and other financial statements furnished to the Bank are
accurate and fairly reflect the financial condition of the organizations and
persons to which they apply on their effective dates, including contingent
liabilities of every type, which financial condition has not changed materially
and adversely since those dates. Each Guarantor, other than a natural person,
further represents: (a) that it is duly organized, existing and in good standing
pursuant to the laws under which it is organized; and (b) that the execution and
delivery of this Guaranty and the performance of the obligations it imposes (i)
are within its powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action of
its governing body; and (ii) do not contravene the terms of its articles of
incorporation or organization, its by-laws, or any partnership, operating or
other agreement governing its affairs.

NOTICES: Notice from one party to another relating to this Guaranty
shall be deemed effective if made in writing (including telecommunications) and
delivered to the recipient's address, telex number or facsimile number set forth
under its name by any of the following means: (a) hand delivery, (b) registered
or certified mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested, (c) first
class or express mail, postage prepaid, (d) Federal Express, Purolator Courier
or like overnight courier service or (e) facsimile, telex or other wire
transmission with request for assurance of receipt in a manner typical with
respect to communications of that type. Notice made in accordance with this
section shall be deemed delivered on receipt if delivered by hand or wire
transmission, on the third business day after mailing if mailed by first class,
registered or certified mail, or on the next business day after mailing or
deposit with an overnight courier service if delivered by express mail or
overnight courier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice of termination of this
Guaranty shall be deemed received only upon the receipt of actual written notice
by the Bank in accordance with the paragraph above labeled "Continued Reliance."

LAW AND JUDICIAL FORUM THAT APPLY: This agreement is governed by
Michigan law. The Guarantor agrees that any legal action or proceeding against
it with respect to any of its obligations under this Guaranty may be brought in
any court of the State of Michigan or of the United States of America for the
Eastern or Western District of Michigan, as the Bank in its sole discretion may
elect. By the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the Guarantor submits to
and accepts, with regard to any such action or proceeding, for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of
those courts. The Guarantor waives any claim that the State of Michigan is not a
convenient forum or the proper venue for any suit, action or proceeding.
<PAGE>
MISCELLANEOUS: The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty is
independent of its liability under any other guaranty previously or subsequently
executed by the Guarantor or one of them, singularly or together with others, as
to all or any part of the Liabilities, and may be enforced for the full amount
of this Guaranty regardless of the Guarantor's liability under any other
guaranty. This Guaranty is binding on the Guarantor's heirs, successors and
assigns, and will operate to the benefit of the Bank and its successors and
assigns. The use of headings shall not limit the provisions of this Guaranty.
All discussions and documents arising between this Guaranty and the last
guaranty signed by the Guarantor as to the Borrower are merged into this
Guaranty.

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: The Bank and the Guarantor, after consulting or
having had the opportunity to consult with counsel, knowingly, voluntarily and
intentionally waive any right either of them may have to a trial by jury in any
litigation based upon or arising out of this Guaranty or any related instrument
or agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty, or any
course of conduct, dealing, statements (whether oral or written), or actions of
either of them. Neither the Bank nor the Guarantor shall seek to consolidate, by
counterclaim or otherwise, any action in which a jury trial has been waived with
any other action in which a jury trial cannot be or has not been waived. These
provisions shall not be deemed to have been modified in any respect or
relinquished by either the Bank or the Guarantor except by a written instrument
executed by both of them.

CONTINUING GUARANTY


GUARANTY: To induce NBD Bank (the "Bank"), of 611 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226-3497 at its option, to make loans, extend or continue credit or
some other benefit, including letters of credit and foreign exchange contracts,
present or future, direct and indirect, and whether several, joint or joint and
several (referred to collectively as "Liabilities"), to Detroit Stoker Company,
a Michigan corporation and its successors (the "Borrower"), and because the
undersigned (the "Guarantor") has determined that executing this Guaranty is in
its interest and to its financial benefit, the Guarantor absolutely and
unconditionally guaranties to the Bank, as primary obligor and not merely as
surety, that the Liabilities will be paid when due, whether by acceleration or
otherwise. The Guarantor will not only pay the Liabilities, but will also
reimburse the Bank for accrued and unpaid interest, and any expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that the Bank may pay in collecting from the
Borrower or the Guarantor, and for liquidating any collateral.

LIMITATION: The Guarantor's obligation under this Guaranty is
UNLIMITED. Unless otherwise specified below, the Guarantor's obligation shall be
payable in U.S. Dollars.

CONTINUED RELIANCE: The Bank may continue to make loans or extend
credit to the Borrower based on this Guaranty until it receives written notice
of termination from the Guarantor. That notice shall be effective at the opening
of the Bank for business on the day after receipt of the notice. If terminated,
the Guarantor will continue to be liable to the Bank for any Liabilities
created, assumed or committed to at the time the termination becomes effective,
and all subsequent renewals, extensions, modifications and amendments of the
Liabilities.

SECURITY: As security for the Guaranty, the Guarantor pledges and
grants to the Bank a continuing security interest in the following described
property and all of its additions, substitutions, increments, proceeds and
products, whether now owned or later acquired ("Collateral"):

1. All securities and other property of the Guarantor in the custody,
possession or control of the Bank (other than property held by the Bank solely
in a fiduciary capacity);

2. All property or securities declared or acknowledged to constitute
security for any past, present or future liability, direct or indirect, of the
Guarantor to the Bank;

3. All balances of deposit accounts of the Guarantor with the Bank.

The Bank shall have the right at any time to apply its own debt or liability to
the Guarantor in whole or partial payment of this Guaranty or other present or

but not limited to the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform
Commercial Code. These rights and remedies shall be cumulative and not

if the Bank sends notice at least seven (7) days prior to the date of sale,
disposition or other event which requires notice. The proceeds of any sale shall
be applied first to costs, then toward payment of the amount owing under this
Guaranty. The Bank is authorized to cause all or any part of the Collateral to

it with respect to any of its obligations under this Guaranty may be brought in
any court of the State of Michigan or of the United States of America for the
Eastern or Western District of Michigan, as the Bank in its sole discretion may
elect. By the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the Guarantor submits to
and accepts, with regard to any such action or proceeding, for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of
those courts. The Guarantor waives any claim that the State of Michigan is not a

<PAGE>
MISCELLANEOUS: The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty is
independent of its liability under any other guaranty previously or subsequently
executed by the Guarantor or one of them, singularly or together with others, as
to all or any part of the Liabilities, and may be enforced for the full amount
of this Guaranty regardless of the Guarantor's liability under any other
guaranty. This Guaranty is binding on the Guarantor's heirs, successors and
assigns, and will operate to the benefit of the Bank and its successors and
assigns. The use of headings shall not limit the provisions of this Guaranty.
All discussions and documents arising between this Guaranty and the last
guaranty signed by the Guarantor as to the Borrower are merged into this
Guaranty.

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: The Bank and the Guarantor, after consulting or
having had the opportunity to consult with counsel, knowingly, voluntarily and
intentionally waive any right either of them may have to a trial by jury in any
litigation based upon or arising out of this Guaranty or any related instrument
or agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty, or any
course of conduct, dealing, statements (whether oral or written), or actions of
either of them. Neither the Bank nor the Guarantor shall seek to consolidate, by
counterclaim or otherwise, any action in which a jury trial has been waived with
any other action in which a jury trial cannot be or has not been waived. These
provisions shall not be deemed to have been modified in any respect or
relinquished by either the Bank or the Guarantor except by a written instrument
executed by both of them.

CONTINUING GUARANTY


GUARANTY: To induce NBD Bank (the "Bank"), of 611 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48226-3497 at its option, to make loans, extend or continue credit or
some other benefit, including letters of credit and foreign exchange contracts,
present or future, direct and indirect, and whether several, joint or joint and
several (referred to collectively as "Liabilities"), to Detroit Stoker Company,
a Michigan corporation and its successors (the "Borrower"), and because the
undersigned (the "Guarantor") has determined that executing this Guaranty is in
its interest and to its financial benefit, the Guarantor absolutely and
unconditionally guaranties to the Bank, as primary obligor and not merely as
surety, that the Liabilities will be paid when due, whether by acceleration or
otherwise. The Guarantor will not only pay the Liabilities, but will also
reimburse the Bank for accrued and unpaid interest, and any expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that the Bank may pay in collecting from the
Borrower or the Guarantor, and for liquidating any collateral.

LIMITATION: The Guarantor's obligation under this Guaranty is
UNLIMITED. Unless otherwise specified below, the Guarantor's obligation shall be
payable in U.S. Dollars.

CONTINUED RELIANCE: The Bank may continue to make loans or extend
credit to the Borrower based on this Guaranty until it receives written notice
of termination from the Guarantor. That notice shall be effective at the opening
of the Bank for business on the day after receipt of the notice. If terminated,
the Guarantor will continue to be liable to the Bank for any Liabilities
created, assumed or committed to at the time the termination becomes effective,
and all subsequent renewals, extensions, modifications and amendments of the
Liabilities.

SECURITY: As security for the Guaranty, the Guarantor pledges and
grants to the Bank a continuing security interest in the following described
property and all of its additions, substitutions, increments, proceeds and
products, whether now owned or later acquired ("Collateral"):

1. All securities and other property of the Guarantor in the custody,
possession or control of the Bank (other than property held by the Bank solely
in a fiduciary capacity);

2. All property or securities declared or acknowledged to constitute
security for any past, present or future liability, direct or indirect, of the
Guarantor to the Bank;

3. All balances of deposit accounts of the Guarantor with the Bank.

The Bank shall have the right at any time to apply its own debt or liability to
the Guarantor in whole or partial payment of this Guaranty or other present or
future liabilities, direct or indirect, without any requirement for mutual
maturity.
<PAGE>
If the Guarantor fails to pay any amount owing under this Guaranty, the
Bank shall have all of the rights and remedies provided by law or under any
other agreement to liquidate or foreclose on and sell the Collateral, including
but not limited to the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform
Commercial Code. These rights and remedies shall be cumulative and not
exclusive. If the Guarantor is entitled to notice, that requirement will be met
if the Bank sends notice at least seven (7) days prior to the date of sale,
disposition or other event which requires notice. The proceeds of any sale shall
be applied first to costs, then toward payment of the amount owing under this
Guaranty. The Bank is authorized to cause all or any part of the Collateral to
be transferred to or registered in its name or in the name of any other person,
firm or corporation, with or without designation of the capacity of such
nominee.

For purposes of the following paragraphs, "any collateral" shall
include the Guarantor's Collateral and any other collateral securing
the Liabilities.

ACTION REGARDING BORROWER: If any monies become available that the Bank
can apply to the Liabilities, the Bank may apply them in any manner it chooses,
including but not limited to applying them against liabilities which are not
covered by this Guaranty. The Bank can take any action against the Borrower, any
collateral, or any other person liable for any of the Liabilities. The Bank can
release the Borrower or anyone else from the Liabilities, either in whole or in
part, or release any collateral, and need not perfect a security interest in any
collateral. The Bank does not have to exercise any rights that it has against
the Borrower or anyone else, or make any effort to realize on any collateral or
right of set-off. If the Borrower requests more credit or any other benefit, the
Bank may grant it and the Bank may grant renewals, extensions, modifications and
amendments of the Liabilities and otherwise deal with the Borrower or any other
person as the Bank sees fit and as if this Guaranty were not in effect. The
Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty shall not be released or affected by
(a) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, sale or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, or any receivership,
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar proceedings affecting
the Borrower or any of its assets, or (b) any change in the composition or
structure of the Borrower or the Guarantor, including a merger or consolidation
with any other person or entity.

NATURE OF GUARANTY: This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection. Therefore, the Bank can insist that the Guarantor pay immediately,
and the Bank is not required to attempt to collect first from the Borrower, any
collateral, or any other person liable for the Liabilities. The obligation of
the Guarantor shall be unconditional and absolute, regardless of the
unenforceability of the Liabilities, or the existence of any defense, setoff or
counterclaim which the Borrower may assert.

OTHER GUARANTORS: If there is more than one Guarantor, their
obligations under this Guaranty shall be joint and several. In addition, each
Guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable with any other guarantor of the
Liabilities. If the Bank elects to enforce its rights against less than all
guarantors of the Liabilities, that election shall not release Guarantor from
its obligations under this Guaranty. The compromise or release of any of the
obligations of any of the other guarantors or the Borrower shall not serve to
waive, alter or release the Guarantor's obligations. This Guaranty is not
conditioned on anyone else executing this or any other guaranty.

RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION: The Guarantor agrees not to enforce any rights
of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against the
Borrower, any entity liable for the Liabilities, or any collateral, until the
Liabilities are fully paid, even if all Liabilities are not covered by this
Guaranty. The Guarantor further agrees that if any payments to the Bank on the
Liabilities are in whole or in part invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party under any bankruptcy act or code, state or federal law, common law
or equitable doctrine, this Guaranty and the Bank's interest in any collateral
remain in full force and effect (or are reinstated as the case may be) until
payment in full of those amounts. That payment is due on demand.
<PAGE>
WAIVERS: The Guarantor waives any right it may have to receive notice
of the following matters before the Bank enforces any of its rights: (a) the
Bank's acceptance of this Guaranty, (b) any credit that the Bank extends to the
Borrower, (c) the Borrower's default, (d) any demand, (e) any action that the
Bank takes regarding the Borrower, anyone else, any collateral, or any
Liability, which it might be entitled to by law or under any other agreement.
Any waiver shall affect only the specific terms and time period stated in the
waiver. The Bank may waive or delay enforcing any of its rights without losing
them. No modification or waiver of this Guaranty shall be effective unless it is
in writing and signed by the party against whom it is being enforced.

REPRESENTATIONS BY GUARANTOR: Each Guarantor represents: (a) that the
execution and delivery of this Guaranty and the performance of the obligations
it imposes do not violate any law, conflict with any agreement by which it is
bound, or require the consent or approval of any governmental authority or any
third party; (b) that this Guaranty is a valid and binding agreement,
enforceable according to its terms; and (c) that all balance sheets, profit and
loss statements, and other financial statements furnished to the Bank are
accurate and fairly reflect the financial condition of the organizations and
persons to which they apply on their effective dates, including contingent
liabilities of every type, which financial condition has not changed materially
and adversely since those dates. Each Guarantor, other than a natural person,
further represents: (a) that it is duly organized, existing and in good standing
pursuant to the laws under which it is organized; and (b) that the execution and
delivery of this Guaranty and the performance of the obligations it imposes (i)
are within its powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action of
its governing body; and (ii) do not contravene the terms of its articles of
incorporation or organization, its by-laws, or any partnership, operating or
other agreement governing its affairs.

NOTICES: Notice from one party to another relating to this Guaranty
shall be deemed effective if made in writing (including telecommunications) and
delivered to the recipient's address, telex number or facsimile number set forth
under its name by any of the following means: (a) hand delivery, (b) registered
or certified mail, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested, (c) first
class or express mail, postage prepaid, (d) Federal Express, Purolator Courier
or like overnight courier service or (e) facsimile, telex or other wire
transmission with request for assurance of receipt in a manner typical with
respect to communications of that type. Notice made in accordance with this
section shall be deemed delivered on receipt if delivered by hand or wire
transmission, on the third business day after mailing if mailed by first class,
registered or certified mail, or on the next business day after mailing or
deposit with an overnight courier service if delivered by express mail or
overnight courier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice of termination of this
Guaranty shall be deemed received only upon the receipt of actual written notice
by the Bank in accordance with the paragraph above labeled "Continued Reliance."

LAW AND JUDICIAL FORUM THAT APPLY: This agreement is governed by
Michigan law. The Guarantor agrees that any legal action or proceeding against
it with respect to any of its obligations under this Guaranty may be brought in
any court of the State of Michigan or of the United States of America for the
Eastern or Western District of Michigan, as the Bank in its sole discretion may
elect. By the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the Guarantor submits to
and accepts, with regard to any such action or proceeding, for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of
those courts. The Guarantor waives any claim that the State of Michigan is not a
convenient forum or the proper venue for any suit, action or proceeding.

MISCELLANEOUS: The Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty is
independent of its liability under any other guaranty previously or subsequently
executed by the Guarantor or one of them, singularly or together with others, as
to all or any part of the Liabilities, and may be enforced for the full amount

guaranty. This Guaranty is binding on the Guarantor's heirs, successors and
assigns, and will operate to the benefit of the Bank and its successors and
assigns. The use of headings shall not limit the provisions of this Guaranty.
All discussions and documents arising between this Guaranty and the last
guaranty signed by the Guarantor as to the Borrower are merged into this
Guaranty.

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: The Bank and the Guarantor, after consulting or
having had the opportunity to consult with counsel, knowingly, voluntarily and
intentionally waive any right either of them may have to a trial by jury in any
litigation based upon or arising out of this Guaranty or any related instrument
or agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated by this Guaranty, or any
course of conduct, dealing, statements (whether oral or written), or actions of
either of them. Neither the Bank nor the Guarantor shall seek to consolidate, by
counterclaim or otherwise, any action in which a jury trial has been waived with
any other action in which a jury trial cannot be or has not been waived. These
provisions shall not be deemed to have been modified in any respect or
relinquished by either the Bank or the Guarantor except by a written instrument
executed by both of them.

or the Loans comprising such Borrowing, are bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to
the Alternate Base Rate.



“Adjusted LIBO Rate” means, with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing for any Interest
Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to
(a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate.



“Administrative Agent” means Fortis Bank SA/NV, New York Branch, in its capacity as
administrative agent for the Lenders hereunder, and its successors in that capacity.



“Administrative Questionnaire” means an Administrative Questionnaire in a form
supplied by the Administrative Agent.



“Affiliate” means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that directly,

“Alternate Base Rate” means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a)
the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) the Prime Rate in
effect on such day. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the
Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective from and including the effective date of such
change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.



“Applicable Percentage” means, with respect to any Lender, the percentage of the total
Commitments represented by such Lender’s Commitment. If the Commitments have terminated





















or expired, the Applicable Percentages shall be determined based upon the Commitments most
recently in effect, giving effect to any assignments.



“Applicable Margin” means, for any day with respect to any ABR Loan or Eurodollar Loan
r, as the case may be, the applicable margin per annum set forth on Schedule 1.01 hereto
under the caption “ABR Applicable Margin” or “Adjusted LIBO Applicable Margin”, as the case may be,
based upon the ratings by Moody’s and S&P, respectively, applicable on such date to the Index Debt.
For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if both Moody’s and S&P shall not have in effect a rating for
the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this
definition), then such rating agencies shall be deemed to have established a rating in Category 6,
and if either (but not both), Moody’s and S&P shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt
(other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this definition),
then the remaining rating shall control; (ii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been
established by Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within different Categories, the
Applicable Margin shall be based on the higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is
two or more Categories lower than the other, in which case the Applicable Margin shall be
determined by reference to the Category next below that of the higher of the two ratings; and (iii)
if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt
shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody’s or S&P), such
change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating
agency, irrespective of when notice of such change shall have been furnished to the Agent and the
Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01 or otherwise. Each change in the Applicable Margin shall
apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date
immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moody’s
or S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating
corporate debt obligations, Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating
agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be
determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.

SECTION 2.02 Loans and Borrowings.



(a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Type made
by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender
to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations
hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required. The Term Loans made by each

B-1 payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to the applicable Term Loan
Commitment of such Lender, and otherwise duly completed and the Bridge Loans made by each Lender
shall be evidenced by a single Note of Borrower in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2
payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to the applicable Bridge Loan
Commitment of such Lender, and otherwise duly completed (such notes, together with all renewals,
extensions, modifications and replacements thereof and substitutions therefor, being herein called
a “Note” and collectively called the “Notes”). Each Lender is hereby authorized by
Borrower to endorse on the schedule (or a continuation thereof) that may be attached to each Note
of such Lender, to the extent applicable, the date, amount, type of and the applicable period of
interest for each Loan made by such Lender to Borrower hereunder, and the amount of each payment or
prepayment of principal of such Loan received by such Lender, provided, that any failure by such
Lender to make any such endorsement shall not affect the obligations of Borrower under such Note or
hereunder in respect of such Loan.



14















(b) Subject to Section 2.12, each Loan shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or
Eurodollar Loans as Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may
make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to
make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation
of Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or otherwise result
in an increased cost to Borrower.



(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing
shall be in an aggregate amount that is equal to $1,000,000 or an increment of $100,000 in excess
thereof. At the time that each ABR Loan is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount
that is equal to $1,000,000 or an increment of $100,000 in excess thereof. Borrowings of more than
one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be
more than a total of five (5) Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.



(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) Borrower shall not be entitled
to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with
respect thereto would end after the Term Loan Maturity Date or the Bridge Loan Maturity Date, as
the case may be, and (ii) Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or
continue, any Borrowing which is a Term Loan if after giving effect thereto the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Eurodollar Borrowings which are Term Loans with Interest
Periods ending on or prior to any applicable scheduled repayment date plus the aggregate principal
amount of outstanding ABR Borrowings which are Term Loans would be less than the aggregate
principal amount of Term Loans required to be repaid on such scheduled repayment date.

Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not
later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, two Business Days before the date of the proposed
Borrowing and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than noon, New York City time, on the
date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and
shall be confirmed by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent on the same day as the
telephonic request of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent
and signed by Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.02:




(i) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

(v) the location and number of Borrower’s account to which funds are to be disbursed,
which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.05.

then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the

The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to Borrower by promptly crediting the
amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of Borrower maintained with the Administrative
Agent and designated by Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request.



(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent
such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. If a
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative
Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such
amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing.



SECTION 2.06 Interest Elections.



(a) Each Loan initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request
and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in
such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different
Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest
Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. Borrower may elect different options with
respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case



16

















each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising
such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
Borrowing.



(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent of such election by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, two Business Days before the proposed Borrowing and (b) in the case of an
ABR Borrowing, not later than noon, New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing.
Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent on the same day as such telephonic request of a
written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by
Borrower.



(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following
information:




(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different
options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof
to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
resulting Borrowing);




(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election
Request, which shall be a Business Day;




(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
Borrowing; and




(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be
applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period
contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.



If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an
Interest Period, then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s
duration.



(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall
advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.



(e) If Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a
Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such
Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required
Lenders, so notifies Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no
outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii)



17

















unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of
the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan,
accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to
the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on
the effective date of such conversion.



(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that
interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number
of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate
Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.



SECTION 2.12 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:



(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO
Rate for such Interest Period; or



(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate
for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or
Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such
Interest Period;



then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or
telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any
Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any
Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request
requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided
that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the
other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.



SECTION 2.13 Increased Costs.



(a) If any Change in Law shall:




(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or




(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting
this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;



21














and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest
or otherwise), then Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.




(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of
such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such
Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved
but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of
such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower
will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.



(c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or
(b) of this Section shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within
10 days after receipt thereof.



(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided
that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any
increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender
notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of
such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof.



SECTION 2.14 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable
thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow,
convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto regardless of whether such notice may be revoked and is revoked in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.17, then, in any such event, Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss,
cost and expense attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be
deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount
of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not
occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the



22














Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid,
at the commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from
other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or
amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.




SECTION 2.15 Taxes.



(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrower hereunder or under any
other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes; provided that if Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Borrower shall make
such deductions and (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law.



(b) In addition, Borrower shall pay any applicable Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law.



(c) Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after
written demand therefor, for the full amount of any applicable Indemnified Taxes or applicable
Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect
to any payment by or on account of any obligation of Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan
Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as
to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.



(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by Borrower
to a Governmental Authority, Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy
of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent.



(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax
under the law of the jurisdiction in which Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such
jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to Borrower
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable



23














law or reasonably requested by Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate.




(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has
received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes or “gross-up” payment as to which it has been
indemnified by Borrower or with respect to which Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to
this Section 2.15, it shall pay over such refund to Borrower (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this Section 2.15
with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket
expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest
paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that Borrower,
upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over
to Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such
Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be
construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or
any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to Borrower or any other
Person.



SECTION 2.16 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.



(a) Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other
Loan Document (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section
2.13, 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required
hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly
required, prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available
funds, without set-off, deduction or counterclaim. Any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent
that are received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent,
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating
interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at
101 Hudson Street, 21st Floor, Jersey City, NJ 07302, except that payments pursuant to
Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the
Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons
specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for
the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.
If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date
for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment
accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All
payments under each Loan Document shall be made in Dollars.



(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative
Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall
be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such
parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.



24















(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise,
obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans, resulting in such
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued
interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other
Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all
or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by
Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of
its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of its Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Lender agrees
that it will not exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise obtain payment in
respect of any Obligation owed to it other than principal of and interest accruing on the Loans,
unless all of the outstanding principal of and accrued interest on the Loans have been paid in
full. Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements
may exercise against Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.



(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date
on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder
that Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has
made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, without obligation, in reliance upon
such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. If Borrower has not in fact made such
payment when due, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day
from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation.



(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to this
Agreement, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary
provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations hereunder until all such unsatisfied
obligations are fully paid.



SECTION 2.17 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.



(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the



25














account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if,
in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future
and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise
be disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.




(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any
Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans
hereunder, then Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights
and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i)
Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such assignor Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be
required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by
such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and
delegation cease to apply.



SECTION 2.18 Defaulting Lender.



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event any Lender (x) has
refused (which refusal constitutes a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement)
to make available its portion of any Loan or (y) notifies either the Administrative Agent or
Borrower that such Lender does not intend to make available its portion of any Loan (if the actual
refusal would constitute a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) (each, a
“Lender Default”), all rights and obligations hereunder of such Lender (a “Defaulting Lender”) as
to which a Lender Default is in effect and of the other parties hereto shall be modified to the
extent of the express provisions of this Section while such Lender Default remains in effect.



(b) Loans shall be made pro rata by Lenders (the “Non-Defaulting Lenders”) which are not
Defaulting Lenders based on their respective Commitments) and no Commitment of any Lender or any
pro rata share of any Loans required to be advanced by any Lender shall be increased as a result of
such Lender Default. Amounts received in respect of principal of any type of Loans shall be
applied to reduce the applicable Loans of each Lender pro rata based on the aggregate of the
outstanding Loans of that type of all Lenders at the time of such application;



26














provided, that, such amount shall not be applied to any Loans of a Defaulting Lender at any
time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of Loans of any Non-Defaulting Lender
exceeds such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment of all Loans then outstanding.




(c) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give instructions to the Administrative Agent
or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any matters relating to this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. All amendments, waivers and other modifications of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents may be made without regard to a Defaulting Lender and, for purposes of the
definition of “Required Lenders,” a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and not to
have Loans outstanding.



(d) Other than as expressly set forth in this Section, the rights and obligations of a
Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to indemnify the Administrative Agent) and the other
parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to release any
Defaulting Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, shall
alter such obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender
hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may
have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder.



(e) In the event a Defaulting Lender retroactively cures to the satisfaction of the
Administrative Agent the breach which caused a Lender to become a Defaulting Lender, such
Defaulting Lender shall no longer be a Defaulting Lender and shall be treated as a Lender under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.



ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties




Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:



SECTION 3.01 Organization; Powers. Each of Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and,
except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such
qualification is required.



SECTION 3.02 Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions to be entered into by
Borrower are within Borrower’s powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan
Document to which Borrower is to be a party, when executed and delivered by Borrower, will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.



SECTION 3.03 Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do not
require any material consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by,



27














any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force
and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents of Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries or any order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any material indenture,
agreement or other instrument binding upon Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries or their
assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by Borrower or any of
its Material Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries.




SECTION 3.04 Financial Condition. Borrower has heretofore furnished to the
Administrative Agent its consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations, stockholders’
equity and cash flows as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007,
reported on by Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent registered public accounting firm. Such
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results
of operations and cash flows of Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for
such periods in accordance with GAAP. Since December 31, 2007 through the date of Borrower’s
execution of this Agreement, there has been no material adverse change in the business, assets,
operations, prospects or condition, financial or otherwise, of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, other than as a result of industry conditions generally (subject to the W-H exchange
offer closing substantially concurrent herewith).



SECTION 3.05 Properties.



(a) Each of Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, all its real and personal property material to its business, except for minor defects
in title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or
to utilize such properties for their intended purposes.



(b) Each of Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all
trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its
business, and the use thereof by Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the
rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that could not reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 3.06 Litigation and Environmental Matters.



(a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Borrower, threatened against or affecting
Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries (i) as to which, in the reasonable judgment of
Borrower, there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely
determined, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that
involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.



(b) Except with respect to any other matters that, in the reasonable judgment of Borrower,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither Borrower nor any
of its Material Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain,
maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under



28














any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has
received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis
for any Environmental Liability.




SECTION 3.07 Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of Borrower and its Material
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority
applicable to it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon
it or its property, except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.



SECTION 3.08 Investment Company Status. Neither Borrower nor any of its Material
Subsidiaries is an “investment company” as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Investment Company Act of 1940.



SECTION 3.09 Taxes. Each of Borrower and its Material Subsidiaries has timely filed
or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have been filed and has paid or
caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which Borrower or the applicable
Material Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the
extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.



SECTION 3.10 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur
that, when taken together with all other ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to
occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of
all accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent
financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of such
Plan, and the present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based
on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did
not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the
fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans, in each of such cases so as to cause
a Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 3.11 Disclosure. Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all agreements,
instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which Borrower or any of its Material
Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to Borrower, that could reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of the reports, financial statements, certificates or
other information furnished by or on behalf of Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered
hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains
any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, taken as a whole, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

ARTICLE V

Affirmative Covenants

SECTION 5.01 Financial Statements; Ratings Change and Other Information. Borrower
will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender:



(a) within 105 days after the end of each fiscal year, Borrower’s audited consolidated balance

aware of the same, furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender written notice of the
following:



(a) the occurrence of any Default;

or Governmental Authority against or affecting Borrower or any of its Affiliates that, if adversely

have occurred, results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect;
and



(d) any other development that results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Material Adverse Effect.



Each notice delivered under this Section shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the
details of the event or development requiring such notice and any action taken or proposed to be
taken with respect thereto.



SECTION 5.03 Existence; Conduct of Business. Borrower will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in
full force and effect its legal existence and the rights, licenses, permits, privileges and
franchises



32














material to the conduct of its business; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any
merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 6.03.




SECTION 5.04 Payment of Obligations. Borrower will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, pay its obligations, including Tax liabilities, that, if not paid, could result in
a Material Adverse Effect before the same shall become delinquent or in default, except where (a)
the validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b)
Borrower or its applicable Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
thereto in accordance with GAAP and (c) the failure to make payment pending such contest could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 5.05 Maintenance of Properties; Insurance. Borrower will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, (a) keep and maintain all property material to the conduct of its
business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and (b) maintain,

representatives designated by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, upon reasonable prior notice
to Borrower, to visit and inspect its properties, to examine and make extracts from its books and
records, and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its officers and independent
accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested.



SECTION 5.07 Compliance with Laws. Borrower will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority

offer and (iv) for other general corporate purposes. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be
used, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose that entails a violation of any of the
Regulations of the Board, including Regulations T, U and X, or to fund any activity or business
with any Person or in or with any country or territory which in any manner would result in a
violation by any Person of any sanction or prohibition imposed by a Governmental Authority.



SECTION 5.09 Financial Covenants. Borrower will have and maintain, on a consolidated
basis, a Debt to Capitalization Ratio of not greater than 40%.

secure only those obligations which it secures on the date of such acquisition or the date such

(d) Liens on fixed or capital assets acquired, constructed or improved by Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries; provided that (i) such security interests secure Indebtedness permitted by

transaction or in a series of transactions) all or substantially all of its assets, or all or
substantially all of the stock of any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, whether now owned or
hereafter acquired), or liquidate or dissolve, except that, so long as at the time thereof and

extent in any business other than businesses of the type conducted by Borrower and its Subsidiaries
on the date of execution of this Agreement and businesses reasonably related thereto.

in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or

37















ARTICLE VIII

The Administrative Agent




Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers
as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.



The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers
in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
other Affiliates as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.



The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set
forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the
Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of
whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c)
except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any
duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not
be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct, BUT REGARDLESS OF THE PRESENCE OF ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE. The Administrative
Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof
is given to the immediate officers of the Administrative Agent responsible for this Agreement by
Borrower or a Lender and is called a “notice of default”, and the Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any
Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.



The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for
relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other
writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone



38














and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for
any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants
or experts.




The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs
shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any
such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication
of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.



Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in
this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may (and, in the event (i) neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Affiliate, as a Lender, has any outstanding Loans and (ii) the Required Lenders so
request, the Administrative Agent shall) resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor, with
the prior written consent of Borrower (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred which is
continuing, in which event Borrower’s consent shall not be required). If no successor shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which
shall be a bank with an office in New York City, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and
such successor. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this
Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.



Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time
deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

SECTION 9.02 Waivers; Amendments.



(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document
or consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same
shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and



40

















for the purpose for which given. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of such Default at the time.



(b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may
be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or
agreements in writing entered into by Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Administrative Agent and Borrower, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Term Loan Commitment or the Bridge
Loan Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal
amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of
payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled
date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(iv) change Section 2.16(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of
the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision of
any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify
any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the
written consent of each Lender, or (vi) terminate or modify any indemnity provided to a Lender
hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of such Lender; provided
further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
the Administrative Agent without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.



SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.



(a) Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements
of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan Documents or any
amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or
protection of its rights in connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this
Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.



(b) Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party
of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against,
and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any



41

















Indemnitee,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective
obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby or the enforcement of any obligations hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence
or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated
by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or
any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that
such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee (or any of its Related Parties), BUT THE PRESENCE OF ORDINARY
NEGLIGENCE SHALL NOT AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH INDEMNITY.



(c) To the extent that Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the
Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of
the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender’s “pro rata share”
shall be determined based upon (without duplication) its share of the sum of the total outstanding
Loans at the time.



(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability,
for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions or any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.



(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than three Business Days
after written demand therefor.



SECTION 9.04 Successors and Assigns.



(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) no
Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by Borrower without
such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights
or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in
paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated



42

















hereby, the
Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.



(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender
may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of: (A) Borrower, provided that no consent
of Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved
Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other
assignee; and (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent
shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a Lender immediately prior to giving
effect to such assignment or an Affiliate of such a Lender.



(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the
case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire
remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Loans, neither the amount of the Loans retained by the
assigning Lender nor the amount of the Loans being assigned (in each case, determined as of the
date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall be less than the Minimum Hold Amount unless Borrower and the
Administrative Agent otherwise consent (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld), provided
that no such consent of Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing; (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of
all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement; (C) the parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,
together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and (E) in the
case of an assignment to a CLO (as defined below), the assigning Lender shall retain the sole right
to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, provided that
the Assignment and Assumption between such Lender and such CLO may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of such CLO, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in
the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such CLO.


For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the terms “Approved Fund” and “CLO” have the
following meanings:





“Approved Fund” means (a) a CLO and (b) with respect to any Lender that is a
fund which invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit, any other fund that
invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit and is managed by the same investment
advisor as such Lender or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor.




“CLO” means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or otherwise)
that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in bank loans and
similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and is administered or
managed by a Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender.



(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of
this



43

















Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and
the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph
(e) of this Section.



(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain
at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
“Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error,
and Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice.



(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning
Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee
shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in
paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by
paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be
effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in
this paragraph.



(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion
of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (C) Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (D) no such participation may be
sold to any entity which is engaged principally in the oilfield products and services business
unless Borrower shall have given its prior written consent. Any agreement or instrument pursuant
to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification
or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects



44

















such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, Borrower agrees that each Participant shall
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to the same
extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(c) as though it were a Lender.



(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section
2.13 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign
Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless
Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for
the benefit of Borrower, to comply with Section 2.15(e) as though it were a Lender.



(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or
assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.



SECTION 9.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties
made by Borrower in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of
the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such
other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may
have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal
of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement
is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15
and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect
regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans,
the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.



SECTION 9.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which
shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect
to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and



45

















thereafter
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement
by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.



SECTION 9.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision
in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.



SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time
to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any
time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of Borrower against any
of and all the obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such
Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement
and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may
have.



SECTION 9.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.



(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK.



(b) Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to
the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any
Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law,
in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action
or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to
bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against
Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.



(c) Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.



46















(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law.



SECTION 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES
HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.



SECTION 9.11 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used
herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect
the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.



SECTION 9.12 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and
agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required by
any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required in the opinion of legal counsel by applicable
laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this
Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an
agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any
assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its
advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to Borrower and its obligations, (g) with
the consent of Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other
than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) is disclosed to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis by a source other than Borrower, which disclosure is not the
result of a breach of a duty of confidentiality owed by the discloser to Borrower if such breach
was reasonably discoverable by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may
be. For the purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from
Borrower relating to Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is known to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this




47

















Section shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same
degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information.




SECTION 9.13 Interest Rate Limitation. Borrower and the Lenders intend to strictly
comply with all applicable federal and New York laws, including applicable usury laws (or the usury
laws of any jurisdiction whose usury laws are deemed to apply to the Notes or any other Loan
Documents despite the intention and desire of the parties to apply the usury laws of the State of
New York). Accordingly, the provisions of this Section shall govern and control over every other
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which conflicts or is inconsistent with this
Section, even if such provision declares that it controls. As used in this Section, the term
“interest” includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other compensation which
constitute interest under applicable law, provided that, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be characterized as an expense or as
compensation for something other than the use, forbearance or detention of money and not as
interest, and (b) all interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be
amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, using the actuarial method, during the full term of the
Notes. In no event shall Borrower or any other Person be obligated to pay, or any Lender have any
right or privilege to reserve, receive or retain, (a) any interest in excess of the maximum amount
of nonusurious interest permitted under the laws of the State of New York or the applicable laws
(if any) of the United States or of any other jurisdiction, or (b) total interest in excess of the
amount which such Lender could lawfully have contracted for, reserved, received, retained or
charged had the interest been calculated for the full term of the Notes at the Ceiling Rate. The
daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at the Ceiling Rate shall be determined by
dividing the applicable Ceiling Rate per annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which
such calculation is being made. None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in
any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, Article VII hereof) which directly
or indirectly relate to interest shall ever be construed without reference to this Section, or be
construed to create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money at any
interest rate in excess of the Ceiling Rate. If the term of any Note is shortened by reason of
acceleration or maturity as a result of any Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any
required or permitted prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any
Lender at any time, including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed or receives
(and/or has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Ceiling Rate, then and in
any such event all of any such excess interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of
such acceleration, prepayment or other event which produces the excess, and, if such excess
interest has been paid to such Lender, it shall be credited pro tanto against the then-outstanding
principal balance of Borrower’s obligations to such Lender, effective as of the date or dates when
the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest, until such excess is exhausted or all of
such principal has been fully paid and satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance
of such excess shall be promptly refunded to its payor.



SECTION 9.14 Syndication Agents and Documentation Agents. The entities named as
Syndication Agents and Documentation Agents hereunder, in such capacities, shall have no rights,
powers, duties, obligations or liabilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,
but to the extent that for any reason any Person makes a claim against entities, in



48

















their
capacities as Syndication Agents or Documentation Agents and not as a Lender, the indemnification
provisions in Article VIII and in Section 9.03 shall apply.



SECTION 9.15 USA Patriot Act. Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the
USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the
“Act”) hereby notifies Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is
required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Borrower, which information
includes the name and address of Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to
identify Borrower in accordance with the Act.



49

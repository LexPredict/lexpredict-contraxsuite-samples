ARTICLE 2 - THE LOAN; USE OF PROCEEDS

2.1      Credit Facility.

(a)          Advances.  From time to time during the Availability Period, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Lender shall make Advances to the Borrower, which the Borrower may repay and reborrow, up to an aggregate outstanding principal amount not to exceed at any time the Commitment then in effect. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that the amounts to be advanced hereunder are available on a stand
by basis solely to fund customer withdrawal obligations of the Guarantor, as such obligations become due, and shall be available to the Borrower only after the Guarantor has received the Additional 1031 Liquidity and would have less than US$5,000,000.00 of aggregate cash and cash equivalents available after funding the applicable customer withdrawal obligations then due. The Availability Period may be extended upon the mutual written agreement of the Lender and the Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, make or permit to remain outstanding Advances under the Loan in excess of the original principal amount of the Note, and all such amounts shall (i) be part of the Obligations evidenced by the Note, (ii) bear interest as provided herein, (iii) be payable upon demand by the Lender, and (iv) be entitled to all rights and security as provided hereunder and the other Loan Documents.

(b)          Advances shall be made by the Lender upon its receipt from the Borrower of an Advance Request, in form satisfactory to the Lender, delivered to the Lender no later than 12:00 noon (Eastern Time) on the Business Day prior to the date of the requested Advance, setting forth the amount of the Advance requested and the proposed Advance Date (which shall be a Business Day), together with a certificate executed by the Borrower (i) certifying that, as of the proposed Advance Date, the aggregate cash and cash equivalents on hand of the Guarantor would be less than US$5,000,0
00.00 after giving effect to the payment of the applicable customer withdrawal obligations then due, (ii) setting forth the amount and type of customer withdrawals from the Guarantor that will be funded with the Advance, (iii) certifying that all of the proceeds of the requested Advance will be used to fund the customer withdrawals therein so described, and (iv) certifying as to the other matters set forth in Section 4.2. The Advance Request shall also provide such other information as the Lender may require. The Lender's acceptance of such a request shall be indicated only upon its making the Advance requested.

(c)          All Advances shall be disbursed in immediately available funds directly from the Lender to the Guarantor, and the Borrower hereby authorizes the Lender to disburse directly to the Guarantor any and all Advances.

(d)          Without limiting the foregoing, upon the occurrence of any Default, the Lender may, without notice to the Borrower or the Guarantor, decline to make any additional Advances to or for the benefit of the Borrower or the Guarantor.

2.2      Note.  The indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lender under the Commitment will be evidenced by the Note executed by the Borrower in favor of the Lender. The maximum

8






principal amount of the Note will be the amount of the Commitment as of the date hereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding the face amount of such Note, the borrowings evidenced thereby shall be limited at all times to its actual indebtedness, principal and interest then outstanding.

2.3      Principal Repayment Generally.

(a)          The Loan shall be repaid in full, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all fees, expenses and other amounts due hereunder, on the Maturity Date.

(b)          The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of and interest on the Loan and fees, expenses or reimbursements hereunder not later than 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date when due, without set off, counterclaim or other deduction, in immediately available funds to the Lender at such address as the Lender may instruct. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loan or of fees, expenses or reim
bursements shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

2.4      Mandatory Repayments and Reduction of the Commitment.

(a)          Upon the sale, transfer, assignment or disposition of any of the Collateral, the Guarantor shall provide all of the proceeds therefrom (net only of reasonable commissions, selling expenses and customary transaction costs) to the Borrower to prepay the Loan in an amount equal to all of such cash proceeds. Required prepayments under this
Section 2.4(a) shall be made within one (1) Business Day after receipt of the proceeds by the Guarantor, provided that the Borrower shall cause the Guarantor to instruct the securities intermediary that is in possession of the securities account in which the sold securities are held to pay such proceeds directly to the Lender in immediately available funds immediately upon receipt. Upon a prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.4(a), the Commitment shall be reduced by an amount (as calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in this Section 2.4(a), the “Pro Rata Commitment Decrease”) equal to the product of:

(x)          (i) the par amount of principal of the Collateral so sold, transferred, assigned or otherwise disposed of divided by (ii) the aggregate par amount of principal of all Collateral
as of the date thereof, multiplied by

(y)          the Commitment as of the date thereof.

(b)          At any time during the Availability Period that the aggregate cash and cash equivalents on hand of the Guarantor exceeds US$5,000,000.00 by at least US$250,000.00, the Guarantor shall provide such excess (excluding any excess resulting from customer deposits made after the date hereof) to the Borrower to prepay the Loan in an amount equal to such excess. Amounts prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) shall

9






not permanently reduce the Commitment unless expressly requested in writing by the Borrower in connection with such prepayment.

(c)          All prepayments shall be in immediately available funds and, unless otherwise agreed to by the Lender at the time of such prepayment, shall be applied as follows:

(i)          First, to the payment of any fees, expenses or reimbursements then owing to the Lender hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents,

(ii)          Second, to the payment of all accrued but unpaid interest on the Loan, and

(iii)          Third, to repay the principal amount outstanding under the Loan.

2.5      Voluntary Prepayment.

Upon one (1) Business Day’s prior written notice by the Borrower to the Lender, the Borrower may prepay, in whole or in part, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan, together with all interest thereon, without premium or penalty. Amounts prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall not permanently reduce the Commitment unless expressly requested in writing by the Borrower in connection with such prepayment.

2.6      Interest.

(a)          Rate.  The Loan shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate in effect from time to time, accruing from and including the date on which the pri
ncipal amounts are advanced to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof.

(b)          Payment and Calculation of Interest.  The Borrower shall pay interest on the outstanding principal amount of the Loan quarterly in
arrears on the last day of each January, April, July, and October and on the day on which any principal is repaid (including voluntary prepayments), and on the Maturity Date. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed.

2.7      Use of Proceeds.  Advances shall be available only during the Availability Period and the proceeds of each Advance shall be used solely to fund customer withdrawal obligations of the Guarantor, as such obligations become due, and shall be available to the Borrower only after the Guarantor has received the Additional 1031 Liquidity and would have less than US$5,000,000.00 of aggregate cash and cash equivalents available after giving effect to the funding of the applicable customer withdrawal obligations then due.

ARTICLE 3 - COLLATERAL

10






Loan due or to become due (together with any extensions, modifications, substitutions, increases and renewals thereof, and substitutions therefor), certain or contingent, now existing or hereafter arising, which are now, or may at any time or times hereafter be owing by the Borrower to the Lender, the Borrower has caused (or prior to making any Advance Request, will cause) the Guarantor to pledge and grant to the Lender (for itself and its successors and permitted assigns) a continuing first lien on and security interest in and upon all of the Guarantor's right, title and interest in, to and under the Collateral, pursuant to the Guaranty and Security Agreement. In addition, the Borrower shall also cause to be delivered to the Lender an account control agreement among the Lender, the Guarantor and each of the securities intermediaries that hold securities accounts in which the securities constituting the Collateral are held (each, an "Account Control Agreement" and collectively, the "Account Control Agreements"). Each Account Control Agreement shall be in favor of the Lender, in the customary form providing the Lender with "control" over the securities accounts in which the securities constituting the Collateral are held, and otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lender. For the purposes hereof, all lower case terms used in the definition of “Collateral” that are defined in, or referenced in, Article 9 of the UCC, have the meanings provided in the UCC.

(a)          It is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing in the jurisdiction of its incorporation and, except where the failure to do so could not re

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Loan Document, and the making of the Advances hereunder will not violate any law, government rule or regulation, or any writ, order or decree of any court or governmental authority, or conflict with the organizational documents, minutes or resolutions of the Borrower or the Guarantor or violate or constitute a default under, or (except for the Liens created under the Loan Documents) result in the creation of any Lien upon any of its property or assets pursuant to (immediately or with the passage of time), any law, regulation, contract, agreement or instrument to which the Borrower or the Guarantor is a party, or by whic

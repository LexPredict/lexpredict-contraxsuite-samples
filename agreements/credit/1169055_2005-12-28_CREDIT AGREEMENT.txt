CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as December 22, 2005, among NOBLE CORPORATION, a Cayman Islands
exempted company limited by shares (“Parent”), NOBLE HOLDING (U.S.) CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (“NHC” and, together with Parent, the “Parent Guarantors”), NOBLE DRILLING CORPORATION
(the “Borrower”), a Delaware corporation, and GOLDMAN SACHS CREDIT PARTNERS L.P. (“GSCP”), as
initial Lender and Administrative Agent (in such capacity the “Administrative Agent”). Unless
otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein and defined in Section 10 are used
herein as so defined.




W I T N E S S E T H:




WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into this Agreement to make available to the
Borrower a loan facility in an aggregate principal amount as provided for herein;




NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed:




SECTION 1. Amount and Terms of Credit.




1.01 Commitment. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, each
Lender severally agrees to make a loan or loans (each a “Loan” and, collectively, the “Loans”)
under the Facility to the Borrower on the Closing Date in an amount equal to such Lender’s
Commitment.




1.02 Reserved




1.03 Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at its Notice
Office, prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time), at least three Business Days’ prior written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing), or such shorter time as the Lenders may agree, of
a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans and at least one Business Day’s prior written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be made hereunder. Such
notice (the “Notice of Borrowing”) shall be in the form of Exhibit A and shall be irrevocable and
shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be made on the Closing Date, (ii)
the date of Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and (iii) whether the Borrowing shall consist
of Base Rate Loans or (to the extent permitted) Eurodollar Loans and, if Eurodollar Loans, the
Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give
each Lender written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of the proposed
Borrowing, of such Lender’s proportionate share thereof and of the other matters covered by the
Notice of Borrowing.




1.04 Disbursement of Funds. (a) No later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date specified in the Notice of Borrowing,
each Lender will make available its pro rata share of the Borrowing requested to be
made on such date in the manner provided below. All such amounts shall be made available to the
Administrative Agent in Dollars and immediately available funds at the Payment Office and the
Administrative Agent promptly will make available to the Borrower by depositing to its account at
the Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so made available in Dollars and immediately
available funds. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to
the date of Borrowing that























such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative
Agent its portion of the Borrowing to be made on the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of
Borrowing, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole
discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by
such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available same to the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If
such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand
therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall
(within two Business Days of receiving such demand) pay such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover on demand from
such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect
of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent
to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at
a rate per annum equal to (x) if paid by such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate or
(y) if paid by the Borrower, the then applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with
Section 1.08, for the respective Loans.




(b) Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its
commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have against any Lender as
a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.




1.05 Notes. (a) The Borrower’s obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the
Loan made to it by each Lender shall be evidenced in the Register maintained by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 13.16, and shall, if requested by such Lender, also be evidenced by a
promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B with blanks appropriately completed in
conformity herewith (each a “Note” and, collectively, the “Notes”).




(b) The Note issued to each Lender shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to
the order of such Lender and be dated the Closing Date or, if issued after the Closing Date, be
dated the date of issuance thereof, (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the Loans held
by such Lender on such date and be payable in the outstanding principal amount of the Loans
evidenced thereby, (iv) mature on the Maturity Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the
appropriate clause of Section 1.08 in respect of the outstanding Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar
Loans, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to mandatory repayment as provided in Section 4.02 and (vii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents.




(c) Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of each Loan made by it and each
payment in respect thereof and will, prior to any transfer of any of its Notes, endorse on the
reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make
any such notation or any error in such notation shall not affect the Borrower’s obligations in
respect of such Loans.




1.06 Conversions. The Borrower shall have the option to convert on any Business Day all
or a portion at least equal to the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount of the





















outstanding principal amount of Loans into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another Type of Loan, provided that (i)
except as otherwise provided in Section 1.10(b), Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate
Loans only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto and no partial conversion of a
Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans
made pursuant to such Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto and
(ii) no Base Rate Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Loans at any time when a Specified Default
is in existence on the date of the conversion if the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
have determined that such a conversion would be disadvantageous to the Lenders. Each such
conversion shall be effected by the Borrower giving the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office,
prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time), at least three Business Days’ (or one Business Day’s, in the
case of a conversion into Base Rate Loans) prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) (each a “Notice of Conversion”) specifying the Loans to be so converted, the
Type of Loans to be converted into and, if to be converted into a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans,
the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt
notice of any such proposed conversion to each Lender with Loans affected thereby.




1.07 Pro Rata Borrowings. All Loans under this Agreement shall be made by the Lenders
pro rata on the basis of their Commitments. It is understood that no Lender shall
be responsible for any default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans hereunder and
that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder,
regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder.




1.08 Interest. (a) The unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall at all times be the Base Rate in effect from time to
time.




(b) The unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest from the date of
the Borrowing thereof until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum
which shall at all times be the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Eurodollar Margin.




(c) All overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of
each Loan and any other overdue amount payable hereunder shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to 2% per annum in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to such Loans from time to time
(or, if such amounts do not relate to a specific Loan, 2% in excess of the Base Rate as in effect
from time to time), with such interest payable on demand.




(d) Interest shall accrue from and including the date of any Borrowing to but excluding the
date of any repayment thereof and shall be payable (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, quarterly
in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, (ii) in respect of
each Eurodollar Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case
of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three month intervals
after the first day of such Interest Period, (iii) in respect of each Eurodollar Loan, on any
prepayment or conversion (on the amount prepaid or converted) and (iv) in respect of each Loan, at
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.






















(e) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance with Section 13.07(b).




(f) The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for any Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans for any Interest Period, shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders
thereof.




1.09 Interest Periods. (a) At the time the Borrower gives the Notice of Borrowing or a
Notice of Conversion in respect of the making of, or conversion into, a Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans (in the case of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or on the third Business Day
prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to an outstanding Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans (in the case of any subsequent Interest Period), the Borrower shall have the right to elect,
by giving the Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in
writing) thereof, the interest period (each, an “Interest Period”) applicable to such Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans, which Interest Period shall be a one month period. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained above:





(i) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall commence on
the date of such Borrowing (including the date of any conversion from a Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall
commence on the day on which the immediately preceding Interest Period expires;




(ii) if any Interest Period begins on a day for which there is no numerically
corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest
Period shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;




(iii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business
Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day, provided that if
any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in
such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the immediately preceding Business Day;




(iv) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Maturity Date; and




(v) no Interest Period may be elected at any time when a Specified Default is then in
existence if the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders have determined that such an
election at such time would be disadvantageous to the Lenders.



(b) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period, the Borrower has failed to (or may not)
elect a new Interest Period to be applicable to the respective Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans as
provided above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing into a
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.




1.10 Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that (x) in the case of clause
(i) below, the Administrative Agent or (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender





















shall have determined (which determination shall, absent demonstrable error, be final and
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):





(i) on any date for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period that, by
reason of any changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the interbank
Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable
interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or




(ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur actual increased costs or reductions in
the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Eurodollar Loans because of
(x) any change since the date of this Agreement in any applicable law, governmental rule,
regulation, guideline or order (whether or not having the force of law) or in the
interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or
governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (such as, for example, but not limited to:
(A) without duplication of any amounts payable under Section 4.04(a), a change in the basis
of taxation or payment to any Lender of the principal of or interest on such Eurodollar
Loans or any other amounts payable hereunder (except for changes with respect to any tax
imposed on, or determined by reference to, the net income or net profits of such Lender
pursuant to the laws of the United States, the jurisdiction in which such Lender is
organized or in which such Lender’s principal office or applicable lending office is located
or any subdivision thereof or therein), or (B) a change in official reserve requirements,
but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in
the computation of the Eurodollar Rate) and/or (y) other circumstances occurring after the
date of this Agreement and affecting the interbank Eurodollar market; or




(iii) at any time since the date of this Agreement, that the making or continuance of
any Eurodollar Loan has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with any
law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such governmental rule, regulation, guideline, request or order not
having the force of law but with which such Lender customarily complies even though the
failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or has become impracticable as a result
of a contingency occurring after the date of this Agreement which materially and adversely
affects the interbank Eurodollar market;


then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent in the case of clause (i)
above) shall (x) on such date and (y) within ten Business Days of the date on which such event no
longer exists, give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and to the
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly
transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar
Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative
Agent no longer exist, and the Notice of Borrowing or any Notice of Conversion given by the
Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans which have not yet been incurred shall be deemed
rescinded by the Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall, subject to
Section 1.12(b) (to the extent applicable), pay to such Lender, upon written demand therefor, such
additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of




















calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required
to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder (a
written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, showing the basis for the
calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent demonstrable error, be
final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii)
above, the Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 1.10(b) as promptly as
possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.




(b) At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the circumstances described in
Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected
pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(iii), the Borrower shall) either (i) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is
then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, cancel said Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent
telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date that the Borrower was
notified by a Lender pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), or (ii) if the affected Eurodollar
Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent,
require the affected Lender to convert each such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan, provided
that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the
same pursuant to this Section 1.10(b).




(c) If any Lender shall have determined that after the date of this Agreement, the adoption
or effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any
change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law but with which such Lender customarily complies even though
the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s
capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below
that which such Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies with respect to capital adequacy),
then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall, subject to Section 1.12(b) (to the extent applicable),
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction. Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that
any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c), will give prompt written
notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall set forth the basis of the calculation of such
additional amounts, although the failure to give any such notice shall not release or diminish any
of the Borrower’s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 1.10(c) upon the
subsequent receipt of such notice.




1.11 Compensation. The Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request
(which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such compensation), for all reasonable
losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such
Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans but excluding in any event the loss of anticipated profits)
which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the
Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a





















date specified therefor in the Notice of Borrowing or any Notice of Conversion (whether or not withdrawn by the Borrower or
deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section 1.10(a)); (ii) if any prepayment, repayment or conversion of
any of its Eurodollar Loans occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period
applicable thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Loans is not made on any date
specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower; or (iv) as a consequence of (x) any
other default by the Borrower to repay its Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this
Agreement or (y) an election made pursuant to Section 1.10(b) or 1.14. A Lender’s basis for
requesting compensation pursuant to this Section 1.11 and a Lender’s calculation of the amount
thereof, shall, absent demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties
hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.11, GSCP agrees that it will
not make any claim under this Section 1.11 in its capacity as Lender for such losses, expenses and
liabilities described in this Section 1.11.




1.12 Change of Lending Office; Limitation on Indemnities. (a) Each Lender agrees that,
upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii),
1.10(c) or 4.04 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable
efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending
office for any Loan, or Commitments affected by such event, provided that such designation
is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or
regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to
the operation of any such Section. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall affect or postpone any of
the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Section 1.10 or 4.04.




(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any notice
required by Section 1.10 or 4.04 is given by any Lender more than 90 days after such Lender
obtained, or reasonably should have obtained, knowledge of the occurrence of the event giving rise
to the additional costs of the type described in such Section, such Lender shall not be entitled to
compensation under Section 1.10 or 4.04 for any amounts incurred or accruing prior to the date
which is 90 days prior to the giving of such notice to the Borrower.




1.13 Replacement of Lenders. (x) Upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the
operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 1.10(c) or Section 4.04 with respect to any
Lender which results in such Lender charging to the Borrower increased costs in excess of those
being charged by the other Lenders or becoming incapable of making Eurodollar Loans, (y) if a
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender and/or (z) as provided in Section 13.12(b), in the case of a
refusal by a Lender to consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect
to this Agreement which has been approved by the Required Lenders, the Borrower shall have the
right, if no Default or Event of Default then exists, to replace such Lender (the “Replaced
Lender”) with one or more other Eligible Transferee or Transferees reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent, none of which Transferees shall constitute a Defaulting Lender at the time of
such replacement (collectively, the “Replacement Lender”), provided that (i) at the time of
any replacement pursuant to this Section 1.13, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more
Assignment and Assumption Agreements pursuant to Section 13.04(b) (and with all fees payable
pursuant to said Section 13.04(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the
Replacement Lender shall acquire all of the Commitments and






















outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay to (x) the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an
amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of the
Replaced Lender, and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender (other than
those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price
has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender
concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective Assignment and Assumption
Agreements, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so requested

SECTION 4. Payments.




4.01 Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to prepay Loans in whole or
in part, without premium or penalty, from time to time on the following terms and conditions: (i)
the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay the Loans, the amount of
such prepayment and (in the case of Eurodollar Loans) the specific Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant
to which made, which notice shall be given by the Borrower at least one Business Day prior to the date of such
prepayment with respect to Base Rate Loans and three Business Days prior to the date of such
prepayment with respect to Eurodollar Loans, which notice shall promptly be transmitted by the
Administrative Agent to each of the Lenders; (ii) each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be
in an aggregate principal amount of at least $500,000 and, if greater in an integral multiple of
$100,000, provided that no partial prepayment of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a
Borrowing shall reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding pursuant to such
Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto; (iii) Eurodollar
Loans may only be prepaid pursuant to this Section 4.01 on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, unless prior prepayment is accompanied by all breakage costs owing pursuant to
Section 1.11 in connection therewith; and (iv) each prepayment in respect of any Loans made
pursuant to a Borrowing shall be distributed pro rata among the Lenders which made
such Loans, provided that, at the Borrower’s election in connection with any prepayment of
Loans pursuant to this Section 4.01, such prepayment shall not be applied to any Loans of a
Defaulting Lender.




4.02 Mandatory Repayments.




(A) Requirements:




(a) If on any date any Loan Party shall issue any Indebtedness which is permitted by Section
9.03(b) or (g) (other than Indebtedness under the Amended and Restated Credit





















Agreement), the Borrower shall repay within one Business Day of such date the principal of Loans in an aggregate
amount equal to the net cash proceeds from such issuance of Indebtedness.




(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, all then
outstanding Loans shall be repaid in full on the Maturity Date.




(c) On the date on which any Change of Control occurs, unless otherwise agreed by the
Required Lenders, the outstanding principal amount of all Loans, if any, shall become due and
payable in full.




(B) Application:




With respect to each prepayment of Loans required by Section 4.02, the Borrower may designate
the Types of Loans which are to be prepaid and the specific Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to
which made, provided that (i) repayments of Eurodollar Loans may only be made pursuant to
this Section 4.02 on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto unless no Base Rate
Loans remain outstanding; (ii) if any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a single
Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than
the Minimum Borrowing Amount for such Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be converted into Base Rate
Loans at the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto; and (iii) each prepayment
of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among the
Lenders which made such Loans. In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the
preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in
its sole discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section
1.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.02(B), if at any time the mandatory prepayment of Loans pursuant to Section
4.02(A) above would result, after giving effect to the procedures set forth above, in the Borrower
incurring breakage costs under Section 1.11 as a result of Eurodollar Loans being prepaid other
than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (the “Affected Eurodollar Loans”),
then the Borrower may in its sole discretion initially deposit a portion (up to 100%) of the
amounts that otherwise would have been paid in respect of the Affected Eurodollar Loans with the
Administrative Agent (which deposit must be equal in amount to the amount of the Affected
Eurodollar Loans not immediately prepaid) to be held as security for the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and shall provide for investments in Cash
Equivalents satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, with such cash collateral to
be directly applied upon the first occurrence (or occurrences) thereafter of the last day of an
Interest Period applicable to the relevant Loans that are Eurodollar Loans (or such earlier date or
dates as shall be requested by the Borrower), to repay an aggregate principal amount of such Loans
equal to the Affected Eurodollar Loans not initially prepaid pursuant to this sentence.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the immediately preceding sentence, all
amounts deposited as cash collateral pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be held
for the sole benefit of the Lenders whose Loans would otherwise have been immediately prepaid with
the amounts deposited and upon the taking of any action by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
pursuant to the remedial provisions of Section 10, any amounts held as cash collateral pursuant to
this Section 4.02(B) shall, subject to the requirements of applicable law, be immediately applied
to such Loans.






















4.03 Method and Place of Payment. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all
payments under this Agreement shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the ratable (based on
its pro rata share) account of the Lenders entitled thereto, not later than 1:00
P.M. (New York time) on the date when due and shall be made in immediately available funds and in
lawful money of the United States at the Payment Office, it being understood that written notice by
the Borrower to the Administrative Agent to make a payment from the funds in the Borrower’s account
at the Payment Office shall constitute the making of such payment to the extent of such funds held
in such account. Any payments under this Agreement which are made later than 1:00 P.M. (New York
time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment
to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date
thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of
principal, interest shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect
immediately prior to such extension.




4.04 Net Payments. (a) All payments made by any Credit Party hereunder or under any Note
will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except as provided in Section 4.04(b),
all such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever
nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but excluding, except as provided in
the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender
pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or managed and controlled or the
jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located
or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with
respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other
charges being referred to collectively as “Taxes”). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the
Borrower and each Parent Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to pay the full amount of such
Taxes, and such additional amounts, if any, as may be necessary so that every payment of all
amounts due under this Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on
account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. If any
amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Borrower agrees to
reimburse each Lender, upon the written request of such Lender, for taxes imposed on or measured by
the net income or net profits of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or under the laws of any
political subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction in which the principal office or
applicable lending office of such Lender is located and for any withholding of taxes as such Lender
shall determine are payable by, or withheld from, such Lender in respect of such amounts so paid to
or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts paid
to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence. The Borrower will furnish to the
Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date the payment of any Tax is due pursuant to
applicable law certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrower. The
Borrower and each Parent Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless
each Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes so
levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.






















(b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior
to the date of this Agreement, or in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an
interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04 (unless the respective Lender was
already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date of such
assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender’s
entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to
be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not a “bank” within the
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8ECI or W-8BEN pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit E (any such certificate, a “Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate”) and (y) two accurate and
complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form)
certifying to such Lender’s entitlement to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax
with respect to payments of interest to be made under this Agreement and under any Note. In
addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the date of this Agreement, when a lapse
in time or change in circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any
material respect, it will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two new accurate and
complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN (with respect to
the benefits of any income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other
forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments
under this Agreement and any Note, or it shall immediately notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.04(a), but subject to Section 13.04(b) and the
immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required
to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts
payable hereunder for the account of any Lender which is not a United States person (as such term
is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the extent
that such Lender has not provided to the Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that
establish a complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be
obligated pursuant to Section 4.04(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect
of income or similar taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the
Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Borrower pursuant to
this Section 4.04(b) or (II) in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described
in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such Forms do not establish a complete exemption from
withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding
sentence or elsewhere in this Section 4.04 and except as set forth in Section 13.04(b), the
Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in
Section 4.04(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or
withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately
preceding sentence as a result of any changes after the date of this Agreement in any applicable
law, treaty,





















governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof,
relating to the deducting or withholding of income or similar Taxes, provided such Lender
shall provide to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent any reasonably available applicable IRS
tax form (reasonably similar in its simplicity and lack of detail to IRS Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN)
necessary or appropriate for the exemption or reduction in the rate of such U.S. federal
withholding tax.




(c) The provisions of this Section 4.04 shall be subject to Section 1.12(b) (to the extent
applicable).

(b) (i) The consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower at December 31, 2004 and the related
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the Borrower for the fiscal year, as the
case may be, ended as of said date, which have been examined by PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP,

be material to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except as incurred subsequent to
December 31, 2004 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices.




7.11 Tax Returns and Payments. Each of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all
federal income tax returns and all other material tax returns, domestic and foreign, required to be
filed by it and has paid all material taxes and assessments payable by it which have become due,
other than those not yet delinquent and except for those contested in good faith. Parent and each
of its Subsidiaries has paid, or has provided adequate reserves (in the good faith judgment of the
management of Parent) for the payment of, all federal, state and foreign income taxes applicable
for all prior fiscal years and for the current fiscal year to the date hereof.




7.12 Compliance with ERISA. (a) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever maintained or contributed to (or had an obligation to contribute to) any Plan or
any Foreign Pension Plan where any current or reasonably foreseeable liability of Parent with
respect to such Plan or such Foreign Pension Plan would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. All contributions required to be made with respect to (i) any employee pension
benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) maintained or contributed to by (or to which
there is an obligation to contribute of) Parent or a Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate and (ii) any
Foreign Pension Plan have been timely made except any such failures to contribute which would not
individually or in the aggregate be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Parent
and its Subsidiaries may cease contributions to or terminate any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained or contributed to by (or to which there is an
obligation to contribute of) any of them without incurring any liability which, individually or in
the aggregate would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.




(b) Each Foreign Pension Plan has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms
and with the requirements of any and all applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders
and has been maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities, except such non-compliances as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.




7.13 Patents, etc. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has obtained all material patents,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses and other rights, free from burdensome
restrictions, that are necessary for the operation of their businesses taken as a whole as
presently conducted.






















7.14 Pollution and Other Regulations. (a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws governing its business for which failure to
comply is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is liable for any material penalties, fines or forfeitures for failure to comply with
any of the foregoing. All licenses, permits, registrations or approvals required for the business
of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries, as conducted as of the Closing Date, under any
Environmental Law have been secured and Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is in substantial
compliance therewith, except such licenses, permits, registrations or approvals the failure to
secure or to comply therewith is not likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in any respect in noncompliance with, breach of or default under any
applicable writ, order, judgment, injunction, or decree to which Parent or such Subsidiary is a
party or which would affect the ability of Parent or such Subsidiary to operate any material asset
and no event has occurred and is continuing which, with the passage of time or the giving of notice
or both, would constitute noncompliance, breach of or default thereunder, except in each such case,
such noncompliance, breaches or defaults as are not likely to, in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. There are as of the Closing Date no Environmental Claims pending or, to the
knowledge of any Credit Party, after due inquiry, threatened, against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would be reasonably likely to have
a Material Adverse Effect. There are no facts, circumstances, conditions or occurrences on any
Real Property, offshore drilling rig, vessel or other facility owned or operated by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries that is reasonably likely (i) to form the basis of an Environmental Claim
against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any Real Property, offshore drilling rig, vessel or
other facility owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) to cause such Real Property,
offshore drilling rig, vessel or other facility to be subject to any restrictions on its ownership,
occupancy, use or transferability under any Environmental Law, except in each such case, such
Environmental Claims or restrictions that individually or in the aggregate are not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.




(b) Hazardous Materials have not at any time been (i) generated, used, treated or stored on,
or transported to or from, any Real Property, offshore drilling rig, vessel or other facility at
any time owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) released on or from any
such Real Property, offshore drilling rig, vessel or other facility, in each case where, to the
knowledge of any Credit Party, after due inquiry, such occurrence or event individually or in the
aggregate is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.




7.15 Properties. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has title to all material properties

SECTION 12. The Administrative Agent.




12.01 Appointment. The Lenders hereby designate GSCP as Administrative Agent to act as
specified herein and in the other Credit Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and
each holder of any Note by the acceptance of such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize,
the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement,
the other Credit Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein or therein
and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically
delegated to or required of the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any of its
duties hereunder by or through its respective officers, directors, agents, employees or Affiliates
(including by appointing one or more of its banking Affiliates to act as Administrative Agent
hereunder).




12.02 Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, agents, employees
or Affiliates shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any
other Credit Document or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by its or their gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder of any Note; and nothing
in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so
construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement
or any other Credit Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein.




12.03 Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. Independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the holder of each Note, to the extent it deems
appropriate, has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the
financial condition and affairs of Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with the making and
the continuance of the Loans and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and
(ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Parent and its Subsidiaries and, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any


















duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder of
any Note with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its
possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter. The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals,
statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or
other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness,
validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Credit Document or the financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries or be required
to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions
or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the financial condition of Parent
and its Subsidiaries or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default.




12.04 Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent shall
request instructions from the Required Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure
to act) in connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders; and the
Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without
limiting the foregoing, neither any Lender nor the holder of any Note shall have any right of
action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting
or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Credit Document in accordance with the
instructions of the Required Lenders.




12.05 Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex,
teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message
signed, sent or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be the proper Person,
including, without limitation, counsel to Parent and its Subsidiaries, and, with respect to all
legal matters pertaining
to this Agreement and any other Credit Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon
advice and statements of legal counsel.




12.06 Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed and
indemnified by the Borrower, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent, in
proportion to their respective “percentages” as used in determining the Required Lenders, for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions,
judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on,
asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its respective duties
hereunder or under any other Credit Document, in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence,
willful misconduct or unlawful act.




12.07 The Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity. With respect to its obligation
to make Loans under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights and powers
specified herein for a “Lender” and may exercise the same rights and powers as


















though it were not
performing the duties specified herein; and the term “Lenders,” “Required Lenders,” “holders of
Notes” or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent may accept deposits
from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with
Parent or its Subsidiaries or any Affiliate thereof as if it were not performing the duties
specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account
for the same to the Lenders.




12.08 Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the
owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment, transfer
or endorsement thereof, as the case may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent.
Any request, authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving
such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or indorsee, as the case may be, of such Note or of any
Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.




12.09 Resignation by the Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may resign
from the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder and/or under the other Credit
Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days’ prior written notice to the Borrower and the
Lenders. Such resignation shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Administrative
Agent pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided below.




(b) Upon any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor
Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a commercial bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.




(c) If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed within such 15
Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, shall then appoint
a successor Administrative Agent who shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder
until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided above.




(d) If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant to clause (b) or (c)
above by the 20th Business Day after the date such notice of resignation was given by the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent’s resignation shall become effective and the
Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder
and/or under any other Credit Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided above.




SECTION 13. Miscellaneous.




13.01 Payment of Expenses, etc. The Borrower agrees to (and to cause each other Credit
Party, in respect of the Credit Document to which it is a party, to): (i) whether or not the
transactions herein contemplated are consummated, pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of the Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to


















therein and any
amendment, waiver or consent relating thereto (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of Latham & Watkins LLP) and of the Administrative Agent and, after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each of the Lenders in connection
with the enforcement of the Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to therein
(including, without limitation, the actual reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Administrative Agent and, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
for each of the Lenders), provided that to the extent it is feasible and a conflict of
interest does not exist in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
their counsel, the Lenders shall use the same counsel in connection with the foregoing; (ii) pay
and hold each of the Lenders harmless from and against any and all present and future stamp and
other similar taxes with respect to the foregoing matters and save each of the Lenders harmless
from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or omission
(other than to the extent attributable to such Lender) to pay such taxes; and (iii) indemnify each
Lender (including in its capacity as the Administrative Agent), its officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents from and hold each of them harmless against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out of,
or in any way related to, or by reason of, (a) any investigation, litigation or other proceeding
(whether or not any Lender is a party thereto) related to the entering into and/or performance of
any Credit Document or the use of the proceeds of any Loans hereunder or the consummation of any
transactions contemplated in any Credit Document, whether initiated by the Borrower or any other
Person, including, without limitation, the actual reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding (but excluding
any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of the
gross negligence, willful misconduct, unlawful act or material breach of the terms of this
Agreement of the Person to be indemnified) or (b) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous
Materials in the air, surface water, groundwater, surface or subsurface of any Real Property,
offshore drilling rig, vessel or other facility or location at any time owned or operated by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, the generation, storage, transportation or disposal of Hazardous
Materials at any Real Property, offshore drilling rig, vessel or other facility or location at any
time owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the non-compliance of any Real
Property, offshore drilling rig, vessel or other facility or location at any time owned or operated
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with federal, state and local laws, regulations, and
ordinances (including applicable permits thereunder) applicable to any such Real Property, offshore
drilling rig, vessel or other facility or location, or any Environmental Claim asserted against
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, or any Real Property, offshore drilling rig, vessel or other
facility or location at any time owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including,
in each case, without limitation, the actual reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and other
consultants incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding (but
excluding any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of
the gross negligence, willful misconduct, unlawful act of the Person to be indemnified. To the
extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay or hold harmless the Administrative Agent or any

Lender set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law
or public policy, the Borrower shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction
of each of the indemnified liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.



















13.02 Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable
law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, if an Event of Default then
exists, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind to the Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice
being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits
(general or special) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender (including
without limitation by branches and agencies of such Lender wherever located) to or for the credit
or the account of the Borrower against and on account of the Obligations and liabilities of the
Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement or under any of the other Credit Documents, including,
without limitation, all interests in Obligations of the Borrower purchased by such Lender pursuant
to Section 13.06(b), and all other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected
with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall
have made any demand hereunder and although said Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of
them, shall be contingent or unmatured. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender agrees to use
reasonable efforts to notify the Borrower of any exercise of such Lender’s right of setoff granted
hereby.




13.03 Notices. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telex or telecopier communication) and
mailed, telexed, telecopied or delivered, if to Parent, the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, at the
address specified opposite its signature below or in the other relevant Credit Documents, as the
case may be; if to any Lender, at its address specified for such Lender on Annex II; or, at such
other address as shall be designated by any party in a written notice to the other parties hereto.
All such notices and communications shall be effective when received and, in the case of notice by
telecopier, after confirmation of such receipt has been given by the recipient, excluding by way of
automatic receipt produced by telecopier.




(b) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to confirm in writing any
telephonic notice permitted to be given hereunder, the Administrative Agent, may prior to receipt
of written confirmation act without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice, believed by
the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the Borrower. In each
such case, the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent’s record of the
terms of such telephonic notice.




13.04 Benefit of Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto,
provided that no Credit Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lenders. Each Lender may at any time grant
participations in any of its rights hereunder or under any of the Notes to another financial
institution, provided that in the case of any such participation, the participant shall not
have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participant’s rights
against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement
executed by such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by
the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation,
except that the participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 1.10 and 4.04 of this
Agreement to the extent that such Lender would be entitled to such benefits if the participation
had not been entered into or sold, and, provided further, that no Lender shall transfer,
grant or




















assign any participation under which the participant shall have rights to approve any
amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such
amendment or waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note in which such
participant is participating or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon
(except in connection with a waiver of the applicability of any post-default increase in interest
rates), or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase such participant’s participating
interest in any Commitment over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a
waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment, or a
mandatory prepayment, shall not constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment) or (ii) consent
to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) any Lender may assign all or a portion of its
outstanding Commitment and its rights and obligations hereunder to its Affiliate or to another
Lender, and (y) with the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), any Lender may assign all or a portion of its outstanding
Commitment and its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more Eligible Transferees. No
assignment pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall, to the extent such assignment is
made to an institution other than one or more Lenders hereunder, be in an aggregate amount less
than $10,000,000 unless the entire Commitment of the assigning Lender is so assigned. If any
Lender so sells or assigns all or a part of its rights hereunder or under the Notes, any reference
in this Agreement or the Notes to such assigning Lender shall thereafter refer to such Lender and
to the respective assignee to the extent of their respective interests and the respective assignee
shall have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided therein), the same rights
and benefits as it would if it were such assigning Lender. Each assignment pursuant to this
Section 13.04(b) shall be effected by the assigning Lender and the assignee Lender executing an
Assignment and Assumption Agreement. In the event of any such assignment (x) to a commercial bank
or other financial institution not previously a Lender hereunder, either the assigning or the
assignee Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent a nonrefundable assignment fee of $3,500 and
(y) to a Lender, either the assigning or assignee Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent a
nonrefundable assignment fee of $1,500, and at the time of any assignment pursuant to this Section
13.04(b), (i) Annex I shall be deemed to be amended to reflect the Commitment of the respective
assignee (which shall result in a direct reduction to the Commitment of the assigning Lender) and
of the other Lenders, and (ii) if any such assignment occurs after the Closing Date, if requested
by the assigning Lender and the assignee Lender, the Borrower will issue new Notes to the
respective assignee and to the assigning Lender in conformity with the requirements of Section
1.05. Each Lender and the Borrower agree to execute such documents (including, without limitation,
amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents) as shall be necessary to effect the
foregoing. Nothing in this clause (b) shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from pledging its Notes
or Loans to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal
Reserve Bank.




(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 13.04, no transfer or assignment of
the interests or obligations of any Lender hereunder or any grant of participation therein shall be
permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant would require the Borrower or either Parent
Guarantor to file a registration statement with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the “Blue
Sky” laws of any State.






















(d) Each Lender initially party to this Agreement hereby represents, and each Person that
became a Lender pursuant to an assignment permitted by this Section 13 will, upon its becoming
party to this Agreement, represent that it is a commercial lender, other financial institution or
other “accredited” investor (as defined in SEC Regulation D) which makes loans in the ordinary
course of its business and that it will make or acquire Loans for its own account in the ordinary
course of such business, provided that subject to the preceding clauses (a) and (b), the
disposition of any promissory notes or other evidences of or interests in Indebtedness held by such
Lender shall at all times be within its exclusive control.




13.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under
any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and
the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Lender
would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in any case
shall entitle Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any other or further notice or demand in similar
or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.




13.06 Payments Pro Rata. (a) The Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its
receipt of each payment from or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any
Obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries hereunder, it shall distribute such payment to the
Lenders (other than any Lender that has expressly waived its right to receive its pro
rata share thereof) pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of
the Obligations with respect to which such payment was received.




(b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any amount hereunder (whether by
voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or banker’s
lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents,
or otherwise) which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Loans, of
a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received by other Lenders is in a greater
proportion than the total of such Obligation then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of
such Obligation then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such receipt, then
such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from
the other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
respectively, to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all
of the Lenders in such amount, provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is
thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.




(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of the preceding
Sections 13.06(a) and (b) shall be subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which
require, or permit, differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to
Defaulting Lenders.



















13.07 Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial statements to be furnished to the
Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
throughout the periods involved (except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed
in writing by Parent to the Lenders), provided that (x) except all computations determining
compliance with Section 9, including definitions used therein, shall utilize accounting principles
and policies in effect at the time of the preparation of, and in conformity with those used to
prepare, the December 31, 2004 historical financial statements of the Borrower delivered to the
Lenders pursuant to Section 7.10(b), and (y) if at any time the computations determining compliance
with Section 9 utilize accounting principles different from those utilized in such financial
statements furnished to the Lenders, such financial statements shall be accompanied by
reconciliation worksheets.




(b) All computations of interest relating to Eurodollar Loans shall be made on the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. All other computations of interest hereunder shall
be made on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 days.




13.08 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) This
Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder
and thereunder shall be construed in accordance with and be governed by the law of the state of New
York. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or any other Credit Document
may be brought in the courts of the state of New York or of the United States for the Southern
District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Credit Party party
hereto hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each Credit Party further
irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such
action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage
prepaid, to such Credit Party located outside New York City and by hand delivery to such Credit
Party located within New York City, at its address for notices pursuant to Section 13.03, such
service to become effective 30 days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of
the Administrative Agent, any Lender to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Credit Party in any other jurisdiction.




(b) Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in
clause (a) above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such
court that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.




(c) Each of the parties to this agreement hereby irrevocably waives all right to a trial by
jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this agreement, the
other credit documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.




13.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the



















same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent.




13.10 Reserved.




13.11 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several sections and subsections of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
construction of any provision of this Agreement.




13.12 Amendment or Waiver. (a) Neither this Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor
any terms hereof or thereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated unless such change,
waiver, discharge or termination is in writing signed by the Borrower, each of the Parent
Guarantors and the Required Lenders, provided that no such change, waiver, discharge or
termination shall, without the consent of each Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) affected
thereby, (i) extend the Maturity Date, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
(other than as a result of waiving the applicability of any post-default increase in interest
rates) thereon, or reduce the principal amount thereof, (ii) increase the Commitment of any Lender
over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event
of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not constitute a change in the
terms of any Commitment of any Lender), (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section,
(iv) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders or (v) consent to the
assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement.




(b) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination to any of the
provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by clauses (i) through (v), inclusive, of the first
proviso to Section 13.12(a), the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of one
or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then the Borrower shall
have the right to replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders (so long as all non-consenting
Lenders are so replaced) with one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13, so long as
at the time of such replacement, each such Replacement Lender consents to the proposed change,
waiver, discharge or termination, provided that the Borrower shall not have the right to replace a
Lender solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender’s rights (and the withholding of any
required consent by such Lender) pursuant to Section 13.12(a)(ii).




13.13 Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including, without limitation, in Section
1.10, 1.11, 4.04, 12.07 or 13.01 shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
making and repayment of the Loans.




13.14 Domicile of Loans. Each Lender may transfer and carry its Loans at, to or for the
account of any branch office, subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender, provided that the
Borrower shall not be responsible for costs arising under Section 1.10 or 4.04 resulting from any
such transfer (other than a transfer pursuant to Section 1.12(a)) to the extent not otherwise
applicable to such Lender prior to such transfer.




13.15 Confidentiality. Subject to Section 13.04, the Lenders shall hold all non-public
information obtained pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement in accordance



















with its customary procedure for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance
with safe and sound banking practices and in any event may make disclosure reasonably required by
any bona fide transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated
transfer of any Loans or participation therein (so long as such transferee or participant agrees in
writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 13.15) or as required or requested by any
governmental agency or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process, provided that,
unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender shall notify the
Borrower of any request by any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such
request in connection with an examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such
governmental agency) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such
information, and provided further that in no event shall any Lender be obligated or required to
return any materials furnished by Parent or any Subsidiary.




13.16 Registry. The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the
Borrower’s agent, solely for purposes of this Section 13.16, to maintain a register (the
“Register”) on which it will record the Commitments from time to time of each of the Lenders, the
Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the
Loans of each Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation shall
not affect the Borrower’s obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to any Lender, the
transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any
Loan made pursuant to such Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on
the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitments
and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such
Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or
transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent
on the Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and
delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section 13.04(b). Coincident with the
delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance
and registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note evidencing such Loan, and
thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the
assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new Lender.




SECTION 14. Parent Guaranty.




14.01 Guaranty. In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to
extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by each Parent
Guarantor from the proceeds of the Loans, each Parent Guarantor hereby agrees with the Lenders as
follows: each Parent Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary
obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity,
acceleration or otherwise, of any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed
Creditors. If any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors becomes due and
payable hereunder, each Parent Guarantor unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the
Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, together with any and all expenses which may be incurred
by the Guaranteed Creditors in collecting any of the Guaranteed Obligations. This Parent Guaranty
is a continuing one and all liabilities to which it applies or



















may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in a
reliance hereon. If claim is ever made upon any Guaranteed Creditor for repayment or recovery of
any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and
any of the aforesaid payees repays all or part of said amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree
or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such payee or any of its
property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such payee with any
such claimant (including the Borrower), then and in such event each Parent Guarantor agrees that
any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be binding upon such Parent
Guarantor, notwithstanding any revocation of this Parent Guaranty or any other instrument
evidencing any liability of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and each Parent Guarantor
shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered
to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any such payee.




14.02 Bankruptcy. Additionally, each Parent Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees the payment of any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors
whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in
Section 10.05, and unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Guaranteed Creditors,
or order, on demand.




14.03 Nature of Liability. The liability of each Parent Guarantor hereunder is
exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations
whether executed by either Parent Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and the
liability of each Parent Guarantor hereunder is not affected or impaired by (a) any direction as to
application of payment by the Borrower or by any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other
guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the
Guaranteed Obligations, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or
undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by
the Borrower or (e) any payment made to the Guaranteed Creditors on the Guaranteed Obligations
which any such Guaranteed Creditor repays to the Borrower pursuant to court order in any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each
Parent Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by
reason of any such proceeding.




14.04 Independent Obligation. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all
or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor shall affect, impair or be a
defense to this Parent Guaranty, and this Parent Guaranty shall be primary, absolute and
unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the existence of any other
circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor except
payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Parent Guarantor hereunder
are independent of the obligations of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other Person, and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against either Parent Guarantor whether or
not action is brought against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other Person and whether or
not the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other Person be joined in any such action or actions.
Each Parent Guarantor waives, to the full extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of
limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any



















payment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of
limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to each Parent
Guarantor.




14.05 Authorization. Each Parent Guarantor authorizes the Guaranteed Creditors
without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived),
and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to:





(a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time
of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Guaranteed Obligations
(including any increase or decrease in the rate of interest thereon), any security therefor,
or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this Parent
Guaranty made shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or
altered;




(b) take and hold security for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations and sell,
exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any
order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever
securing, the Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder)
incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset
thereagainst;




(c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Borrower or others or
otherwise act or refrain from acting;




(d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, the Borrower or other
obligors;




(e) settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any security therefor or
any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect
thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment
of any liability (whether due or not) of the Borrower to its creditors other than the
Guaranteed Creditors;




(f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or
liabilities of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or
liabilities of the Borrower remain unpaid;




(g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, this
Agreement, any other Credit Document or any of the instruments or agreements referred to
herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement any Credit Document (other than
this Agreement) or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or




(h) take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable principles of common
law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of either Parent Guarantor from its
liabilities under this Parent Guaranty.



14.06 Reliance. It is not necessary for the Guaranteed Creditors to inquire into the
capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or



















purporting to act on its behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance
upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.




14.07 Subordination. Any of the indebtedness of the Borrower now or hereafter owing
to either Parent Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower
owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an
Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of the Borrower to such Parent Guarantor shall be
collected, enforced and received by such Parent Guarantor for the benefit of the Guaranteed
Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on
account of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without
affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Parent Guarantor under the other
provisions of this Parent Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by a Parent Guarantor of any note or
negotiable instrument evidencing any of the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Parent Guarantor,
such Parent Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is
subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Parent
Guarantor hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of
subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Parent Guaranty (whether
contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Guaranteed
Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.




14.08 Waiver. (a) Each Parent Guarantor waives any right (except as shall be
required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i)
proceed against the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or
exhaust any security held from the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue
any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor’s power whatsoever. Each Parent Guarantor waives any
defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other
party, other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, based on or arising out of the
disability of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed
Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or any
other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect
of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable
law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against the Borrower
or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of
either Parent Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid.
Each Parent Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed
Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or
subrogation or other right or remedy of such Parent Guarantor against the Borrower or any other
party or any security.




(b) Each Parent Guarantor waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and
notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of
dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Parent Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or
incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations. Each Parent Guarantor assumes all
responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower’s financial



















condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of
the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which each Parent
Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Guaranteed Creditors shall have no duty
to advise either Parent Guarantor of information known to them regarding such circumstances or
risks.




(c) Until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash or Cash
Equivalents, each Parent Guarantor hereby waives all rights of subrogation which it may at any time
otherwise have as a result of this Parent Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the
Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Guaranteed Creditors against the Borrower or
any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and all contractual, statutory or common law
rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from the Borrower or any other guarantor which
it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Parent Guaranty.




14.09 Payment. All payments made by either Parent Guarantor pursuant to this Section
14 will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the
provisions of Sections 4.03 and 4.04.

be set out in such written confirmation. If all conditions precedent to such
Loan have been met Lender will on the date requested promptly remit to Borrower
the amount of such Loan in immediately available dollars, by crediting the
Funding Account with immediately available funds as the amount of such Loan.

Section 2.4 Fees.

(a) In consideration of Borrower's commitment to make the Loans,
Borrower will pay to Lender a non-refundable commitment fee determined on a
daily basis by applying a rate of ten basis points (0.10%) per annum to the

Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and to
continue Eurodollar Loans beyond the expiration of such Interest Period by
designating a new Interest Period to take effect at the time of such expiration.
In making such elections, Borrower may combine existing Loans made pursuant to
separate Borrowings into one new Borrowing or divide existing Loans made

required to be set out in such written confirmation. Each

Eurodollar Loans. If (due to the existence of a Default or for any other reason)
Borrower fails to timely and properly give any Continuation/Conversion Notice
with respect to a Borrowing of existing Eurodollar Loans at least three days
prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, such Eurodollar
Loans shall automatically be converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of such
Interest Period. No new funds shall be repaid by Borrower or advanced by Lender
in connection with any Continuation or Conversion of existing Loans pursuant to
this section, and no such Continuation or Conversion shall be deemed to be a new
advance of funds for any purpose; such Continuations and Conversions merely
constitute a change in the interest rate applicable to already outstanding
Loans.

all payments of principal, including any principal payment made with proceeds of
Mortgage Collateral, and fees hereunder shall be made directly to Lender in

Borrower shall send notice to Lender before 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on
the day any payment of principal or interest is received by Lender which sets
forth the Loans against which such payment is to be applied. Any payment (or any
payment received without a notice



19
<PAGE>

regarding application of such payment) received by Lender after such time will
be deemed to have been made on the next following Business Day. Should any such
payment become due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity
of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in
the case of a payment of principal or past due interest, interest shall accrue
and be payable thereon for the period of such extension as provided in the Loan
Document under which such payment is due. Each payment under a Loan Document
shall be payable at the place provided therein and, if no specific place of
payment is provided, shall be payable at the place of payment of the Note. When
Lender collects or receives money on account of the Obligations, Lender shall
apply all such money so distributed, as follows:

(a) first, for the payment of all Obligations which are then
due, and if such money is insufficient to pay all such Obligations, (i)
first to any reimbursements due Lender under Section 5.5, (ii) second,
to the payment of the Loans then due, and (iii) then to the partial
payment of all other Obligations then due in proportion to the amounts
thereof, or as Lender shall otherwise agree;

(b) then for the prepayment of amounts owing under the Loan
Documents if so specified by Borrower;

(c) then for the prepayment of principal on the Note, together
with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal so prepaid; and

(d) last, for the payment or prepayment of any other
Obligations.

All payments applied to principal or interest on any Note shall be applied first
to any interest then due and payable, then to principal then due and payable,
and last to any prepayment of principal and interest.

Section 2.8 Increased Cost and Reduced Return.

(a) If, after the date hereof, there shall occur any change in any
applicable Law, rule, or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank, or

compliance by Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or
directive issued after the date hereof (whether or not having the force of Law)
of any such governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

(i) shall subject Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) to
any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Eurodollar Loans,
any Note, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or change the
basis of taxation of any amounts payable to Lender (or its Applicable
Lending Office) under this Agreement or any Note in respect of any
Eurodollar Loans (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of
Lender by the jurisdiction in which Lender has its principal office or
such Applicable Lending Office);



20
<PAGE>


(ii) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than the
Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination of the Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets
of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office), including the commitment of Lender
hereunder; or

(iii) shall impose on Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting
this Agreement or any Notes or any of such extensions of credit or
liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender (or its
Applicable Lending Office) of making, converting into, continuing, or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or its Notes with
respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then Borrower shall pay to Lender within
fifteen (15) days after demand by Lender, such amount or amounts as will
compensate Lender for such increased cost or reduction. If Lender requests
compensation by Borrower under this Section 2.8(a), Borrower may, by notice to
Lender, suspend the obligation of Lender to make or continue Loans of the Type
with respect to which such compensation is requested, or to convert Loans of any
other Type into Loans of such Type, until the event or condition giving rise to
such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section
2.11 shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the
right of Lender to receive the compensation so requested.

(b) If, after the date hereof, Lender shall have determined that the
adoption of any applicable Law, rule, or regulation regarding capital adequacy
or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such
governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency, has or would have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of Lender or any
corporation controlling Lender, due to the obligations of Lender hereunder, to a
level below that which Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for
such adoption, change, request, or directive (taking into consideration its
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, within fifteen (15) days after
demand by Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate Lender for such reduction, but only to the extent that Lender
has not been compensated therefor by any increase in the Adjusted Eurodollar
Rate.

(c) Lender shall promptly notify Borrower of any event of which it has
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to it. In the event that Lender claims compensation under this
Section, Lender shall furnish to Borrower a statement setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In



21
<PAGE>

determining such amount, Lender shall act in good faith and may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

Section 2.9 Limitation on Types of Loans. If on or prior to the first
day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan:

(a) Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that by
reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, as the case may be, for
such Interest Period; or

(b) Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that
the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
Lender of funding Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then Lender shall give Borrower prompt notice thereof specifying the relevant
amounts or periods, and so long as such condition remains in effect, Lender
shall be under no obligation to make additional Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans
or convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans, and Borrower shall, on the
last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, either prepay such Loans or convert such Loans into Base Rate
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.10 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for Lender or its Applicable
Lending Office to make, maintain, or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then
Lender shall promptly notify Borrower thereof and Lender's obligation to make or
continue Eurodollar Loans and to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended until such time as Lender may again make, maintain, and fund
Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 1.4 shall be
applicable).

Section 2.11 Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation of Lender
to make a particular Type of Loan or to continue, or to convert Loans of any
other Type into, Loans of a particular Type shall be suspended pursuant to
Sections 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10 hereof (Loans of such Type being herein called
"Affected Loans" and such Type being herein called the "Affected Type"),
Lender's Affected Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on
the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for Affected Loans (or,
in the case of a Conversion required by Section 2.6 hereof, on such earlier date
as Lender may specify to Borrower) and, unless and until Lender gives notice as
provided below that the circumstances specified in Sections 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10
hereof that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

(a) to the extent that Lender's Affected Loans have been so
converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would
otherwise be applied to Lender's Affected Loans shall be applied
instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

(b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued by
Lender as Loans of the Affected Type shall be made or continued instead
as Base Rate Loans, and all



22
<PAGE>

Loans of Lender that would otherwise be converted into Loans of the
Affected Type shall be converted instead into (or shall remain as) Base
Rate Loans.

Section 2.12 Compensation. Upon the request of Lender, Borrower shall
pay to Lender such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable
opinion of Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense (including
loss of anticipated profits) incurred by it as a result of:

(a) any payment, prepayment, or Conversion of a Eurodollar
Loan for any reason (including, without limitation, the acceleration of
the Loans pursuant to Section 7.2) on a date other than the last day of
the Interest Period for such Loan; or

(b) any failure by Borrower for any reason (including, without
limitation, the failure of any condition precedent specified in Article
IV hereof to be satisfied) to borrow, convert, continue, or prepay a
Eurodollar Loan on the date for such borrowing, Conversion,
Continuation, or prepayment specified in the relevant notice of
borrowing, prepayment, Continuation, or Conversion under this
Agreement.

Section 2.13 Taxes.

(a) Any and all payments by Borrower to or for the account of Lender
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect
thereto, excluding, taxes imposed on Lender's income, and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the Laws of which Lender (or its
Applicable Lending Office) is organized or any political subdivision thereof
(all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If
Borrower shall be required by Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any
sum payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to Lender, (a) the
sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this section) Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (b) Borrower shall make such deductions, and
(c) Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Law.

(b) In addition, Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future
stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (hereinafter referred to
as "Other Taxes").

(c) Borrower agrees to indemnify Lender for the full amount of Taxes
and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section) paid by
Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest, and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto.



23
<PAGE>

(d) If Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the
account of Lender pursuant to this Section, then Lender will agree to use
reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office
so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter
accrue if such change, in the judgment of Lender, is not otherwise
disadvantageous to Lender and in the event Lender is reimbursed for an amount
paid by Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.7, it shall promptly return such
amount to Borrower.

(e) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of Taxes,
Borrower shall furnish to Lender the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing such payment.

(f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of Borrower contained in this
section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment in full
of the Notes.

Related Person in any jurisdiction have been filed and all taxes, assessments,

warranties by Borrower herein shall survive delivery of the Note and the funding

Loan to Lender free and clear of any other Lien;

judicial foreclosure;

Related Person's business, the officers and managers of each Related Person
consider the effect of Environmental Laws on the business of such Related
Person, in the course of which they identify and evaluate potential risks and

endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of any
Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever be
required to pay interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be
lawfully charged under applicable Law from time to time in effect, and the
provisions of this section shall control over all other provisions of the Loan
Documents which may be in conflict or apparent conflict herewith. Lender
expressly disavows any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned
interest or finance charges in the event the maturity of any Obligation is
accelerated. If (a) the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated for any
reason, (b) any Obligation is prepaid and as a result any amounts held to
constitute interest are determined to be in excess of the legal maximum, or (c)
Lender or any other holder of any or all of the Obligations shall otherwise
collect moneys which are determined to constitute interest which would otherwise
increase the interest on any or all of the Obligations to an amount in excess of
that permitted to be charged by applicable Law then in effect, then all such
sums determined to constitute interest in excess of such legal limit shall,
without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce the then outstanding principal of
the related Obligations or, at Lender's or such holder's option, promptly
returned to each Related Person or the other payor thereof upon such

determination. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under
any specific circumstance, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under applicable
Law, Lender and each Related Persons (and any other payors thereof) shall to the
greatest extent permitted under applicable Law, (i) characterize any
non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest,
(ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize,
prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire
contemplated term of the instruments evidencing the Obligations in accordance
with the amounts outstanding from time to time thereunder and the maximum legal
rate of interest from time to time in effect under applicable Law in order to
lawfully charge the maximum amount of interest permitted under applicable Law.
In the event applicable Law provides for an interest ceiling under Section 303
of the Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly ceiling.

Section 10.10 Bank Accounts; Offset. To secure the repayment of the
Obligations each Related Person hereby grants to Lender and to each financial
institution which hereafter acquires a participation or other interest in the
Loans or Note (in this section called a "Participant") a security interest, a
lien, and a right of offset, each of which shall be in addition to all other
interests, liens, and rights of Lender or any Participant at common law, under
the Loan Documents, or otherwise, and each of which shall be upon and against
(a) any and all moneys, securities or other property (and the proceeds
therefrom) of any Related Person now or hereafter held or received by or in
transit to Lender, any Lender or Participant from or for the account any Related
Person, whether for safekeeping, custody pledge, transmission, collection or
otherwise, (b) any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) of any Related Person with Lender or any Participant, and
(c) any other credits and claims of any Related Person at any time existing
against Lender, any Lender or Participant, including claims under certificates
of deposit. Upon the occurrence of any Default, each of Lender and Participants
is hereby authorized to foreclose upon, offset, appropriate, and apply, at any
time and from time to time, without notice to Borrower, any and all items
hereinabove referred to against the Obligations then due and payable.

Section 10.11 Assignments, Participations.

(a) Assignments. Lender shall have the right to sell, assign or
transfer all or any part of Note, Loans and rights and the associated rights and
obligations under all Loan Documents to one or more financial institutions, with
minimum assets of $5,000,000,000, and the assignee, transferee or recipient
shall have, to the extent of such sale, assignment, or transfer, the same
rights, benefits and obligations of Lender. Within five (5) Business Days after
any such assignment, the assignee shall notify Borrower of the outstanding
principal balance of the Note payable to assignee and Borrower shall execute and
deliver to assignee a new Note evidencing such assignee's assigned Loans and, if
the assignor Lender has retained a portion of its Loans, replacement Note in the
principal amount of the Loans retained by the assignor Lender (such Note to be
in exchange for, but not in payment of, the Note held by such Lender).

(b) Participations. Lender shall have the right to grant participations
in all or any part of the Note, Loans and the associated rights and obligations
under all Loan Documents to one or more financial institutions with minimum

Section 10.16 Termination; Limited Survival. In its sole and absolute
discretion Borrower may at any time that no Obligations are owing elect in a

Loan Documents shall thereupon be terminated and the parties thereto released

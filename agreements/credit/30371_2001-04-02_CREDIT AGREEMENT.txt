required to be delivered hereunder shall be prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time, applied
on a basis consistent (except for changes concurred in by the Borrower's
independent public accountants) with the most recent audited consolidated
financial statements of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries delivered
to the Banks.

SECTION 1.03. Types and Classes of Borrowings. The term "Borrowing" denotes
the aggregation of Loans of one or more Banks to be made to the Borrower
pursuant to Article 2 on a single date and for a single Interest Period.
Borrowings are classified for purposes of this Agreement either by reference to
the pricing of Loans comprising such Borrowing (e.g., a "Fixed Rate Borrowing"
is a Euro-Dollar Borrowing or a Bid Rate Borrowing (excluding any such Borrowing
consisting of Bid Rate (Indexed) Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate), and a
"Euro-Dollar Borrowing" is a Borrowing comprised of Euro- Dollar Loans) or by
reference to the provisions of Article 2 under which participation therein is
determined (i.e., a "Committed Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.01 in
which all Banks participate in proportion to their Commitments, while a "Bid
Rate Borrowing" is a Borrowing under Section 2.03 in which the Bank participants
are determined on the basis of their bids in accordance therewith) or by
reference to the Class of Loans comprising such Borrowing (e.g. a "Term
Borrowing" is a Borrowing comprised of Term Loans).

ARTICLE 2

The Credits

SECTION 2.01. Commitments to Lend. (a) Revolving Credit Loans. During its
Revolving Credit Period, each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, to make loans to the Borrower pursuant to this
subsection from time to time in amounts such that the aggregate principal amount
of Revolving Credit Loans by such Bank at any one time outstanding shall not
exceed the amount of its Commitment. Each Borrowing under this subsection shall
be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or any larger multiple of
$1,000,000 (except that any such Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount
available in accordance with Section 3.02(b)) and shall be made from the several
Banks ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments in effect on the
date of Borrowing; provided that, if the Interest Period selected by the
Borrower for a Borrowing would otherwise end after the Commitment Termination
Dates of some but not all Banks, the Borrower may in its Notice of Committed
Borrowing elect not to borrow from those Banks whose Commitment Termination
Dates fall prior to the end of such Interest Period. Within the foregoing
limits, the Borrower may borrow under this subsection (a), or to the

11
<PAGE>

extent permitted by Section 2.12, prepay Loans and reborrow at any time during
the Revolving Credit Periods under this subsection (a).

(b) Term Loans. Each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, to make a loan to the Borrower on its Commitment
Termination Date in an amount up to but not exceeding the amount of its
Commitment. Each Borrowing under this subsection (b) shall be made from the
several Banks having the same Commitment Termination Date ratably in proportion
to their respective Commitments.

(c) Extension of Commitments. On no more than two separate occasions, the
Borrower may, upon not less than 45 days but no earlier than 60 days notice
prior to the then current Commitment Termination Dates to the Administrative
Agent (which shall notify each Bank of receipt of such request), propose to
extend the Revolving Credit Periods for an additional 364 days measured from the
Commitment Termination Dates then in effect. Each Bank shall endeavor to respond
to such request, whether affirmatively or negatively (such determination in the
sole discretion of such Bank), by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent not more than 45 days nor less than 30 days prior to such Bank's
Commitment Termination Date. Subject to the execution by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and such Banks of a duly completed Extension Agreement in
substantially the form of Exhibit H, the Commitment Termination Date applicable
to the Commitment of each Bank so affirmatively notifying the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall be extended for the period specified above; provided
that no Commitment Termination Date of any Bank shall be extended unless Banks
having at least 662/3% in aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect at the
time any such extension is requested shall have elected so to extend their
Commitments. Any Bank which does not give such notice to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have elected not to extend as requested,
and the Commitment of each non-extending Bank shall terminate on its Commitment
Termination Date determined without giving effect to such requested extension.
The Borrower may, in accordance with Section 8.06, designate another bank or
other financial institution (which may be, but need not be, an extending Bank)
to replace a non-extending Bank.

SECTION 2.02. Notice of Committed Borrowings. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent notice (a "Notice of Committed Borrowing") not later than
10:30 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the date of each Base Rate Borrowing and
(y) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before each Euro-Dollar Borrowing,
specifying:

12
<PAGE>

(a)  the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Domestic Business Day in
the case of a Domestic Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a
Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

(b)  the aggregate amount of such Borrowing,

(c)  whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to bear interest
initially at the Base Rate or a Euro-Dollar Rate,

(d)  the Class of Loans comprising such Borrowing, and

(e)  in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the duration of the
initial Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the
definition of Interest Period.

SECTION 2.03. Bid Rate Borrowings. (a) The Bid Rate Option. In addition to
Committed Borrowings pursuant to Section 2.01, the Borrower may, as set forth in
this Section, request the Banks at any time prior to their respective Commitment
Termination Dates to make offers to make Bid Rate Loans to the Borrower. The
Banks may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the Borrower
may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set
forth in this Section.

(b) Bid Rate Quote Request. When the Borrower wishes to request offers
to make Bid Rate Loans under this Section, it shall transmit to the
Administrative Agent by telex or facsimile transmission a Bid Rate Quote Request
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto so as to be received no later than
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the fourth Euro-Dollar Business Day prior
to the date of Borrowing proposed therein, in the case of a Bid Rate (Indexed)
Auction or (y) the Domestic Business Day next preceding the date of Borrowing
proposed therein, in the case of a Bid Rate (General) Auction (or, in either
case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall
have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the
date of the Bid Rate Quote Request for the first Bid Rate (Indexed) Auction or
Bid Rate (General) Auction for which such change is to be effective) specifying:

(i)   the proposed date of Borrowing, which shall be a Euro-Dollar
Business Day,

(ii)  the aggregate amount of such Borrowing, which shall be
$10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000,

(iii) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject

13
<PAGE>

(iv)  whether the Bid Rate Quotes requested are to set forth a Bid
Rate (Indexed) or a Bid Rate (General) Rate.

The Borrower may request offers to make Bid Rate Loans for more than one
Interest Period in a single Bid Rate Quote Request.

(c)   Invitation for Bid Rate Quotes. Promptly upon receipt of a Bid
Rate Quote Request, the Administrative Agent shall send to the Banks by telex or
facsimile transmission an Invitation for Bid Rate Quotes substantially in the
form of Exhibit C hereto, which shall constitute an invitation by the Borrower
to each Bank to submit Bid Rate Quotes offering to make the Bid Rate Loans to
which such Bid Rate Quote Request relates in accordance with this Section.

(d)   Submission and Contents of Bid Rate Quotes. (i) Each Bank may
submit a Bid Rate Quote containing an offer or offers to make Bid Rate Loans in
response to any Invitation for Bid Rate Quotes. Each Bid Rate Quote must comply
with the requirements of this subsection (d) and must be submitted to the
Administrative Agent by telex or facsimile transmission at its offices specified

Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the
Banks not later than the date of the Bid Rate Quote Request for the first Bid
Rate (Indexed) Auction or Bid Rate (General) Auction for which such change is to
be effective); provided that Bid Rate Quotes submitted by the Administrative
Agent (or any affiliate of the Administrative Agent) in the capacity of a Bank
may be submitted, and may only be submitted, if the Administrative Agent or such
affiliate notifies the Borrower of the terms of the offer or offers contained
therein not later than (x) 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the fourth
Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of
a Bid Rate (Indexed) Auction or (y) 9:15 A.M. (New York City time) on the
proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Bid Rate (General) Auctions.
Subject to Articles 3 and 6, any Bid Rate Quote so made shall be irrevocable
except with the written consent of the Administrative Agent given on the
instructions of the Borrower.

(ii)  Each Bid Rate Quote shall be in substantially the form of
Exhibit D hereto and shall in any case specify:

(A)  the proposed date of Borrowing,

14
<PAGE>

(B)  the principal amount of the Bid Rate Loan for which
each such offer is being made, which principal amount (w) may be
greater than or less than the Commitment of the quoting Bank,
(x) must be $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000 and
(y) may not exceed the principal amount of Bid Rate Loans for
each Interest Period for which offers were requested and (z) may
be subject to an aggregate limitation as to the principal amount
of Bid Rate Loans for which offers being made by such quoting
Bank may be accepted,

(C)  in the case of a Bid Rate (Indexed) Auction, the
margin above or below the applicable London Interbank Offered
Rate (the "Bid Rate (Indexed) Margin") offered for each such Bid
Rate Loan, expressed as a percentage (specified to the nearest
1/10,000th of 1%) to be added to or subtracted from such base
rate,

(D)  in the case of a Bid Rate (General)Auction, the rate
of interest per annum (specified to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%)
(the "Bid Rate (General)") offered for each such Bid Rate Loan,
and

(E)  the identity of the quoting Bank.

A Bid Rate Quote may set forth up to five separate offers by the quoting Bank
with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation for Bid
Rate Quotes.

(iii) Any Bid Rate Quote shall be disregarded if:

(A)  it is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D
hereto or does not specify all of the information required by
subsection 2.03(d)(ii);

(B)  it contains qualifying, conditional or similar
language beyond that contemplated by Exhibit D;

(C)  it proposes terms other than or in addition to those
set forth in the applicable Invitation for Bid Rate Quotes;

(D)  it arrives after the time set forth in subsection

15
<PAGE>

(e)  Notice to Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall promptly but in
no event later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar
Business Day prior to the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a Bid Rate
(Indexed) Auction or (y) the proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a Bid
Rate (General) Auction (or, in either case, such other time or date as the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have
notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Bid Rate Quote Request for
the first Bid Rate (Indexed) Auction or Bid Rate (General) Auction for which
such change is to be effective), notify the Borrower of the terms (x) of any Bid
Rate Quote submitted by a Bank that is in accordance with subsection (d) and (y)
of any Bid Rate Quote that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a
previous Bid Rate Quote submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Bid Rate
Quote Request. Any such subsequent Quote shall be disregarded by the
Administrative Agent unless such subsequent Quote is submitted solely to correct
a manifest error in such former Quote. The Administrative Agent's notice to the
Borrower shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of Loans for which
offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Bid
Rate Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Bid Rate (Indexed)
Margins or Bid Rate (General) Rates, as the case may be, so offered and (C) if
applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Bid Rate Loans for
which offers in any single Bid Rate Quote may be accepted.

(f)  Acceptance and Notice by Borrower. Not later than 10:30 A.M. (New
York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed
date of Borrowing, in the case of a Bid Rate (Indexed) Auction or (y) the
proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a Bid Rate (General) Auction (or, in
either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent shall have mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later
than the date of the Bid Rate Quote Request for the first Bid Rate (Indexed)
Auction or Bid Rate (General) Auction for which such change is to be effective),
the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of its acceptance or non-
acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to subsection (e). In the
case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Bid Rate Borrowing") shall specify
the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are
accepted. The Borrower may accept any Bid Rate Quote in whole or in part;
provided that:

(i)  the aggregate principal amount of each Bid Rate Borrowing may not
exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Bid Rate Quote
Request,

(ii) the principal amount of each Bid Rate Borrowing must be
$10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, and

16
<PAGE>

(iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending
Bid Rate (Indexed) Margins or Bid Rate (General) Rates, as the case may be.

(g)  Allocation by Administrative Agent. If offers are made by two more
Banks with the same Bid Rate (Indexed) Margins or Bid Rate (General), as the
case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect
of which such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal
amount of Bid Rate Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be
allocated by the Administrative Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in
multiples of $1,000,000, as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate) in
proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by
the Administrative Agent of the amounts of Bid Rate Loans shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error.

SECTION 2.04. Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans. (a) Upon receipt of a
Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of
the contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such Borrowing and
such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

(b)  Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of each
Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall (except as provided in
subsection (c) of this Section) make available its share of such Borrowing, in
Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the
Administrative Agent at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01.
Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition
specified in Article 3 has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will
make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower at the
Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.

(c)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Bank
prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available to the
Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection
(b) of this Section 2.04 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.
If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such share available
to the Administrative Agent, such Bank and, if such Bank shall not have made
such payment within two Domestic Business Days of demand therefor, the Borrower
severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the

17
<PAGE>

Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the
interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 2.07 and (ii) in the case
of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

(d)  The failure of any Bank to make the Loan to be made by it as part of
any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any,
hereunder to make a Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Bank shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such
other Bank.

SECTION 2.05. Registry; Notes. (a) The Administrative Agent shall maintain
a register (the "Register") on which it will record the Commitment of each Bank,
each Loan made by such Bank and each repayment of any Loan made by such Bank.
Any such recordation by the Administrative Agent on the Register shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error. Failure to make any such recordation, or any
error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrower's obligations
hereunder.

(b)  The Borrower hereby agrees that, promptly upon the request of any Bank
at any time, the Borrower shall deliver to such Bank a duly executed Note, in
substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, payable to the order of such Bank
and representing the obligation of the Borrower to pay the unpaid principal
amount of the Loans made to the Borrower by such Bank, with interest as provided
herein on the unpaid principal amount from time to time outstanding.

(c)  Each Bank shall record the date, amount and maturity of each Loan made
by it and the date and amount of each payment of principal made by the Borrower
with respect thereto, and each Bank receiving a Note pursuant to this Section,
if such Bank so elects in connection with any transfer or enforcement of its
Note, may endorse on the schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations
to evidence the foregoing information with respect to each such Loan then
outstanding; provided that the failure of such Bank to make any such recordation
or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or
under the Notes. Such Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so
to endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of its Note a continuation
of any such schedule as and when required.

SECTION 2.06. Maturity of Loans. (a) Each Revolving Credit Loan made by any
Bank shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable
together with accrued interest thereon, on the Commitment Termination Date of
such Bank.

18
<PAGE>

(b)  The Term Loans of each Bank shall mature, and the principal amount
thereof shall be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon, on the
Final Maturity Date of such Bank.

(c)  Each Bid Rate Loan included in any Bid Rate Borrowing shall mature,
and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable (together with
interest accrued thereon), on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to
such Bid Rate Borrowing.

SECTION 2.07. Interest Rates. (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest
on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such
Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
for such day. Such interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each
Quarterly Payment Date, at maturity and on the date of termination of the
Commitments in their entirety. Any overdue principal of or overdue interest on
any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until
paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such day.

(b)  Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day during each Interest Period applicable thereto, at
a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus
the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Interest Period. Such
interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and,
if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three
months after the first day thereof.

The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means
the rate appearing on Page 3750 of the Telerate Service (or on any successor or
substitute page of such service, or any successor to or substitute for such
service, providing rate quotations comparable to those currently provided on
such page of the Telerate Service, as may be nominated by the British Bankers'
Association for purposes of providing quotations of interest rates applicable to
dollar deposits in the London interbank market) as of 11:00 A.M. (London time)
two Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the commencement of such Interest Period,
as the rate for dollar deposits with a maturity comparable to such Interest
Period. In the event that such rate is not so available at such time for any
reason, then the "London Interbank Offered Rate" for such Interest Period shall
be the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%) of
the respective rates per annum at which deposits in dollars are offered to each
of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London interbank market at
approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two Euro-Dollar Business Days before the
first day of such Interest Period in an amount approximately equal to the
principal amount of the Loan of such Euro-Dollar Reference Bank to which such
Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time comparable to such Interest
Period. If any Euro-

19
<PAGE>

Dollar Reference Bank does not furnish a timely quotation, the Administrative
Agent shall determine the relevant interest rate on the basis of the quotation
furnished by the remaining Euro-Dollar Reference Bank or, if none of such
quotations is available on a timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall
apply.

(c)  Any overdue principal of or overdue interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan
shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day from and including the date
payment thereof was due to but excluding the date of actual payment, at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus higher of (i) the sum of the Euro-Dollar
Margin for such day plus the London Interbank Offerred Rate applicable to such
Loan at the date such payment was due and (ii) the Base Rate for such day.

(d)  Subject to Section 8.01(a), each Bid Rate (Indexed) Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period
applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London Interbank
Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with Section
2.07(b) as if each Euro-Dollar Reference Bank were to participate in the related
Bid Rate (Indexed) Borrowing ratably in proportion to its Commitment) plus (or
minus) the Bid Rate (Indexed) Margin quoted by the Bank making such Loan in
accordance with Section 2.03. Each Bid Rate (General) Loan shall bear interest
on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Bid Rate (General) quoted by the Bank
making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Such interest shall be payable
for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is
longer than three months, at intervals of three months after the first day
thereof. Any overdue principal of or overdue interest on any Bid Rate Loan shall
bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such day.

(e)  The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable
to the Loans hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Borrower and the participating Banks by telecopy, telex or cable of each rate of
interest so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error unless the Borrower raises an objection thereto within
five Domestic Business Days after receipt of such notice.

SECTION 2.08. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee at the Facility
Fee Rate (determined daily in accordance with the Pricing Schedule). Such
facility fee shall accrue (i) from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding such Bank's Commitment Termination Date, on the daily average
aggregate amount of such Bank's Commitment (whether used or unused) and (ii)
from and

20
<PAGE>

including such Bank's Commitment Termination Date to but excluding the date such
Bank's Loans shall be repaid in their entirety, on the daily average aggregate
outstanding principal amount of such Bank's Committed Loans.

(b)  Payments. Accrued fees under this Section for the account of any Bank
shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and upon
such Bank's Commitment Termination Date and Final Maturity Date (and, if later,
the date the Loans of such Bank shall be repaid in their entirety); provided,
that accrued facility fees shall be paid in equal quarterly installments on the
Quarterly Payment Date following each full quarter during which the aggregate
amount of Commitments remains unchanged.

SECTION 2.09. Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The
Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are
outstanding at such time or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time by an
aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000 the
aggregate amount of the Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Credit and Bid Rate Loans.

SECTION 2.10. Method of Electing Interest Rates. (a) The Loans included in
each Committed Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate
specified by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of Committed Borrowing.
Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the
type of interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject in each case to the
provisions of Article 8 and the last sentence of this subsection (a)), as
follows:

(i)  if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the Borrower may elect to
convert such Loans to Euro-Dollar Loans as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day;
and

(ii) if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower may elect to
convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans or elect to continue such Loans as
Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period, subject to Section
2.14 in the case of any such conversion or continuation effective on any
day other than the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable
to such Loans.

Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a "Notice of Interest
Rate Election") to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York
City time) on the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before the conversion or
continuation selected in such notice is to be effective. A Notice of Interest
Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans, provided that (i) such portion
is allocated

21
<PAGE>

ratably among the Loans comprising such Group and (ii) the portion to which
such notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply,
are each $10,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000.

(b)  Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:

(i)   the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such
notice applies;

(ii)  the date on which the conversion or continuation
selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with
the applicable clause of subsection 2.10(a) above;

(iii) if the Loans comprising such Group are to be converted,
the new type of Loans and, if the Loans being converted are to be
Fixed Rate Loans, the duration of the next succeeding Interest Period
applicable thereto; and

(iv)  if such Loans are to be continued as Euro-Dollar Loans
for an additional Interest Period, the duration of such additional
Interest Period.

Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall
comply with the provisions of the definition of the term "Interest Period".

(c)  Promptly after receiving a Notice of Interest Rate Election from
the Borrower pursuant to subsection 2.10(a) above, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Bank of the contents thereof and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower. If no Notice of Interest Rate
Election is timely received prior to the end of an Interest Period for any
Group of Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected that such
Group of Loans be converted to Base Rate Loans as of the last day of such
Interest Period.

(d)  An election by the Borrower to change or continue the rate of
interest applicable to any Group of Loans pursuant to this Section shall
not constitute a "Borrowing" subject to the provisions of Section 3.02.

SECTION 2.11. Mandatory Termination of Commitments. The Commitment of
each Bank shall terminate on such Bank's Commitment Termination Date, and any
Revolving Credit or Bid Rate Loans of such Bank then outstanding (together with
accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.

SECTION 2.12. Optional Prepayments. (a) The Borrower may (i) upon
notice to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City

22
<PAGE>

time) on any Domestic Business Day prepay on such Domestic Business Day any
Group of Base Rate Loans or any Bid Rate Borrowing bearing interest at the Base
Rate pursuant to Section 8.01(a) and (ii) upon at least three Euro-Dollar
Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:30 A.M. (New
York City time) prepay any Group of Euro-Dollar Loans, in each case in whole at
any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating $5,000,000 or any
larger multiple of $1,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid
together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and together
with any additional amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14. Each such optional
prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks
included in such Group or Borrowing.

(b)  Except as provided in subsection 2.12(a), the Borrower may not prepay
all or any portion of the principal amount of any Bid Rate Loan prior to the
maturity thereof.

(c)  Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and
of such Bank's share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.13. General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall
make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees
hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due,
in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the
Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01. The
Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share of
each such payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Banks. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate
Loans, or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day,
the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic
Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-
Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the
date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar
Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar
month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding
Euro-Dollar Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on,
the Bid Rate Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business
Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-
Dollar Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by
operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such
extended time.

23
<PAGE>

(b)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder
that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative
Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount
equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower
shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at
the Federal Funds Rate.

SECTION 2.14. Funding Losses. If the Borrower makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan or any Euro-Dollar Loan is
converted to a Base Rate Loan or continued as a Euro-Dollar Loan for a new
Interest Period (pursuant to Article 2, 6 or 8 or otherwise) on any day other
than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower
fails to borrow, prepay, convert or continue any Fixed Rate Loans after notice
has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.04(a), 2.10(c) or
2.12(c), the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for
any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective
Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss
incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but
excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment or conversion or
failure to borrow, prepay, convert or continue, provided that such Bank shall
have delivered to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail
the calculation of the amount of such loss or expense, which certificate shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

SECTION 2.15. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the Prime
Rate and facility fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365
days (or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day); provided that facility
fees for the account of any Bank shall be paid in equal quarterly installments
for each full quarter in which the Commitment of such Bank remains unchanged.
All other interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day).

SECTION 2.16. Regulation D Compensation. In the event that a Bank is
required to maintain reserves of the type contemplated by the definition of
"Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage", such Bank may require the Borrower to pay,
contemporaneously with each payment of interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans,

24
<PAGE>

additional interest on the related Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per
annum determined by such Bank up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the
applicable London Interbank Offered Rate divided by (B) one minus the Euro-
Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable London Interbank Offered
Rate. Any Bank wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall
so notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such
additional interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans of such Bank shall be payable to
such Bank at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest
Period commencing at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days after the giving of
such notice and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least three Euro-Dollar
Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Dollar
Loans of the amount then due it under this Section. Each such notification shall
be accompanied by such information as the Borrower may reasonably request.

"Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage
(expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars in
respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any other category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other
assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to United
States residents).

SECTION 2.17. Increased Commitments; Additional Banks. (a) Subsequent to
the Effective Date, the Borrower may, on no more than three occasions, upon at
least 30 days' notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly provide
a copy of such notice to the Banks), propose to increase the aggregate amount of
the Commitments by an amount not to exceed in the aggregate for all such
increases $60,000,000 (the amount of any such increase, the "Increased
Commitments"). Each Bank party to this Agreement at such time shall have the
right (but no obligation), for a period of 15 days following receipt of such
notice, to elect by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to
increase its Commitment by a principal amount which bears the same ratio to the
Increased Commitments as its then Commitment bears to the aggregate Commitments
then existing.

(b) If any Bank party to this Agreement shall not elect to increase its
Commitment pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, the Borrower may
designate one or more banks or other financial institutions (which may be, but
need not be, one or more of the existing Banks) which at the time agree in the
case of any existing Bank to increase its Commitment and, in the case of any
other such bank (an "Additional Bank"), to become a party to this Agreement and

25
<PAGE>

assume a Commitment hereunder. The sum of the increases in the Commitments of
the existing Banks pursuant to this subsection (b) plus the Commitments of the
Additional Banks shall not in the aggregate exceed the unsubscribed amount of
the Increased Commitments.

(c)  An increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to
this Section 2.17 shall become effective upon the receipt of the Administrative
Agent of an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent signed by the Borrower, by each Additional Bank and by each other Bank
whose Commitment is to be increased, setting forth the new Commitments of such
Banks and setting forth the agreement of each Additional Bank to become a party
to this Agreement and to be bound by all the terms and provisions hereof,
together with such evidence of appropriate corporate authorization on the part
of the Borrower with respect to the Increased Commitments and such opinions of
counsel for the Borrower with respect to the Increased Commitments as the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

(d)  Upon any increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant
to this Section 2.17, within five Domestic Business Days, in the case of Base
Rate Loans then outstanding, and at the end of the then current Interest Period
with respect thereto, in the case of Euro-Dollar Loans then outstanding, the
Borrower shall prepay or repay such Loans in their entirety and, to the extent
the Borrower elects to do so and subject to the conditions specified in Article
3, the Borrower shall reborrow Committed Loans from the Banks in proportion to
their respective Commitments after giving effect to such increase, until such
time as all outstanding Committed Loans are held by the Banks in such
proportion.

Borrower and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and any Affiliate on the other,
taken in the aggregate and not individually, shall be on an arms-length basis on
terms no less favorable to the Borrower or such Subsidiary than could have been
obtained from a third party who was not an Affiliate; provided that the
foregoing provisions of this Section shall not prohibit the Borrower and each
Subsidiary from declaring or paying any lawful dividend so long as, after giving
effect thereto, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

SECTION 5.12. Indebtedness/Capitalization Ratio. The ratio of Consolidated
Indebtedness to Consolidated Capitalization will at no time exceed 65%.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

SECTION 7.01. Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank irrevocably appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the Notes as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together
with all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

SECTION 7.02. Administrative Agent and Affiliates. The Chase Manhattan Bank
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and
may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and The Chase Manhattan Bank and its affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if it were not
the Administrative Agent hereunder.

38
<PAGE>

SECTION 7.03. Action by Administrative Agent. The obligations of the
Administrative Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall
not be required to take any action with respect to any Default, except as
expressly provided in Article 6.

SECTION 7.04. Consultation with Experts. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 7.05. Liability of Administrative Agent. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable to any Bank for any action taken or not
taken by it in connection herewith (i) with the consent or at the request of the
Required Banks or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its affiliates nor any
of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any
statement, warranty or representation made in connection with this Agreement or
any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants or agreements of the Borrower; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition
specified in Article 3, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of this
Agreement, the Notes or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection
herewith. The Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in
reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other writing
(which may be a bank wire, telex or similar writing) believed by it in good
faith to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term "agent" in this
Agreement with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote
any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency
doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of
market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties.

SECTION 7.06. Indemnification. Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance with
its Commitment, indemnify the Administrative Agent, its affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including counsel fees
and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as
result from the such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct) that
such

39
<PAGE>

indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or any action
taken or omitted by such indemnitees thereunder.

SECTION 7.07. Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.08. Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon
any such resignation, the Borrower, with the consent of the Required Banks,
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), shall have the right
to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative
Agent shall have been so appointed, and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank
organized or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any
State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder; provided
that if such successor Administrative Agent is appointed without the consent of
the Borrower, such successor Administrative Agent may be replaced by the
Borrower with the consent of the Required Banks. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent.

SECTION 7.09.  Administrative Agent's Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times
previously agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

SECTION 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. If
on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro- Dollar
Borrowing or Bid Rate (Indexed) Borrowing:

(a)  the Administrative Agent is advised by the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks
that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to
the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period,
or

(b)  in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, Banks having 66 2/3% or more
of the aggregate amount of the affected Loans advise the Administrative Agent
that the London Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Administrative Agent
will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding their
Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall
forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon until the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to
such suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Banks to make Euro-
Dollar Loans or to continue or convert outstanding Loans as or into Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be suspended and (ii) each outstanding Euro-Dollar Loan shall be
converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest
Period applicable thereto. Unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent
at least one Domestic Business Day before the date of any Fixed Rate Borrowing
for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects not to
borrow on such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing,
such Borrowing shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such
Borrowing is a Bid Rate (Indexed) Borrowing, the Loans comprising such Borrowing
shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but
excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base
Rate for such day.

SECTION 8.02. Illegality. If, on or after the date of this Agreement, the
adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its
Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund any of its Euro-Dollar
Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower,
whereupon until such Bank notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
obligation of

41
<PAGE>

such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or to continue or convert outstanding Loans
as or into Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to
the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a
different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for
giving such notice and will not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank in the
good faith exercise of its discretion. If such notice is given, each Euro-Dollar
Loan of such Bank then outstanding shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan either
(a) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Euro-
Dollar Loan if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to
such day or (b) immediately if such Bank shall determine that it may not
lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan to such day.

SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If on or after (x) the
date of this Agreement, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation to
make Committed Loans or (y) the date of any related Bid Rate Quote, in the case
of any Bid Rate Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or
any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) issued on or after
such date of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement
(including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-
Dollar Loan any such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any
Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the London interbank market any
other condition (other than in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes) affecting its
Fixed Rate Loans, its Note or its obligation to make Fixed Rate Loans and the
result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect
thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days
after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction; provided that no such
amount shall be payable with respect to any period commencing more than 90 days
prior to the date such Bank first notifies the Borrower of its intention to
demand compensation therefor under this Section 8.03(a).

42
<PAGE>

(b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding
capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency given or made after the date of this Agreement, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its
Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder to a level below
that which such Bank (or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption,
change, request or directive (taking into consideration its policies with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material,
then from time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its Parent) for such
reduction; provided that no such amount shall be payable with respect to any
period commencing less than 30 days after the date such Bank first notifies the
Borrower of its intention to demand compensation under this Section 8.03(b).

(c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof,
which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid
the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate
of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

SECTION 8.04.  Taxes.  (a) For purposes of this Section 8.04, the following
terms have the following meanings:

"Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement or any Note, and all liabilities with respect
thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Administrative Agent,
taxes imposed on its income, net worth or gross receipts and franchise or
similar taxes imposed on it by a jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank
or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized or in which its
principal executive office is located or, in the case of each Bank, in which its
Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in the case of each Bank, any
United States

43
<PAGE>

withholding tax imposed on such payments except to the extent that such Bank is
subject to United States withholding tax by reason of a U.S. Tax Law Change.

"Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and
any other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise
from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the
execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any
Note.

"U.S. Tax Law Change" means with respect to any Bank or Participant the
occurrence (x) in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof,
after the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement and (y) in the
case of any other Bank, after the date such Bank shall have become a Bank
hereunder, and (z) in the case of each Participant, after the date such
Participant became a Participant hereunder, of the adoption of any applicable
U.S. federal law, U.S. federal rule or U.S. federal regulation relating to
taxation, or any change therein, or the entry into force, modification or
revocation of any income tax convention or treaty to which the United States is
a party.

(b)  Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any Bank
or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without
deduction for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 8.04) such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may
be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall
furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.01,
the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

(c)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Administrative
Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 8.04) paid by such Bank or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall
be paid within 15 days after such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case
may be) makes demand therefor.

(d)  Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this

44
<PAGE>

Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on
or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank,
and from time to time thereafter as required by law (but only so long as such
Bank remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower two completed
and duly executed copies of Internal Revenue Service form 1001 or 4224, as
appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service,
or other documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower, certifying that
such Bank is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United
States is a party which exempts the Bank from United States withholding tax or
reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest for the account of
such Bank or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United
States.

(e)  For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide the
Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.04(d) (unless such
failure is due to a U.S. Tax Law Change), such Bank shall not be entitled to
indemnification under Section 8.04(b) or 8.04(c) with respect to any Taxes or
Other Taxes which would not have been payable had such form been so provided,
provided that if a Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced
rate of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to
deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such
Bank shall reasonably request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes (it
being understood, however, that the Borrower shall have no liability to such
Bank in respect of such Taxes).

(f)  If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the
account of any Bank pursuant to this Section 8.04, then such Bank will take such
action (including changing the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office) as
in the good faith judgment of such Bank (i) will eliminate or reduce any such
additional payment which may thereafter accrue and (ii) is not otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank.

(g)  If any Bank or the Administrative Agent receives a refund (including a
refund in the form of a credit against taxes that are otherwise payable by the
Bank or the Administrative Agent) of any Taxes or Other Taxes for which the
Borrower has made a payment under Section 8.04(b) or (c) and such refund was
received from the taxing authority which originally imposed such Taxes or Other
Taxes, such Bank or the Administrative Agent agrees to reimburse the Borrower to
the extent of such refund, provided that nothing contained in this paragraph (g)
shall require any Bank or the Administrative Agent to make available its tax
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems to be
confidential).

SECTION 8.05. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed Rate Loans. If
(i) the obligation of any Bank to make or to continue or convert outstanding
Loans as or into Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02
or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.03(a) or 8.04 with
respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans and the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-
Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Administrative
Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such
Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no
longer apply:

(a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as (or continued
as or converted to) Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall instead be Base
Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously
with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and

(b)  after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all payments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Loans shall be applied
to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

If such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist, the principal amount of
each such Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a Euro-Dollar Loan on the first
day of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable to the related Euro-Dollar
Loans of the other Banks.

SECTION 8.06. Substitution of Bank Termination Option. If (i) the
obligation of any Bank to make or to convert or continue outstanding Loans as or
into Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02, (ii) any
Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04, or (iii) any Bank
exercises its right not to extend its Commitment Termination Date pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) or (iv) Investment Grade Status ceases to exist as to any Bank,
then:

(a)  the Borrower shall have the right, with the assistance of the
Administrative Agent, to designate a substitute bank or banks (which may be one
or more of the Banks) mutually satisfactory to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) to purchase for cash, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto, the outstanding Loans
of such Bank and assume the Commitment of such Bank, without recourse to or
warranty by, or expense to, such Bank, for a purchase price equal to the
principal amount of all of such Bank's outstanding Loans plus any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon and the accrued but unpaid fees in respect of such
Bank's Commitment hereunder plus such amount, if any, as would be payable
pursuant to

46
<PAGE>

Section 2.14 if the outstanding Loans of such Bank were prepaid in their
entirety on the date of consummation of such assignment; and

(b)  if at the time Investment Grade Status exists as to the Borrower, the
Borrower may elect to terminate this Agreement as to such Bank, provided that
(i) the Borrower notifies such Bank through the Administrative Agent of such
election at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days before the effective date of
such termination and (ii) the Borrower repays or prepays the principal amount of
all outstanding Loans made by such Bank plus any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon and the accrued but unpaid fees in respect of such Bank's Commitment
hereunder plus all other amounts payable by the Borrower to such Bank hereunder,
not later than the effective date of such termination. Upon satisfaction of the
foregoing conditions, the Commitment of such Bank shall terminate on the
effective date specified in such notice.

such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 9.04. Sharing of Set-offs. Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by
exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of
a proportion of the aggregate amount then due with respect to the Loans held by
it which is greater than the proportion received by any other Bank in respect of
the aggregate amount then due with respect to the Loans held by such other Bank,
the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participations in the Loans held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments
shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments with respect to the
Loans held by the Banks shall be shared by the Banks pro rata; provided that
nothing in this Section shall impair the right of any Bank to exercise any right
of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such
exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than its
indebtedness under this Agreement.

SECTION 9.05. Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement or
the Notes may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is
in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, are

48
<PAGE>

affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent); provided that no such amendment
or waiver shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the
Commitment of any Bank (except (x) as contemplated by Section 2.17 or (y) for a
ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or subject any Bank to any
additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any
Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of
principal of or interest on any Loan or interest thereon or any fees hereunder
or for termination of any Commitment or (iv) change the percentage of the
Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the
number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take
any action under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.06. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of all Banks.

(b)  Any Bank may, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), at any time grant to one or more banks or
other institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its
Commitment or any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank
of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the
Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of
its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to
which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such
Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations
of the Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not
agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 9.05 without the consent of the
Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent
provided in its participation agreement, be entitled to the benefits of Article
8 with respect to its participating interest, subject to the performance by such
Participant of the obligations of a Bank thereunder. An assignment or other
transfer which is not permitted by subsection (c) or (d) below shall be given
effect for purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating
interest granted in accordance with this subsection (b).

(c)  Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other
financial institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part
(equivalent

49
<PAGE>

to an initial Commitment of not less than $20,000,000 (unless the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent shall otherwise agree)) of all, of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and its Note (if any), and such Assignee shall
assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit G hereto executed by such
Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and only with and subject to) the prior
written consent of the Borrower (given in its sole discretion) and the
Administrative Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
provided that unless such assignment is of the entire right, title and interest
of the transferor Bank hereunder, after making any such assignment such
transferor Bank shall have a Commitment of at least $20,000,000 (unless the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall otherwise agree). Upon execution and
delivery of such instrument of assumption and payment by such Assignee to such
transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such
transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this
Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a
Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor
Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent,
and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon the
consummation of any assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor
Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate
arrangements so that, if required by the Assignee, a Note is issued to the
Assignee. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which
interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section
8.04. All assignments shall be subject to a transaction fee established by, and
payable by the transferor Bank to, the Administrative Agent for its own account
(which shall not exceed $5,000).

(d)  Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement and its Note (if any) to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such
assignment shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder or
modify any such obligations.

(e)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Bank's rights
(including any Applicable Lending Office other than such Bank's initial
Applicable Lending Office) shall be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 8.03 or 8.04 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive
with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made by reason
of the provisions of Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.04 requiring such Bank to designate
a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time
when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

50
<PAGE>

SECTION 9.07. Collateral. Each of the Banks represents to the
Administrative Agent and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not
relying upon any "margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in
the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

SECTION 9.08. Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent and each Bank
agrees to keep any information delivered or made available by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement confidential from anyone other than persons employed
or retained by such Bank and its affiliates who are engaged in evaluating,
approving, structuring or administering the credit facility contemplated hereby;
provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Bank from disclosing such
information (a) to any other Bank or to the Administrative Agent, (b) to any
other Person if reasonably incidental to the administration of the credit
facility contemplated hereby, (c) upon the order of any court or administrative
agency, (d) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority,
(e) which had been publicly disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure by
the Administrative Agent or any Bank prohibited by this Agreement, (f) in
connection with any litigation to which the Administrative Agent, any Bank or
its subsidiaries or Parent may be a party, (g) to the extent necessary in
connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (h) to such Bank's or
Administrative Agent's legal counsel and independent auditors and (i) subject to
provisions substantially similar to those contained in this Section 9.08, to any
actual or proposed Participant or Assignee.

SECTION 9.09. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and
each Note (if any) shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law
of the State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York and of any New York State court sitting in New York City for purposes
of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court
and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

SECTION 9.10. Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

SECTION 9.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY EFFECTIVELY DO
SO UNDER APPLICABLE LAW,

51
<PAGE>

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year
first above written.

"AA-" or higher by S&P or "Aa3" or higher by Moody's.

"Level II Status" exists at any date if, at such date, (i) the Borrower is
rated "A+" or higher by S&P or "A1" or higher by Moody's and (ii) Level I Status
does not exist.

"Level III Status" exists at any date if, at such date, (i) the Borrower is

Status nor Level II Status exists.

"Level IV Status" exists at any date if, at such date, (i) the Borrower is

the Commitments at such date. If for any reason any Loans remain outstanding
following termination of the Commitments, Utilization shall be deemed to be in

indicated for or assigned to the senior unsecured long-term debt securities of
the Borrower without third-party credit enhancement, and any rating indicated
for or assigned to any other debt security of the Borrower shall be disregarded.
The ratings in effect for any day are those in effect at the close of business
on such day. A change in credit rating will result in an immediate change in the
applicable Status. In the case of split ratings from S&P and Moody's, the rating
to be used to determine the applicable Status is the higher of the two.

To the Banks and the Administrative Agent
Referred to Below
c/o The Chase Manhattan Bank
as Administrative Agent
270 Park Avenue
New York, New York  10017

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am the General Counsel of Duke Capital Corporation (the "Borrower") and
have acted as its counsel in connection with the 364-Day Credit Agreement (the

therein defined.

In such capacity, I or attorneys under my direct supervision have examined
originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of
such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other
instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I
have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.

Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required
to carry on its business as now conducted.

2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit
Agreement and any Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not
contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or
regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower or,
to my knowledge, of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other
instrument binding upon the Borrower or, to
<PAGE>

my knowledge, result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of
the Borrower or any of its Material Subsidiaries.

3. The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Borrower and the Notes, if and when issued, will constitute valid and binding
obligations of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

4. Except as disclosed in the reports referred to in Section 4.04 of the
Credit Agreement, to my knowledge (but without independent investigation), there
is no action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened against or affecting, the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any
governmental body, agency or official, which would be likely to be decided
adversely to Borrower or such Subsidiary and, as a result, to have a material
adverse effect upon the business, consolidated financial position or
consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, considered as a whole or which in any manner draws into question
the validity of the Credit Agreement or any Notes.

5. Borrower is not a holding company under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended.

The phrase "to my knowledge", as used in the foregoing opinion, refers to
my actual knowledge without any independent investigation as to any such
matters.

I am a member of the Bar of the State of North Carolina and do not express
any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of North
Carolina, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal
law of the United States of America. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, I note that the governing law of the Loan Documents is expressed to
be the law of the State of New York; in giving the opinion set forth in
paragraph 3 above I have assumed, with your permission, that instead the
governing law is the law of the State of North Carolina.

This opinion is rendered to you in connection with the above matter and may
not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished

except for Additional Banks and Participants.

Very truly yours,

(the "Credit Agreement") dated as of August 21, 2000 among Duke Capital
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the banks listed on the
signature pages thereof (the "Banks") and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as
Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent"), and have acted as special

We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified
to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of
public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other
investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable for
purposes of this opinion.

Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the
Credit Agreement and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate powers and
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action.

2. The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
the Borrower and the Notes, if and when issued, constitute valid and binding
obligations of the Borrower enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
<PAGE>

In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no opinion as to the effect (if
any) of any law of any jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any
Bank is located which limits the rate of interest that such Bank may charge or
collect.

This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter.
This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon
by or furnished to any other person, firm or corporation without our prior
written consent, except for Additional Banks and all Participants.

Very truly yours,

W I T N E S S E T H

WHEREAS, this Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the "Agreement")
relates to the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of August 21, 2000 among the
Company, the Assignor and the other Banks party thereto, as Banks, and the

WHEREAS, Committed Loans made to the Borrower by the Assignor under the
Credit Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $__________ are
outstanding at the date hereof; and

WHEREAS, the Assignor proposes to assign to the Assignee all of the rights

Commitment thereunder in an amount equal to $__________ (the "Assigned Amount"),
together with a corresponding portion of its outstanding Committed Loans, and
the Assignee proposes to accept assignment of such rights and assume the
corresponding obligations from the Assignor on such terms;*

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

SECTION 1.  Definitions.  All capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.

SECTION 2. Assignment. The Assignor hereby assigns and sells to the
Assignee all of the rights of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement to the
extent of the Assigned Amount, and the Assignee hereby accepts such assignment

*The asterisked provisions shall be appropriately revised in the event of

<PAGE>

from the Assignor and assumes all of the obligations of the Assignor under the
Credit Agreement to the extent of the Assigned Amount, including the purchase
from the Assignor of the corresponding portion of the principal amount of the
Committed Loans made by the Assignor outstanding at the date hereof. Upon the
execution and delivery hereof by the Assignor, the Assignee, the Company and the
Administrative Agent and the payment of the amounts specified in Section 3
required to be paid on the date hereof (i) the Assignee shall, as of the date
hereof, succeed to the rights and be obligated to perform the obligations of a
Bank under the Credit Agreement with a Commitment in an amount equal to the
Assigned Amount, and (ii) the Commitment of the Assignor shall, as of the date
hereof, be reduced by a like amount and the Assignor released from its
obligations under the Credit Agreement to the extent such obligations have been
assumed by the Assignee. The assignment provided for herein shall be without
recourse to the Assignor.

SECTION 3. Payments. As consideration for the assignment and sale
contemplated in Section 2 hereof, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor on the
date hereof in Federal funds the amount heretofore agreed between them.* It is
understood that facility fees accrued to the date hereof in respect of the
Assigned Amount are for the account of the Assignor and such fees accruing from
and including the date hereof are for the account of the Assignee. Each of the
Assignor and the Assignee hereby agrees that if it receives any amount under the
Credit Agreement which is for the account of the other party hereto, it shall
receive the same for the account of such other party to the extent of such other
party's interest therein and shall promptly pay the same to such other party.

SECTION 4. Consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. This
Agreement is conditioned upon the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 9.06(c) of the Credit Agreement. The execution of this
Agreement by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent is evidence of this
consent. Pursuant to Section 9.06(c) the Borrower agrees to execute and deliver
a Note, if required by the Assignee, payable to the order of the Assignee to
evidence the assignment and assumption provided for herein.


*Amount should combine principal together with accrued interest and
breakage compensation, if any, to be paid by the Assignee. It may be preferable
in an appropriate case to specify these amounts generically or by formula rather
than as a fixed sum.

Credit Agreement or any Note. The Assignee acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance on the Assignor, and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and will continue to be responsible for
making its own independent appraisal of the business, affairs and financial
condition of the Borrowers.

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

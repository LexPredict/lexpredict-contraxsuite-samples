after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s
duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative
Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is
repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Daily Libor Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is













continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Lead Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding
Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

SECTION 2.09 Intentionally Omitted.

SECTION 2.10 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

(a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity Date. At the request of each Lender, the Loans made by such Lender shall be evidenced by a Note payable to such Lender in the amount of such Lender’s Commitment.

(b) Commencing on September 1, 2011 and on Monday of any week thereafter to the extent
the Payment Event shall be in existence during such week, the Borrower shall make a payment of principal in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) one hundred percent (100%) of the net cash proceeds (after deduction of net sales commission
and other reasonable expenses of such equity raises, not to exceed 13% of gross proceeds in the aggregate) of equity raised by the Parent during the prior calendar week (but in no event earlier than September 1, 2011), and (b) the amount
necessary to reduce the principal balance of the Loan such that the Payment Event shall no longer be in existence.
(c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender,
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the
amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender’s share thereof.
(e) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.











SECTION 2.11 Prepayment of Loans.

(a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay, without penalty, any
Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section, and subject to Section 2.16, if applicable.

(b) The Lead Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any
prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Los Angeles, California time, three (3) Business Days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR
Borrowing or a Daily Libor Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Los Angeles, California time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in
an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent
required by Section 2.13.
SECTION 2.12 Fees.

(a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee,
which shall accrue at .25% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the date of this Agreement to, but excluding, the earlier of (i) the date on which such
Commitment terminates and (ii) the Maturity Date. Facility fees accrued through and including the Maturity Date shall be payable on the Maturity Date and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the date hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) and shall be based on the then existing Commitments of the Lenders.
(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, (i) a commitment fee of $110,000.00 and (ii) upon the repayment in full of the Obligations, an exit fee in the
amount of $220,000.00, provided such exit fee shall be waived if the Loans are repaid in full in connection with the closing of the Proposed Facility.

(c) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the
Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.











SECTION 2.13 Interest.

(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the lesser of (x) the Alternate
Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate, or (y) the Maximum Rate.
(b) The Loans comprising
each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the lesser of (a) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate, or (b) the Maximum Rate.

(c) The Loans comprising each Daily Libor Borrowing shall bear interest at the lesser of (a) the
Daily Libor plus the Applicable Rate, or (b) the Maximum Rate
(d) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, after applicable grace periods, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, the lesser of (x) 4% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section, or (y) the Maximum Rate, or (ii) in the case of any other amount, the lesser of (x) 4% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section, or
(y) the Maximum Rate; and (B) after the occurrence of any Event of Default, at the option of the Administrative Agent, or if the Administrative Agent is directed in writing by the Required Lenders to do so, the Loan shall bear interest at
a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (x) 4% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section, or (y) the Maximum Rate.

(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan
and upon the Maturity Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment
of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan
prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and twelve
(12) 30-day months, and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Daily Libor, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.











SECTION 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing or Daily Libor Borrowing:
(a) the
Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Daily Libor or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such
Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
(i) the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for
such Interest Period and (ii) such fact is generally applicable to its loans of this type to similar borrowers, as evidenced by a certification from such Lenders;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lead Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the
Lead Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing
shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings,
then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs.

(a) If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition (other than one relating to
Excluded Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of
principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in












Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or
its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender, the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or
delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Lead Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period
of retroactive effect thereof.
SECTION 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of
(a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default but excluding any such payment made pursuant to a Payment Event),
(b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b)), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Lead
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender
shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that
would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.











SECTION 2.17 Taxes.

(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided that the Borrower receives ten (10 days prior written notice from the Administrative Agent
that it intends to pay any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the
return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is
a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Lead Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable law or reasonably requested by the Lead Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.











SECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder
(whether of principal, interest, fees or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Los Angeles, California time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without
set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such
payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its main offices in Cleveland, Ohio, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. If the
Administrative Agent receives a payment for the account of a Lender prior to 1:00 p.m., Los Angeles, California time, such payment must be delivered to the Lender on the same day and if it is not so delivered due to the fault of the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay to the Lender entitled to the payment interest thereon for each day after payment should have been received by the Lender pursuant hereto until the Lender receives payment, at the Federal Funds Effective
Rate. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the
period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
(b) If at any time
insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by
exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and
accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans,
other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the












foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Lead Borrower prior to the date on
which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective
Rate.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
2.07(b) or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such
Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION
2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) Each Lender will notify the
Lead Borrower of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle such Person to compensation pursuant to Sections 2.13 and 2.15 as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines
to request such compensation, provided that such Person shall not be liable for the failure to provide such notice. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount
to any such Person or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize the amounts payable, including, without limitation, the
designation of a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or the assignment of its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.











(b) If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund
Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided
that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal
of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), and
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and
delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.20 Extension. So long as no Event of Default or Default shall be
in existence on the date on which notice is given in accordance with the following clause (a) and on the Maturity Date, Borrower may extend the Maturity Date to December 28, 2011, upon satisfaction of the following: (a) delivery of a
written request to Administrative Agent at least thirty (30) days, but no more than forty five (45) days, prior to the Maturity Date then in effect; (b) payment to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders of a facility
extension fee equal to $55,000.00, which fee shall be payable on or before the then applicable Maturity Date, which fee shall be credited towards any commitment fee payable upon the closing of the Proposed Facility, if such closing occurs;
(c) the Administrative Agent and the Lead Borrower have executed a terms sheet or application for a proposed $25,000,000 revolving line of credit (the “Proposed Facility”) between the Administrative Agent and the Lead Borrower and,
from the date of execution thereof, are actively working towards a closing of the Proposed Facility; and (d) payment by Borrower of all fees and expenses to Administrative Agent and the Lenders to the extent then due. Such extension shall be
evidenced by delivery of written confirmation of the same by Administrative Agent to Borrower.
ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties
The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent that:
SECTION 3.01 Organization; Powers. Each Credit Party is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good
standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.











SECTION 3.02 Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are
within the corporate, partnership or limited liability company powers (as applicable) of the respective Credit Parties and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate, partnership or limited liability company action. This Agreement and the
Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by each Credit Party which is a party thereto and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each such Person, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

SECTION 3.03 Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) to the actual knowledge of the
Borrower, do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect or which shall be completed at the
appropriate time for such filings under applicable securities laws, (b) to the actual knowledge of the Borrower, will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of any Credit Party or
any of the Borrower’s Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon any Credit Party or any of the Borrower’s
Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by any Credit Party or any of the Borrower’s Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of
any Credit Party or any of the Borrower’s Subsidiaries, except pursuant to the Deed of Trust and the Pledge.
SECTION 3.04 Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.
(a) The Parent has heretofore furnished to the Lenders financial statements of the Parent as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 reported on by Reznick Group, independent public
accountants, for Borrower and the Parent. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for
such periods in accordance with GAAP.
(b) Since December 31, 2010, no event has occurred
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
SECTION 3.05 Properties.

(a) Subject to Liens permitted by Section 6.01, each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property material to its business, except for minor defects in title and title defects disclosed to Lenders that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its
business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes.











(b) Subject to the property conditions reports obtained by
the Borrower or a Subsidiary at the time of acquisition with respect to each Real Property, all components of all improvements included within the Real Property owned or leased, as lessee, by any Credit Party, including, without limitation, the
roofs and structural elements thereof and the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, sewer, waste water, storm water, paving and parking equipment, systems and facilities included therein, are in good working order
and repair, subject to such exceptions which are not reasonably likely to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All water, gas, electrical, steam, compressed air, telecommunication, sanitary and storm sewage lines and systems and other
similar systems serving the Real Property owned or leased by any Credit Party are installed and operating and are sufficient to enable the Real Property to continue to be used and operated in the manner currently being used and operated, and no
Credit Party has any knowledge of any factor or condition that reasonably could be expected to result in the termination or material impairment of the furnishing thereof, subject to such exceptions which are not likely to have, in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. No improvement or portion thereof is dependent for its access, operation or utility on any land, building or other improvement not included in the Real Property owned or leased by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, other than
for access provided pursuant to a recorded easement or other right of way establishing the right of such access subject to such exceptions which are not likely to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) To each Credit Party’s actual knowledge, all franchises, licenses, authorizations, rights of use,
governmental approvals and permits (including all certificates of occupancy and building permits) required to have been issued by Governmental Authority to enable all Real Property owned or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to be
operated as then being operated have been lawfully issued and are in full force and effect, other than those which the failure to obtain in the aggregate could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Credit Party is in
violation of the terms or conditions of any such franchises, licenses, authorizations, rights of use, governmental approvals and permits, which violation would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) None of the Credit Parties has received any notice or has any actual knowledge, of any pending,
threatened or contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any Real Property owned or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof, or any proposed termination or impairment of any parking (except as contemplated in any
approved expansion approved by Administrative Agent, at any such owned or leased Real Property or of any sale or other disposition of any Real Property owned or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any part thereof in lieu of
condemnation, which in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Except for events or conditions not reasonably likely to have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, (i) no portion of any Real Property owned or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has suffered any material damage by fire or other casualty loss which has not heretofore been completely repaired and restored to its condition prior
to such casualty, and (ii) no portion of any Real Property owned or leased












by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is located in a special flood hazard area as designated by any federal Government Authorities or any area identified by the insurance industry or other
experts acceptable to the Administrative Agent as an area that is a high probable earthquake or seismic area, except as set forth on Schedule 3.05(f).

(b) The Borrower shall maintain the following insurance coverages for each of the Mortgaged Properties in

(i) An all-risk policy of permanent property insurance insuring the Mortgaged
Property against all risks that are commonly covered under real property insurance except those permitted by the Administrative Agent in writing to be excluded from coverage thereunder.

(ii) A boiler and machinery insurance policy covering loss or damage to all portions of the Mortgaged
Property comprised of air-conditioning and heating systems, other pressure vessels, machinery, boilers or high pressure piping.

(vi) All required insurance will be written on forms acceptable to the Administrative Agent and by companies having a Best’s Insurance Guide Rating of not less than A or A+ and which are otherwise
acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and such insurance (other than third party liability insurance) shall be written or endorsed so that all losses are payable to the Administrative Agent, as Administrative Agent for the Lenders. The original
policies evidencing such insurance shall be delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and held












by the Administrative Agent, unless Administrative Agent expressly consents to accept insurance certificates instead. Each such policy shall expressly prohibit cancellation or modification of
insurance without thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Administrative Agent. The Borrower agrees to furnish due proof of payment of the premiums for all such insurance to Administrative Agent promptly after each such payment is made and
in any case at least fifteen (15) days before payment becomes delinquent.
(c) The
Borrower will pay and discharge all taxes, assessments, maintenance charges, permit fees, impact fees, development fees, capital repair charges, utility reservations and standby fees and all other similar impositions of every kind and character
charged, levied, assessed or imposed against any interest in any of the Mortgaged Property owned by it, as they become payable and before they become delinquent and that, if not paid, could result in a Material Adverse Effect before the same shall
become delinquent or in default, except where (a) the validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b) the Borrower or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
thereto in accordance with GAAP and (c) the failure to make payment pending such contest could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower shall furnish receipts evidencing proof of such payment to the
Administrative Agent promptly after payment and before delinquency.
(d) All proceeds of
insurance with respect to any Mortgaged Property shall be paid to Administrative Agent and, at Administrative Agent’s option, be applied to Borrower’s Obligations or released, in whole or in part, to pay for the actual cost of repair,
restoration, rebuilding or replacement (collectively, “Cost To Repair”). If the Cost To Repair does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the Pool Value of the subject Mortgaged Property, provided no Event of Default is then in
existence, Administrative Agent shall release so much of the insurance proceeds as may be required to pay for the actual Cost to Repair in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 5.06(e) below.

(e) If Administrative Agent elects or is required to release insurance proceeds, Administrative Agent may
impose, reasonable conditions on such release which shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(i) Prior written approval by Administrative Agent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed of plans, specifications, cost estimates, contracts and bonds for the restoration or repair
of the loss or damage;
(ii) Waivers of lien, architect’s certificates, contractor’s
sworn statements and other evidence of costs, payments and completion as Agent may reasonably require;
(iii) If the Cost To Repair does not exceed $500,000.00, the funds to pay therefor shall be released to Borrower. Otherwise, funds shall be released upon final completion of the Repair Work, unless
Borrower requests earlier












funding, in which event partial monthly disbursements equal to 90% of the value of the work completed shall be made prior to final completion of the repair, restoration or replacement and the
balance of the disbursements shall be made upon full completion and the receipt by Administrative Agent of satisfactory evidence of payment and release of all liens;

(iv) Determination by Administrative Agent that the undisbursed balance of such proceeds on deposit with
Administrative Agent, together with additional funds deposited for the purpose, shall be at least sufficient to pay for the remaining Cost To Repair, free and clear of all liens and claims for lien;

(v) All work to comply with the standards, quality of construction and Legal Requirements applicable to
the original construction of the Mortgaged Property;
(vi) in Administrative Agent’s good
faith judgment the Repair Work is likely to be completed at least three (3) months prior to the Maturity Date; and
(f) If there is any condemnation for public use of a Mortgaged Property or of any Collateral, the awards on account thereof shall be paid to Administrative Agent and shall be applied to Borrower’s
obligations, or at Administrative Agent’s discretion released to Borrower. If, in the case of a partial taking or a temporary taking, in the sole judgment of Administrative Agent the effect of such taking is such that there has not been a
material and adverse impairment of the viability of the Mortgaged Property or the value of the Collateral, so long as no Default exists Administrative Agent shall release awards on account of such taking to Borrower if such awards are sufficient (or
amounts sufficient are otherwise made available) to repair or restore the Administrative Property to a condition reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent subject to the requirements of Section 5.06(e).

SECTION 5.07 Books and Records; Inspection Rights.

(a) The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of record and account
in which full, true and correct entries are made of all dealings and transactions in relation to its business and activities.
(b) The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit any representatives designated by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, upon reasonable prior notice, to visit and inspect its
properties, to examine and make extracts from its books and records, and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its officers and independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested.

SECTION 5.08 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all
laws, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.












SECTION 5.09 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans will be used
for acquisition, acquisition fees and expenses, and financing of the Mortgaged Properties and other real properties to be acquired by Subsidiaries of the Lead Borrower. No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used, whether directly or
indirectly, for financing, funding or completing the hostile acquisition of publicly traded Persons or for any purpose that entails a violation of any of the Regulations of the Board, including Regulations U and X.

SECTION 5.10 Fiscal Year. Borrower shall maintain as its fiscal year the twelve (12) month period ending on
December 31 of each year.
SECTION 5.11 Environmental Matters.

(a) Borrower shall comply and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and each Real Property owned or leased
by such parties to comply in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws currently or hereafter in effect, except to the extent noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) If the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders at any time have a reasonable basis to believe
that there may be a material violation of any Environmental Law related to any Real Property owned or leased by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or Real Property adjacent to such Real Property, which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, then Borrower agrees, upon request from the Administrative Agent (which request may be delivered at the option of Administrative Agent or at the direction of Required Lenders), to provide the Administrative Agent, at the
Borrower’s expense, with such reports, certificates, engineering studies or other written material or data as the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may reasonably require so as to reasonably satisfy the Administrative Agent and the
Required Lenders that any Credit Party or Real Property owned or leased by them is in material compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.

(c) Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, take such Remedial Action or other action
as required by Environmental Law or any Governmental Authority except to the extent the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) If the Borrower fails to timely take, or to diligently and expeditiously proceed to complete in a
timely fashion, any action described in this Section, the Administrative Agent may, after notice to the Lead Borrower, with the consent of the Required Lenders, make advances or payments toward the performance or satisfaction of the same, but shall
in no event be under any obligation to do so. All sums so advanced or paid by the Administrative Agent (including reasonable counsel and consultant and investigation and laboratory fees and expenses, and fines or other penalty payments) and all sums
advanced or paid in connection with any judicial or administrative investigation












or proceeding relating thereto, will become due and payable from the Borrower ten (10) Business Days after demand, and shall bear interest at the rate for past due interest provided in
Section 2.13(c) from the date any such sums are so advanced or paid by the Administrative Agent until the date any such sums are repaid by the Borrower. Promptly upon request, the Borrower will execute and deliver such instruments as the
Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to permit the Administrative Agent to take any such action, and as the Administrative Agent may require to secure all sums so advanced or paid by the Administrative Agent. If a Lien is filed against
the Mortgaged Property by any Governmental Authority resulting from the need to expend or the actual expending of monies arising from an action or omission, whether intentional or unintentional, of the Borrower or for which any Borrower is
responsible, resulting in the Releasing of any Hazardous Material into the waters or onto land located within or without the State where the Mortgaged Property is located, then the Borrower will, within thirty (30) days from the date that the
Borrower is first given notice that such Lien has been placed against the Mortgaged Property (or within such shorter period of time as may be specified by the Administrative Agent if such Governmental Authority has commenced steps to cause the
Mortgaged Property to be sold pursuant to such Lien), either (i) pay the claim and remove the Lien, or (ii) furnish a cash deposit, bond or such other security with respect thereto as is satisfactory in all respects to the Administrative
Agent and is sufficient to effect a complete discharge of such Lien on the Mortgaged Property.
SECTION 5.12
Property Pool.

requirements of a Mortgaged Property, shall not subject to a Lien in any manner, other than Permitted Encumbrances, and shall meet the following requirements:

Borrower;

the appropriate Governmental Authority for all of the improvements on the Real Property;
(iii)
no material deferred maintenance and no material capital improvements are required or if required, adequate reserves, pledged to the Agent, are made therefor to continue operating as a self-storage property (or such other use as the Majority Lenders

ARTICLE VIII
The Administrative Agent
Each of the Lenders hereby
irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In the event of conflicting instructions or notices given to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent and any Lender, the Borrower is hereby directed and shall rely conclusively on the
instruction or notice given by the Administrative Agent.
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be
subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances
as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Credit Party that
is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the












Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall
be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or
inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or
(v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent agrees that, in
fulfilling its duties hereunder, it will use the same standard of care it utilizes in servicing loans for its own account.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur
any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by
it in good faith in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The
Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its
duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the
Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Lead Borrower, and may be removed by the Required Lenders in the event of the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Upon any such resignation
or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the approval of Borrower (provided no Default has occurred and is continuing), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or is removed, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a Lender, or a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the












retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative
Agent for its own behalf shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall cooperate with any successor Administrative Agent in fulfilling its duties hereunder.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

ARTICLE IX

SECTION 9.02 Waivers; Amendments.
(a) No
failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and
under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to
an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the
Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of
expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the
written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify
any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) release any Credit Party from its obligations under the Loan Documents or release any Collateral, except as
specifically provided for herein, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) subordinate the Loans or any Collateral without the written consent of each Lender, (viii) waive or modify any conditions of extending the Loans set forth
in Section 2.19 without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, or (ix) consent to the Collateral securing any other Indebtedness without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall
amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.











(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary none of the Lenders or the existing Borrower will be required to execute assumption or amendment documents to add a Person as a Borrower or as a Guarantor. If Real Property assets are added to the Pool in accordance with this Agreement and
the owner is not already a Borrower, then such owner may be added as a Borrower as required by Section 5.12 pursuant to a Joinder Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F executed by such owner and delivered to the
Administrative Agent, and in each case Borrower, Guarantor, such owner and the Administrative Agent will enter into an amendment to the Environmental Indemnity.

SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

(a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this
Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its
rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred (including any Appraisal costs) during any waivers, workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.

(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related
Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom,
(iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses,












claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a court of law in a final non-appealable judgment, or
the breach of this Agreement by the Indemnitee, including without limitation, the failure of the Indemnitee to make advances pursuant to its Commitment in breach of its obligations hereunder.

(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the
Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law,
the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten days after written demand
therefor.
SECTION 9.04 Successors and Assigns.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or
transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted
hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to
one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld) of:
(A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be
required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if a Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; and











(B) the Administrative Agent.

Provided, no consent of the Borrower or Administrative Agent shall be required in connection with any
assignment to an entity acquiring, or merging with, a Lender.
(ii) Assignments shall be
subject to the following additional conditions:
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a
Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of
the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000.00 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no
such consent of the Borrower shall be required if a Default has occurred and is continuing and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement;

(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.00; and
(D) the assignee,
if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term “Approved Fund” has the following meaning:

“Approved Fund” means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing,
holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity
that administers or manages a Lender.
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.











(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v) Upon its receipt of a
duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained
therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

(c) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations
to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided
that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) Borrower’s obligations hereunder shall not be
increased. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to
Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (d) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the
same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08
as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.











(d) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made
with the Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Lead Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.
(e) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to
secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
SECTION
9.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and
9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the
termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
SECTION 9.06 Counterparts; Integration;
Effectiveness; Joint and Several.
(a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and
by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.

(b) This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.











(c) Except as provided in Section 4.01, this
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties
hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
(d) Each Person constituting
the Borrower shall be bound jointly and severally with one another to make, keep, observe and perform the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities imposed by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents upon the
“Borrower.”
(e) Each Borrower agrees that it shall never be entitled to be
subrogated to any of the Administrative Agent’s or any Lender’s rights against any Credit Party or other Person or any collateral or offset rights held by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders for payment of the Loans until the full and
final payment of the Loans and all other obligations incurred under the Loan Documents and final termination of the Lenders’ obligations, if any, to make further advances under this Agreement or to provide any other financial accommodations to
any Credit Party. The value of the consideration received and to be received by each Borrower is reasonably worth at least as much as the liability and obligation of each Borrower incurred or arising under the Loan Documents. Each Borrower has
determined that such liability and obligation may reasonably be expected to substantially benefit each Borrower directly or indirectly. Each Borrower has had full and complete access to the underlying papers relating to the Loans and all of the Loan
Documents, has reviewed them and is fully aware of the meaning and effect of their contents. Each Borrower is fully informed of all circumstances which bear upon the risks of executing the Loan Documents and which a diligent inquiry would reveal.
Each Borrower has adequate means to obtain from each other Borrower on a continuing basis information concerning such other Borrower’s financial condition, and is not depending on the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to provide such
information, now or in the future. Each Borrower agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Lenders shall have any obligation to advise or notify any Borrower or to provide any Borrower with any data or information regarding any
other Borrower.
SECTION 9.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and
the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits of any Borrower (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the
credit or the account of a Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made












any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Lead Borrower after any such setoff and application made by such Lender,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such
Lender may have.
SECTION 9.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.
(b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Boston, Massachusetts and in New York, New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against the
Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing choice of law:

(i) matters relating to the creation, perfection, priority and enforcement of the liens on and
security interests in a Mortgaged Property or other assets situated in another jurisdiction(s), including by way of illustration, but not in limitation, actions for foreclosure, for injunctive relief, or for the appointment of a receiver, shall be
governed by the laws of such state;
(ii) Administrative Agent shall comply with applicable law
in such state to the extent required by the law of such jurisdiction(s) in connection with the foreclosure of the security interests and liens created under the Deed of Trust or exercising any rights with respect to the Property directly, and the
other Loan Documents with respect to the Property or other assets situated in another jurisdiction; and
(iii) provisions of Federal law and the law of such other jurisdiction(s) shall apply in defining the terms Hazardous Materials, Environmental Laws and Legal Requirements applicable to the Property as
such terms are used in this Loan Agreement, the Environmental Indemnity and the other Loan Documents











(c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.
(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

SECTION 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 9.11 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of
reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
SECTION 9.12 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal
process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the
Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a
source












other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from any Credit Party relating to the Credit Party or its business, other than
any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Credit Party; provided that, in the case of information received from any Credit Party after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such
Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

SECTION 9.13 Interest Rate Limitation. If at any time there exists a maximum rate of interest which may be
contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lenders in accordance with applicable law (the “Maximum Rate”), then notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time the interest applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the “Charges”), shall exceed such Maximum Rate, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been paid in respect of such Loan but were not payable as result of the operation of this
Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to the Lenders in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by the Lenders. If, for any reason whatsoever, the Charges paid or received on the Loans produces a rate which exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Lenders shall credit against
the principal of the Loans (or, if such indebtedness shall have been paid in full, shall refund to the payor of such Charges) such portion of said Charges as shall be necessary to cause the interest paid on the Loans to produce a rate equal to the
Maximum Rate. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holders of the Loans for the use, forbearance or detention of the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts throughout
the full term of this Agreement, so that the interest rate is uniform throughout the full term of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section shall control all agreements, whether now or hereafter existing and whether written or oral, between the
parties hereto. Without notice to the Borrower or any other person or entity, the Maximum Rate, if any, shall automatically fluctuate upward and downward as and in the amount by which such maximum nonusurious rate of interest permitted by applicable
law fluctuates.
SECTION 9.14 USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant
to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information
includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.

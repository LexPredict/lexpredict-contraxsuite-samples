II.      THE CREDIT FACILITIES

2.01 The "A" Line of Credit. So long as no Default or Event of Default
under this Agreement exists at the time a request for issuance is made, the "A"
line of credit facility (the ` "A" Line of Credit') shall be available, for a
period of three (3) years from the Closing Date up to a total aggregate
principal amount of SEVENTEEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND 00/100 US
DOLLARS ($17,500.000.00) for the issuance of Standby Letters of Credit and
Commercial Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower and/or any Guarantor
for the purpose of issuing a letter of credit to an insurance company, lending
company or customer of Borrower and/or Guarantor in lieu of a retention or
posting of a bid, performance or completion bond in a construction contract for
Borrower's insurance policies, as follows:

9

<PAGE>


(A) General. Standby Letters of Credit and Commercial Letters
of Credit (collectively, the "Letters of Credit") requested under this
subsection shall be upon written request by Borrower three (3) Banking Days
prior to the intended date of issuance and, in the event such Letter of Credit
is to be issued on behalf of a Guarantor, by Borrower and such Guarantor (as
co-applicants) to Administrative Agent ("Request for Letters of Credit"),
stating the specific purpose of each such Letter of Credit, the type of credit
(Standby Letter of Credit or Commercial Letter of Credit) and the specific
entity (whether Borrower or one or more of Guarantors) for whose account such
Letter of Credit is to be issued and shall provide all information required for
issuance, including names and addresses of all beneficiaries. Any such Letters
of Credit requested shall carry an expiry of not more than one (1) year, shall
be in good commercial form, payable against presentation of documents only, and
incorporate only clear and concise terms and conditions for payment, without
ambiguities. Any Letters of Credit or advances outstanding under the "A" Line of
Credit established under the First Amended Facility at the Closing of this
Second Amended Facility shall be treated as issued under this "A" Line of
Credit, with no change, however, in the expiry or terms of any such advances or
Letter of Credit, all of which are set forth on Schedule 2.01(A) hereto.

(B) Effect of Issuance. The issuance of any Letters of Credit
under the "A" Line of Credit shall reduce the availability of further Letters of
Credit or Advances under this "A" Line of Credit by the amount subject to
payment under the same, unless and until the same expires.

(C) Payment Under Letters of Credit. Any payments which
Administrative Agent is required to make under the terms of any Letter of Credit
shall be treated as cash Advances under the "A" Line of Credit and shall be
repaid to Administrative Agent, for the account of Lenders on or before the
expiration date provided for under the relevant Letter of Credit. Such payments
shall likewise reduce the availability of the "A" Line of Credit for the
issuance of further Letters of Credit in the amount of the same until and to the
extent that such payments shall be repaid. Interest on the outstanding balance
of such Advances shall be payable monthly, in arrears. Upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default, and while there are any Letters of Credit outstanding,
Borrower shall provide to Lenders additional collateral in the form of cash
deposits, if requested by Majority Lenders. Borrower shall pay immediately any
amount drawn under a Letter of Credit after the expiration of the "A" Line of
Credit.

(D) Fees for Issuance of Letters of Credit. Fees for issuance
of Standby Letters of Credit and Commercial Letters of Credit shall be
determined at the time a Request for Letter of Credit is submitted, according to
Borrower's election, at either:

(1)      eighty-seven and one-half basis points
(0.875%) per annum of the amount subject to
payment under the relevant Letter of Credit,
payable quarterly, in advance, at issuance
and at the beginning of each quarter
thereafter for so long as the relevant
Letter of Credit remains outstanding,
together with any renewals thereof; or

10

<PAGE>


(2)      seventy five basis points (0.75%) per annum
of the amount subject to payment under the
relevant Letter of Credit, in advance, at
issuance and at each anniversary thereafter
for so long as the relevant Letter of Credit
remains outstanding, together with any
renewals thereof.

(E) Interest Rate on Payments Made Under Letters of Credit.
Interest on all payments made by Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.01(C) shall be charged at the Prime Rate plus one per cent (1%) per
annum from the date of payment until the repayment thereof.

(F) Letter of Credit Agreement. Borrower shall execute
Administrative Agent's standard Letter of Credit Application/Agreement with
respect to each Request for Letter of Credit under the "A" Line of Credit.

(G) Manner of Participation in Letters of Credit.
Notwithstanding any other term herein contained, Administrative Agent shall be
the sole issuer of Letters of Credit under the "A" Line of Credit on behalf of
all Lenders. Upon notifications as provided for in Sections 2.07 and 10.01, each
Lender shall set up appropriate reserves on their respective books for the
contingent liability to Administrative Agent represented by the issuance of any
Letter of Credit, and (except for Administrative Agent as Lender) shall issue
its own standby letter of credit, in favor of Administrative Agent, in
accordance with the respective Commitments set forth in Paragraph 2.05. Once
Administrative Agent has been required to pay under the terms of a Letter of
Credit, each Lender shall be required to fund or reimburse such payment to
Administrative Agent, in accordance with such Lender's Commitment, as set forth
in Section 2.05 hereof. Lenders, parties to the First Amended Facility, agree to
adjust their respective Pro Rata Share of commitments, among themselves, in
proportion to their interests, in Advances and Letters of Credit outstanding
under the "A" Line of Credit of the First Amended Facility.

(H) Note. The "A" Line of Credit shall be evidenced by a
master promissory note (Note "A"), substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit "A".

2.02 The "B" Line of Credit. So long as no Default or Event of Default
under this Agreement exists at the time a request for borrowing is made
hereunder, for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, the "B" line
of credit facility (the `"B" Line of Credit') will be available on a revolving
basis for Advances each having a term of up to one hundred eighty (180) days.
During the period when the "B" Line of Credit is available, Borrower may borrow,
pay, prepay (subject to Section 2.10 hereof) and re-borrow, on a revolving
basis, up to a maximum principal amount of FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS
($50,000,000.00), as follows:

(A) General. The initial Advance under the "B" Line of Credit
shall be utilized for general working capital purposes of Borrower and
Guarantors, and shall be drawn at Closing for the purpose of paying all of
Borrower and Guarantors' then existing Obligations under the "B" Line of Credit
of the First Amended Facility. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall elect a term
for such initial Advance of either thirty (30), sixty (60), ninety (90) or one
hundred

11

<PAGE>


eighty (180) days and the rate of interest elected under the terms of Section
2.02(C) hereof. From and after such initial Advance, further Advances requested

funding each Advance stating the specific purpose of each Advance, the specific
entity (whether Borrower or one or more of Guarantors) utilizing said Advance,
the period of time for which the Advance is requested, either thirty (30), sixty
(60), ninety (90) or one hundred eighty (180) days, and the rate of interest
elected under the terms of Section 2.02(C). Each Request for Advance under the

one hundred eighty (180) day LIBOR rate
effective on the date of such Advance
according to the term for which the relevant
Advance is requested, plus one and
one-quarter of one percent (1.25%) per

(2)      the Prime Rate minus one and one-eighth of
one per cent (1.125%) per annum, to change
with each change in the Prime Rate.

Interest based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be. Interest based on LIBOR shall be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year in each case for the actual number of days elapsed
(i.e., 1/360 of a full year's interest shall accrue for each day any LIBOR based
Advance is outstanding) and shall be due quarterly (or, if earlier, at maturity)
and payable in arrears. Said interest rate shall never exceed the maximum rate
allowed, from time to time, by law.

(D) Non-Utilization Fee. Borrower shall pay to Administrative
Agent in arrears, for the ratable account of Lenders, on a quarterly basis and
on the date of termination of the availability of funds under this Second
Amended Facility, a non-utilization fee equal to fifteen (15) basis points
(0.15%) per annum of the difference between the total amount available under the
"B" Line of Credit and the average of the Advances outstanding during the three
(3) month period immediately preceding such quarter.

(E) Note. The "B" Line of Credit shall be evidenced by a
master promissory note (Note "B"), substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit "B".

and the remaining balance in the principal amount of Three Million Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($3,750,000.00) plus accrued interest thereon

(1.75%) per annum, to change in accordance
with the LIBOR Rate applicable to each
relevant Interest Period elected by Borrower
thereafter, provided, however, that, if at
the end of any relevant Interest Period
Borrower shall not make such an election on
a timely basis, then the one hundred eighty
(180) day rate shall be applicable; or

(2)      the Prime Rate minus one-half of one per
cent (0.50%) per annum, to change with each
change in the Prime Rate.

Interest based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365

(i.e., 1/360 of a full year's interest shall accrue for each day any LIBOR based
Advance is outstanding) and shall be due quarterly (or, if earlier, at maturity)

2.06 Lenders' Several Liability. The rights and obligations of Lenders
under this Agreement are several and, accordingly:

(A) the amount at any time owing hereunder by Borrower to each
Lender shall be a separate and independent debt and each Lender shall be
entitled to protect and enforce its respective rights arising out of this
Agreement, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral Documents; and

(B) the failure of any Lender to perform its obligations
hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender, Administrative Agent, Borrower or
any Guarantor of any of its respective obligations, nor shall any Lender or
Administrative Agent be responsible for the obligations of any other Lender or
Administrative Agent.

2.07 Notice to Administrative Agent and Lenders. Borrower shall
promptly notify Administrative Agent of each Request for Advance and each
Request for Letter of Credit and shall forward a duplicate original thereof to
each Lender. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each Lender shall make
available its Pro Rata Share of Commitments in the relevant Advance to
Administrative Agent.

2.08 Request Irrevocable. A Request for Advance or a Request for Letter
of Credit, once delivered to Administrative Agent, shall be irrevocable and
Borrower shall be bound to draw the Advance or accept the issuance of the Letter
of Credit in accordance therewith, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement. If, for any reason, an Advance is not drawn in accordance with a
Request for Advance or a Request for Letter of Credit is not issued, Borrower
shall, on demand, pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender
such amount (if any) as such Lender may certify to be necessary to compensate it
for any loss or expense incurred in liquidating or redeploying funds arranged
for the purpose of the proposed Advance not having been drawn or the proposed
Letter of Credit not having been issued in accordance with the Request for
Advance or Request for Letter of Credit.

2.09 Payment to Lenders. All sums payable to Lenders hereunder shall be
paid to Administrative Agent for the ratable account of Lenders in immediately
available funds, in lawful money of the United States of America. Administrative
Agent shall send Borrower statements for all amounts due hereunder, which
statements shall be considered correct and conclusively binding on Borrower,
unless Borrower notifies Administrative Agent to the contrary within fifteen
(15)

16

<PAGE>


calendar days of its receipt of any statement which it deems to be incorrect.
Alternatively, at their sole discretion, each Lender may charge against any
deposit account of Borrower, all or any part of any amounts due hereunder.

2.10 Prepayment of Advances. Borrower shall have the right to prepay
any Advance hereunder, in a minimum amount of One Million US Dollars
($1,000,000.00). Prime Rate Advances shall be prepayable without penalty. In the
event that Borrower prepays all or any part of any Advance with respect to which
the LIBOR based rate of interest has been elected other than on the last date of
the relevant Interest Period for such Advance, then the rate of interest
applicable to any portion of such Advance that remains outstanding shall become
the Prime Rate (to change with each change in such Prime Rate) and Borrower
shall reimburse Lenders for costs incurred by Lenders as a result of having
funded such Advance as a LIBOR Rate based Advance, by paying Lenders the sum of
$100.00 per Lender plus, in the event the LIBOR Rate on the date of such
prepayment is less than the LIBOR Rate effective for such Advance, a sum equal
to the difference, on an annualized basis, between the LIBOR Rate effective for
such Advance and the LIBOR Rate effective on the date of such prepayment times
the amount of principal of such Advance for the remaining days between the date
of prepayment and the last day of such relevant Interest Period. All prepayments
under this Section 2.10 shall be made together with accrued interest to the date
of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. Any prepayment of Advances
pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be applied to the installments thereof in
inverse order of maturity. Hedging Instrument transactions or agreements shall
not be prepayable.

2.11 Post-Maturity Rates. In the event any principal amount of any
Advance, or any other monetary Obligation of Borrower has not been paid when due
hereunder (whether on the stated maturity date, upon acceleration or otherwise)
Borrower shall pay, but only to the extent permitted by law, interest (after as
well as before judgment) on such unpaid principal amount at a rate per annum
(the "Post-Maturity Rate") equal to the Prime Rate plus a margin of 5%.

2.12 Option to Extend Term. So long as there is no Default, and subject
to the approval by all Lenders, Borrower shall have the option to extend the
expiration of the original three (3) year term of the "A", "B" and " D" Lines of
Credit for two (2) consecutive one (1) year terms by submitting a written
request for extension at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the
expiration of the original three (3) year term and one (1) year option term, as
applicable. Lenders shall have one hundred twenty (120) days following the
receipt of such request to approve or deny any request for extension. The
failure of any Lender to respond to any request for extension pursuant to this
Section 2.12 shall constitute a denial of such request.

this Agreement or any Collateral Document, as Lenders may require as a result of
circumstances arising or becoming known to Lenders since the date of the
previous funding of an Advance or Letter of Credit or, if no funding has been
made, the date of this Agreement.

All Requests for Advance made under this Agreement shall follow the form of
Exhibit "E", attached hereto and made a part hereof.

Each Request for Advance or Request for Letter of Credit, as applicable,

IV.      COLLATERAL SECURITY

4.01 Composition of the Collateral. Borrower and each Guarantor grants
or confirms the prior grant to Lenders under the Original Credit Facility and
the First Amended Facility, as appropriate, a Lien on and security interest in
the following property belonging to each of them (the "Collateral") as security
for the payment of the Obligations whether now existing or hereafter arising and
the performance by Borrower and each Guarantor of its obligations under this
Agreement and any Hedging Instrument entered into from time to time:

(A) All machinery, equipment, vehicles, vessels, aircraft,
fixtures, buildings, appliances, furniture and other tangible assets, now owned
or hereafter acquired and wherever located.

(B) All inventory now owned or hereafter acquired and products
and proceeds thereof.

(C) All accounts, contract rights and accounts receivable, now
or hereafter in existence and all proceeds thereof, and all returned or
repossessed goods arising from or relating to any of the said accounts or
rights.

(D) All instruments, documents, chattel paper and general
intangibles, rights in trademarks, trade names, patents, copyrights and licenses
now owned or hereafter acquired or arising.

20

<PAGE>


(E) All cash or non-cash proceeds of any of the foregoing,
including insurance proceeds.

(F) All ledger sheets, files, records, documents, and
instruments (including, but not limited to, computer programs, tapes and related
electronic data processing software) evidencing an interest or relating to the
above, and all products or proceeds of the above.

(G) All substitutes, and replacements for, accessions,
attachments, and other additions to, and tools, parts, and equipment used in
connection with any of the above, and all products and proceeds of the above.

Such security interest shall be evidenced by appropriate security agreements or
amendments to such security agreements executed in connection with the Second
Amended Facility or mortgages, trust deeds or other instruments in such form as
may be required by law and shall be perfected, as required by Administrative
Agent, in all appropriate jurisdictions. The Collateral, together with all of
Borrower's other property or the property of any Guarantor of any kind held by
any Lenders, shall stand as one general, continuing collateral security for all
Obligations, and such continuing security interest may be retained by Lenders
until all Obligations have been satisfied in full. All existing UCC-1 financing
statements filed pursuant to the Original Credit Facility, and UCC-3 financing
statements filed pursuant to the First Amended Facility, shall be amended to
identify all of Lenders under this Agreement and additional UCC-1 financing
statements will be filed to perfect the security interests granted by any
Guarantor under this Agreement who was not party to the First Amended and
Restated Facility Agreement.

4.02 Rights in Property Held by Lenders. As security for the prompt
satisfaction of all Obligations, Borrower hereby assigns, transfers and sets
over to Lenders all of its right, title and interest in and to, and grants
Lenders a Lien on and a security interest in, all amounts that may be owing from
time to time by Lenders to Borrower in any capacity, including, without
limitation, any balance or share belonging to Borrower of any deposit or other
account with Lenders, which Lien and security interest shall be independent of
any right of set-off which any of Lenders may have. The security interest shall
be shared among Lenders as agreed to by them.

4.03 Priority of Liens. The foregoing Liens shall be first and prior
Liens except for the Permitted Liens.


4.04 Financing Statements. Borrower shall:

(A) Join and cause each Guarantor to join with Lenders in
executing such financing statements (including amendments thereto and
continuation statements thereof), in form and content, satisfactory to
Administrative Agent, as Administrative Agent may specify;

21

<PAGE>


(B) Pay or reimburse Administrative Agent for any present and
future costs and taxes of filing or recording the same in such public offices as
the Administrative Agent may designate in such jurisdictions; and

(C) Take such other steps as the Administrative Agent may
direct, including the noting of Lenders' Lien on the Collateral and on any
certificates of title therefor.

A carbon, photographic, or other reproduction of this Agreement shall be
sufficient as a financing statement and may be filed, in Lenders' sole
discretion, in any appropriate office in lieu thereof.

To the extent lawful, Borrower hereby appoints Administrative Agent and each
Lender as its attorney-in-fact (without requiring the Administrative Agent or
any Lender to act as such) to execute any financing statement or other filing in
the name of Borrower, and to perform all other acts that the Administrative
Agent or such Lender deems appropriate to perfect and continue its security
interest in, and to protect and preserve, the Collateral.

4.05 Other Perfection of Security Interests. Administrative Agent or
Lenders may elect not to perfect the security interests in all of the
Collateral, including any such Collateral as may require perfection by registry
upon title certificates (as in the case, in certain jurisdictions, of motor
vehicle title certificates). Administrative Agent and Lenders, nevertheless,
reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to require the perfection of such
security interests in the future and Borrower agrees to cooperate with such
perfection.

4.06 Reservation of Right to Require Additional Collateral. In the
event of the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Agreement,
Administrative Agent and Lenders further reserve the right, but shall not have
the obligation, to require that Borrower and any or all of Guarantors grant
additional collateral security for repayment of the Second Amended Facility
including, but not limited to, mortgages, deeds of trust and other security
interests in any and all real estate or other assets, (not included in the
Collateral), owned or hereafter acquired by Borrower or any Guarantor.

Guarantors, will be vulnerable to a Year 2000 Problem or will be vulnerable to
the effects of a Year 2000 Problem suffered by any of Borrower's or any of the
Guarantor's major commercial counter-parties. Borrower shall take all actions
necessary and commit adequate resources to assure that its computer-based and
other systems (and those of all Guarantors) are able to effectively process

of Lenders, Borrower will provide Lenders with assurances and substantiations
(including, but not limited to, the results of internal or external audit
reports prepared in the ordinary course of business) reasonably acceptable to
Lenders as to the capability of Borrower and Guarantors to conduct its and their
businesses and operations before, on and after January 1, 2000 without
experiencing a Year 2000 Problem causing a Material Adverse Effect. Borrower
represents and warrants that it has a reasonable basis to believe that no Year

superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated in such Borrower SEC Reports or necessary in
order to make the statements in such Borrower SEC Reports, in light of the

case, any related notes) contained in Borrower SEC Reports, including any
Borrower SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the

financial position of Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates

on the appropriate books of Borrower or Guarantor. If Borrower or any Guarantor
defaults in the payment of any principal (or installment thereof) of, or

or Guarantor and be reimbursed, on demand, by Borrower.

<PAGE>


(1) Maintain a ratio of total liabilities to Tangible
Net Worth of not more than 2.50:1. Such ratio shall be calculated by dividing
Borrower's total liabilities by Borrower's Tangible Net Worth. "Tangible Net
Worth" shall mean Borrower's shareholders' equity less Borrower's intangible
assets, net of accumulated amortization.

(2) Maintain a quick ratio of not less than .6:1 or a
current ratio of not less than 1.4:1. The quick ratio shall be calculated by
dividing the sum of Borrower's cash and net accounts receivable by Borrower's
current liabilities. The current ratio shall be calculated by dividing
Borrower's current assets by Borrower's current liabilities.

(3) Maintain a maximum Total Funded Debt to EBITDA
ratio of 4:1. Such ratio shall be calculated on any given date by dividing
Borrower's Total Funded Debt on that date by Borrower's EBITDA on that date.

(4) Maintain a maximum Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA
ratio of 3:1. Such ratio shall be calculated on any given date by dividing
Borrower's Senior Funded Debt on that date by Borrower's EBITDA on that date.

(5) Maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio not less
than 1.35:1. The fixed charge coverage ratio shall be an amount equal to
Borrower's EBITDAR minus Borrower's expenditures for maintenance of leased and
owned equipment divided by the sum of total interest expense plus rent expense
plus dividends on preferred stock plus current maturities of Borrower's long
term debt and capital leases.

(6) Limit cash dividends to fifty per cent (50%) of
each Fiscal Year's net income, as shown in Borrower's or Guarantor's audited
Financial Statements, as the case may be. Such dividends shall only be paid
after the close of the corresponding Fiscal Year. Stock splits and stock
dividends shall not be restricted.

(N) Clear all Liens encumbering the assets of any newly
acquired Subsidiary within ninety (90) days of the consummation of any such
acquisition.

(O) Perform and observe, and cause each Guarantor to perform
and observe, all agreements, covenants, obligations, terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Notes, any Collateral Document or other instrument executed
in connection with this Agreement, the Notes, any Collateral Document and any
Advance.

(P) Duly observe, conform and comply with all laws, decisions,
judgments, rules, regulations and orders of all governmental authorities
relative to the conduct of its businesses, its properties, and Collateral,
except those being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently
pursued; and obtain, maintain and keep in full force and effect all governmental
licenses, authorizations and permits necessary to the proper conduct of its
businesses.

29

<PAGE>


(Q) Cause each newly acquired Subsidiary to become a Guarantor
hereunder and to execute all documents and instruments necessary to effect such
guarantee or as may otherwise be requested by Administrative Agent within ninety
(90) days following the consummation of such acquisition.

(R) Provide to Administrative Agent, on a quarterly basis,
with an updated list of all new Subsidiaries acquired, or field offices opened,
by Borrower or Guarantor containing their respective locations and addresses.

(S) Provide Administrative Agent, on a semi-annual basis, a
list of any additional assets titled or untitled acquired or sold by Borrower or
any Guarantor and the location of such assets.

(T) Borrower and/or Guarantors shall use the proceeds from the
Advances for the purpose or purposes set forth in Article II of this Agreement.

purpose of amortizing capital leases;

(3)      Indebtedness, up to Fifteen Million US
Dollars ($15,000,000.00) per year,

<PAGE>


(6)      current accounts payable, accrued expenses

assets. Sales of assets in the normal course of Borrower's or Guarantor's
business shall be permitted. If any transfer of assets among Borrower and
Guarantors, not in the normal course of business, is contemplated, Lenders must
give prior written approval of same. For purposes of this Section 6.02(C),
"substantial" shall mean ten percent (10%) or more of Borrower's Tangible Net
Worth, calculated on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.

(D) Make any investment in, or purchase any stock or other
securities or evidence of indebtedness of any Person, or place funds on deposit

Agreement shall be made to Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders not later

Agreement provides that Lenders may certify or determine an amount or rate

action on its behalf and to exercise and enforce such rights, powers and duties
as are expressly or by implication delegated to Administrative Agent by the
terms hereof and such rights, powers and duties as are reasonably incidental
thereto.

9.02 Nature of Duties. In respect of its duties and functions
hereunder, Administrative Agent shall be considered to be acting solely as an
agent of Lenders in an administrative capacity only and shall not be deemed to
be a trustee of any Lender or an agent or trustee of Borrower for any purpose.

Agreement.

36

<PAGE>


9.03 No Liability to Borrower. Administrative Agent shall have no
liability or obligation to Borrower as a result of any failure or delay by any
Lender or any other party in performing its respective obligations under this
Agreement.

9.04 Liability. Neither Administrative Agent, in its capacity as
Administrative Agent, nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents
shall be liable for (A) the truth of any representation or warranty made by
Borrower or Guarantors in this Agreement or any other document delivered in
connection with this Agreement, (B) the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement or any such document, (C) any failure of Borrower or Guarantors to
fulfill any of its respective obligations under this Agreement or any such
document or (D) any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with this
Agreement, the Notes, or the Collateral Documents absent gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely in good faith
on any communication or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been
sent or signed by the proper Person or Persons and on the opinions and
statements of any legal counsel or other professional advisors selected by it
and shall not be liable to any other Person for any consequence of any such
reliance.

9.05 Information about Borrower and Guarantors. Each Lender has
investigated and evaluated, and shall continue to investigate and evaluate, the
creditworthiness of Borrower and Guarantors and such other issues and
information as it has judged appropriate and prudent in connection with its
commitment to lend hereunder and the making of its Advances. Except as expressly
provided herein, Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information with respect to Borrower or
Guarantors, whether that information comes into its possession before or after
the disbursement of any Advance; provided, however, that Administrative Agent
shall disseminate all material information received by it from the Borrower or
any Guarantor to Lenders.

the Collateral Documents; provided, however, that Administrative Agent shall

receives actual notice in its capacity as an Administrative Agent hereunder.

9.07 Covenant to Reimburse. Each Lender shall reimburse Administrative
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower or Guarantors) on demand for
that Lender's pro rata share of all expenses incurred by Administrative Agent in
the exercise of its responsibilities hereunder including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and expenses of legal and other professional advisors,
except to the extent that such expenses are incurred as a result of
Administrative Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

9.08 Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative Agent. Unless
Administrative Agent has received written notice from Borrower before the date
on which Borrower is required hereunder to make a payment to Administrative
Agent that Borrower does not intend to make that payment as and when due,
Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has so made that payment and

37

<PAGE>


may (but shall not be required to) make available to Lenders on the date that
payment is due an amount equal to that payment. If Borrower has not in fact made
that payment to Administrative Agent, each Lender shall, on demand, repay to
Administrative Agent the amount so made available to it, together with interest
on that amount accrued for each day from and including that payment date to but
excluding the date of repayment at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds
Rate for that date. On the date of disbursement of an Advance or issuance of a
Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that each
Lender (other than any Lender that has given Administrative Agent notice to the
contrary) has made funds available to Administrative Agent as required
hereunder, and Administrative Agent may (but shall not be required to) credit
funds to Borrower in an amount equal to the aggregate of the principal amount of
Advances to be made on that date by all Lenders from which no such notice has
been received. If any Lender that has not given that notice fails to make funds
available as required hereunder and Administrative Agent has credited to
Borrower an amount equal to that aggregate, Administrative Agent shall be
entitled at its option to recover from either that Lender or Borrower, on
demand, an amount equal to the Advance that was to have been made by that Lender
on that date, together with interest on that amount accrued for each day from
and including the applicable date of the Advance to but excluding the date of
that recovery at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate for that day.

its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
all or a portion of its Commitment, the pro rata amount of Advances owing to it

assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights
and obligations under this Agreement, (ii) except in the case of an assignment
to a person that, immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an
assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the
amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each
such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than Three Million US
Dollars ($3,000,000.00) or an integral multiple of One Million US Dollars
($1,000,000.00) in excess thereof, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an
Eligible Assignee, and (iv) the parties to each such assignment shall execute

warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or

value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created
or purported to be created under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning
Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to the financial condition of Borrower or the performance or observance
by Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms
that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the
Financial Statements and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such

take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
this Agreement as are delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms hereof,

Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and Borrower,
Administrative Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(D) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an

accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice to Lenders and
Borrower or be removed only with cause by Majority Lenders by notice to
Administrative Agent. Upon the giving of either such notice, Majority Lenders

appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder and notice of that acceptance to
Lenders and Borrower, the successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent (as Administrative Agent and not as Lender), and the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from any further duties or
obligations as Administrative Agent under this Agreement. The provisions of this
Article shall continue to inure to the benefit of Administrative Agent that has
resigned or been removed in respect of any action taken or not taken by it as
Administrative Agent hereunder.


X.       INDEMNITIES, SET-OFF AND PRO RATA SHARING

10.01. Commitments; Pro Rata Amounts. Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender of each Request for Advance and Request for Letter
of Credit. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each Lender shall make
available its Pro Rata Share in the relevant Advance or Letter of Credit in
accordance with Sections 2.01, 2.07, 3.02 and 8.01.

10.02 General Indemnity. Borrower and each Guarantor shall indemnify
Administrative Agent and each Lender and hold Administrative Agent and each
Lender and their respective successors and assigns absolutely harmless from and
against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses or obligations which
Administrative Agent or such Lender may incur as a consequence of any Event of
Default or any other breach by Borrower or any Guarantor of any of their
obligations under this Agreement, any Note, Collateral Document or any Guarantee
or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, except to the extent that such
losses, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses or obligations shall result from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Administrative Agent or such
Lender. Without intending to limit the remedies available to Lenders with
respect to the enforcement of their indemnification rights as stated herein or
as stated in any Collateral Document (other than, and to the extent of, any
claim or demand resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Administrative Agent or a Lender), in the event any claim or demand is made or
any other fact comes to the attention of a Lender in connection with, relating

40

<PAGE>


or pertaining to, or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which Lenders believe might in any manner result in the liability of
Lenders, Borrower and Guarantors shall, immediately upon receipt of written
notification of any such claim or demand, assume in full the personal
responsibility for and the defense of any such claim or demand and pay in
connection therewith any loss damage, deficiency, liability or obligation,
including without limitation, legal fees and court costs incurred in connection
therewith prior to the institution of legal proceedings, at all trial levels and
levels of appeal. In the event of court action in connection with any such claim
or demand, Borrower and Guarantors shall assume in full the responsibility for
the defense of any such action and shall immediately satisfy and discharge any
final decree or judgment rendered therein. Lenders may, at their sole
discretion, make any payments sustained or incurred by reason of the foregoing,
and Borrower and Guarantors shall immediately repay to Lenders in cash the
amount of such payment, with interest thereon at the maximum lawful rate from
the date of such payment. Lenders shall have the right to join Borrower and/or
any Guarantor as a party defendant in any legal action brought against them, and
Borrower and each Guarantor hereby consents to the entry of any order making it
a party defendant to any such action.

10.03 Set-Off. If an Event of Default has occurred, each Lender shall
have the right, without notice to Borrower or any other Person, to set-off and
apply any credit balance on any account (whether subject to notice or not and
whether matured or not and in whatever currency) of Borrower or of any Guarantor
with such Lender or any affiliate thereof, and any other Indebtedness owing by
such Lender or other affiliate to Borrower or such Guarantor, against the
liabilities of Borrower or such Guarantor under this Agreement. Each Lender
shall forthwith notify each other Lender of any exercise of its rights under
this Section. This Section shall not affect any general or banker's Lien, right
of set-off or other right to which any Lender may be entitled.

10.04 Pro Rata Sharing. Except as set forth in Section 1.06 of the
Second Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement by and among Lenders of even
date herewith as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Intercreditor
Agreement"), if at any time any Lender receives any amount in respect of sums
due from Borrower under this Agreement whether by way of voluntary or
involuntary payment, set-off or otherwise, it will promptly pay the amount so
received to the other Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Share in such amount. Such Lender shall treat such amount as if it were a
payment by Borrower directly to all Lenders on account of sums due from Borrower
hereunder so that, as between Borrower and Lender which originally received the
amount, the amount shall be treated as not having been paid and such Lender
shall retain all its rights against Borrower or otherwise in respect of such
amount (except to the extent of any sum retained by it as its pro rata share).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section:

(A) a Lender shall not be required to share any amount which
it has received as a result of any legal proceedings commenced in order to
recover sums owing to it under this Agreement with any other Lender which has a
legal right to but does not join in such legal proceedings after having been
given reasonable opportunity so to do and which does not commence and diligently
pursue separate legal proceedings for that purpose; and

41

<PAGE>


(B) if any Lender is required to repay to Borrower any part of
an amount originally received by it and shared pursuant to this Clause, the
other Lender shall make funds available on a pro rata basis to reimburse such
Lender for the amount required to be repaid (less the appropriate portion of any
sum retained by such Lender in respect of such amount).


XI.      MISCELLANEOUS

11.01 Construction. The provisions of this Agreement shall be in
addition to those of any guarantee, pledge or security agreement, note or other
evidence of liability held by any of Lenders, all of which shall be construed as
complementary to each other. Nothing herein contained shall prevent Lenders from
enforcing any or all other notes, guarantees, pledges or security agreements in
accordance with their respective terms.

11.02 Further Assurance. Borrower hereby agrees that it shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries, present or future, to, from time to time, execute
and deliver to Lenders such additional documents and will provide such
additional information as Lenders may reasonably require to carry out the terms
of this Agreement and be informed of the status and affairs of Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.

11.03 Enforcement and Waiver by Administrative Agent on Behalf of
Lenders. Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders, shall have the right at all
times to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the Notes and the Collateral
Documents in strict accordance with the terms hereof and thereof,
notwithstanding any conduct or custom on the part of Lenders in refraining from
so doing at any time or times. The failure of Administrative Agent on behalf of
Lenders or any Lender at any time or times to enforce their respective rights
under such provisions, strictly in accordance with the same, shall not be
construed as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to specific
provisions of this Agreement, the Notes or the Collateral Documents or as having
in any way or manner modified or waived the same. All rights and remedies of
Lenders are cumulative and concurrent and the exercise of one right or remedy
shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any other right or remedy.

including the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel for Administrative
Agent incurred by Administrative Agent and Lenders and applicable taxes or
charges imposed by any governmental authority, incurred by Administrative Agent
and Lenders in connection with the preparation, administration, amendment and
modification of this Agreement, the Notes and the Collateral Documents. Borrower
further agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of Administrative Agent

expenses), in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations,
legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents
including, without limitation, reasonable fees and

Agreement or by any applicable laws, notice
of any other action taken by Lenders; and

(B) Releases Lenders and their respective officers, attorneys,
agents and employees from all claims for loss or damage caused by any act or
omission on the part of any of them, provided, however, that nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed in any fashion, as a release of Lenders and their
respective officers, attorneys, agents and employees from (1) their contractual
obligations created hereunder and/or pursuant to any other instrument executed
in connection with the Advances, and/or (2) resulting directly from its gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

11.08 Participation. Each Lender may sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (other than the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) in or
to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances

(i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder
of the interest in any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and (v) no participant under any such
participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any Note, or any consent to any departure by the
Borrower therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent
would reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other
amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or postpone

44

<PAGE>


any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any
fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to
such participation.

11.09 Applicable Law. The laws of the State of Florida, excluding its
choice-of-law rules, shall govern the validity, construction and interpretation
of this Agreement, and the rights and remedies of the parties hereto.

11.10 Binding Effect. Assignment and Entire Agreement. This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the respective
successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. Borrower shall not have
the right to assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of Lenders. This Agreement, and the documents executed and
delivered pursuant hereto, constitute the entire Agreement between the parties,
and may be amended only by a writing signed on behalf of each party.

11.11 Superseding Effect of Advance Agreement. The terms and conditions
of that certain Advance commitment letter dated February 11, 1999, from
Administrative Agent to Borrower, shall survive the Closing of this Agreement,
provided, however, that this Agreement shall take precedence over and supersede
any conflicting terms or provisions contained in such letter.

11.12 Funding Losses. If Borrower fails to borrow after a Request for
Advance has been given to Administrative Agent, Borrower shall reimburse Lenders
on demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by Lenders; provided that
Administrative Agent shall have delivered to Borrower a certificate as to the
amount of such loss, which certificate shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

11.13 Increased Costs. If, due to either (i) the introduction of any
law or regulation or any change in, or in the interpretation of, any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) in
either case made subsequent to the date hereof, there shall be any increase in
the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or of making, funding or maintaining
LIBOR based Advances, then Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by any
Lender (with a copy of such demand to Administrative Agent), pay to such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost.
A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost and calculating such
amount in reasonable detail, submitted to Borrower by such Lender (with a copy
to Administrative Agent), shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or
any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law) made subsequent to the date hereof
affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that
the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such
Lender's commitment to lend or to issue Letters of Credit hereunder and other
commitments of such type or the issuance or maintenance of the Letters of Credit
(or similar contingent obligations), then,

45

<PAGE>


upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to Administrative Agent),
Borrower shall pay to such Lender, from time to time as specified by such
Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender in the light of
such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment
to lend or to issue Letters of Credit hereunder or to the issuance or
maintenance of any Letters of Credit hereunder. A certificate as to the amount
of such increased cost and calculating such amount in reasonable detail,
submitted to Borrower by such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent),
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender to perform its
obligations hereunder to make LIBOR based Advances or to continue to fund or
maintain LIBOR Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof, and demand therefor
by such Lender to Borrower, (i) each LIBOR based Advance will automatically,
upon such demand by Lender, convert into an Advance based on the Prime Rate then
currently existing (it being understood that interest on such Advances shall
change with any change in the Prime Rate), and (ii) the obligation of Lenders to
make additional LIBOR based Advances shall be suspended until Lenders notify
Borrower that they have determined that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist.

11.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid under any applicable laws, such invalidity shall not affect any other
provision of this Agreement that can be given effect without the invalid
provision, and, to this end, the provisions hereof are severable.

11.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

11.16 Seal. This Agreement is intended to take effect as an instrument
under seal.

11.17 Communications. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
all communications between Lenders and Borrower in relation to this Agreement
shall be made through Administrative Agent; provided, however, that any
requests, certificates, statements, reports or similar items required to be
provided by Borrower to Lenders shall be provided to each and every Lender.

11.18 Joinder by Guarantors. Guarantors join in the execution of this
Agreement to express their assent to the terms hereof and acknowledge that,
except for the execution and delivery of the Guarantees, the Second Amended
Facility would not be offered by Lenders and that sufficient consideration
exists for each Guarantor to give its Guarantee to Lenders.

11.19 Waiver of Jury Trial. LENDERS, AND THE UNDERSIGNED BORROWER AND
GUARANTORS, HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND

46

<PAGE>


INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT ANY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH,
OR IN RESPECT OF ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER
ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT FOR LENDERS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

11.20 Confidentiality Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall
disclose any information that Borrower furnishes to Administrative Agent or to
any Lender in a writing designated as confidential, (not including any such
information that is or becomes generally available to the public or that is or
becomes available to Administrative Agent or such Lender from a source other
than Borrower or any of its Affiliates) to any other Person without the consent
of Borrower, other than (a) to Administrative Agent's or such Lender's
Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors and to
actual or prospective assignees and participants, and then only on a
confidential basis, (b) as required by any law, rule or regulation or judicial
process and (c) as requested or required by any state, federal or foreign
authority or examiner regulating banks or banking.

11.21 Waivers, Amendments, etc. The provisions of this Agreement, the
Notes, and each Collateral Document may from time to time be amended, modified
or waived, if such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and consented
to by Borrower and Majority Lenders; provided, however, that no such amendment,
modification or waiver which would:

(a) modify any requirement hereunder that any particular
action be taken by all the Lenders or by the Majority Lenders shall be effective
unless consented to by each Lender;

(b) modify this Section 11.21, change the definition of
"Majority Lenders", amend the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, increase any
Commitment or the percentage of any Lender, reduce any fees described herein,
release any collateral security, except as otherwise specifically provided in
any Collateral Document or amend any Guarantee (or release any Guarantor from
its obligations thereunder), or extend any Commitment termination date without
the consent of each Lender;

(c) extend the due date for, or reduce the amount of, any
scheduled repayment or prepayment of principal of or interest on any Advance or
any fee (or reduce the principal amount of or rate of interest on any Advance or
any fee) shall be made without the consent of all Lenders with respect to such
Advance or fee; or

(d) affect adversely the interests, rights or obligations of
Administrative Agent in its capacity as Administrative Agent hereunder, without
consent of Administrative Agent.

No failure or delay on the part of Administrative Agent, any Lender in
exercising any power or right under this Agreement, the Notes, or any Collateral
Document shall operate as a waiver

47

<PAGE>


thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power or right
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
power or right. No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle it
to any notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. No waiver or approval
by Administrative Agent, any Lender under this Agreement or any Collateral
Document shall, except as may be otherwise stated in such waiver or approval, be
applicable to subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval hereunder shall
require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted
hereunder.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this
Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

THIS SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED SECURITY AGREEMENT (the "Security
Agreement"), made this ___ day of April, 1999, by ________________________, a
_________ corporation (hereinafter called the "Debtor"), having its principal
address at _________________________, who, for valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is, hereby, acknowledged, hereby grants to
DRESDNER BANK LATEINAMERIKA AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, Miami Agency, an international
bank agency licensed by the State of Florida, BANK LEUMI USA, a New York banking
corporation, ISRAEL DISCOUNT BANK LIMITED, Miami Agency, an international bank
agency licensed by the State of Florida, (collectively, "Existing Secured

international bank agency licensed by the State of Florida, THE FIRST NATIONAL
BANK OF CHICAGO, a national banking association, FIRST UNION NATIONAL BANK, a

(collectively "New Secured Parties") (Existing Secured Parties and New Secured
Parties together, "Secured Party"), and renews and/or amends, a lien upon and
security interest in the property and any replacements thereof described in
Exhibit "A" attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof as well as
all proceeds therefrom and insurance thereon (said property being hereinafter
called the "Collateral"). All terms not defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned to them under the Second Amended and Restated Facility Agreement of
even date herewith, as amended or modified from time to time (the "Second
Amended Facility Agreement") among the Borrower, the Debtor, the other
Guarantors named therein and the Secured Party.

This Security Agreement is entered into to secure payment of and
performance of any and all of Obligations to Secured Party now or hereafter
existing under the Second Amended Facility Agreement, the Notes, and the other
Collateral Documents thereto of even date herewith as well as any obligations
arising under or in connection with Hedging Instruments entered into from time
to time ("Rate Hedging Obligations" and, together with the "Obligations" the
"Secured Obligations"), and has been amended and restated to provide for, among
other things, the inclusion of New Secured Parties as additional obligees and
for the continuation, amendment and renewal of the Security Agreement between
Existing Secured Parties and Debtor dated as of April 28, 1997 as amended and
restated by that certain Amended and Restated Security Agreement dated April 29,
1998. Any documents including, but not limited to, any notes, mortgages,
security agreements, including Security Agreement, securing or evidencing the
Secured Obligations and are hereinafter collectively called the "Collateral
Documents."

Incident thereto, Debtor agrees with Secured Party as follows:

1.  Debtor warrants and represents that:

(a) Debtor is the lawful owner of such Collateral and has good
right to pledge, sell, assign, co-sign, transfer and create a security interest
in the same;

(b) Debtor will, at Secured Party's request, defend the
Collateral from all claims and demands of all persons;

(c) All tangible Collateral is to be kept at the business to
be maintained at Debtor's principal place of business, and will not be removed
therefrom, except in the ordinary course of business, without the prior written
consent of Secured Party; provided, however, that it may move tangible
Collateral to a location of an affiliate with respect to which Secured Party
also has a perfected security interest in like Collateral; and

(d) Debtor will, at its own cost and expense, keep the
Collateral in as good and substantial repair as the same is in at this date, or
as the same exists when acquired, reasonable wear and tear excepted, making
replacements when and where necessary and, in this connection, Secured Party
hereby agrees that it will give its written consent to the removal by Debtor of
the same, or any part thereof, from the


<PAGE>


above described property if and to the extent that such removal is necessary or
advisable so to do in connection with Debtor's fulfilling of its obligations
under this subparagraph `1', as long as such Collateral is replaced by
Collateral which is unencumbered and of equal value and if, in the opinion of
Secured Party, the priority of its security interest therein will not be
jeopardized.

(e) The Collateral is not subject to any other liens except
the first priority liens in favor of Secured Party set forth herein.

2. Upon request and as instructed by Administrative Agent, Debtor
agrees to comply with the requirements of all applicable state and federal laws
in order to grant to Secured Party a valid lien upon, and a security interest
in, the Collateral described herein, or which may be described in any amendment
supplementary hereto.

3. Debtor will pay, when due, all taxes, assessments, and other charges
lawfully and validly levied or assessed upon the Collateral or any part thereof,
and Debtor will pay any and all fees, costs and expenses, of whatever kind and
nature, which Administrative Agent may incur in filing public notices, and the
reasonable charges of any attorneys whom Administrative Agent may engage in
preparing and filing such documents, making title examinations and rendering
opinion letters, as well as expenses incurred by Administrative Agent, including
reasonable attorney's fees, in protecting, maintaining, preserving, enforcing or
foreclosing the security interest granted to Administrative Agent hereunder,
whether through judicial proceedings or otherwise, or in defending or
prosecuting any actions or proceedings arising out of or relating to this
transaction, promptly after Debtor shall have been notified by Secured Party of
the amount of such fees, costs or expenses.

4. Debtor agrees that Secured Party, or its agents, may enter upon
Debtor's property at any time, and from time to time, for the purpose of
inspecting the Collateral, and any and all records pertaining thereto. Debtor
agrees to promptly notify Administrative Agent of any change in its mailing
address or principal place of business, in order that a prompt refiling of any
outstanding notices may be made, if necessary. Debtor shall also advise
Administrative Agent, within thirty (30) days, of any new facts known to Debtor
which, under the applicable provisions of law, would affect the priority of the
security interest granted to Secured Party by this instrument.

5. Debtor will have and maintain insurance at all times with respect to
all Collateral in types, forms, amounts and in the manner as specified in the
Second Amended Facility Agreement, this Security Agreement and any other
Collateral Document, such insurance to be payable to Administrative Agent on
behalf of Secured Party and Debtor, as their interests may appear. All policies
of insurance shall provide for thirty (30) days written minimum cancellation
notice to Administrative Agent and Debtor shall furnish Administrative Agent
with certificates or other evidence satisfactory to Secured Party of compliance
with the foregoing insurance provisions as set forth herein and in the
Collateral Documents.

6. At its option, Administrative Agent may discharge taxes, liens or
security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the
Collateral, may pay for insurance on the Collateral and may pay for the
maintenance and preservation of the Collateral. All such sums, as well as costs,
advanced by Secured Party pursuant to this Security Agreement shall be due
immediately from Debtor to Secured Party, shall be secured hereby and shall bear
interest at the highest default rate of interest specified in any note or other
agreement evidencing the Secured Obligations and if no such instrument exists,
then at the highest rate allowed by law, from the date of payment by Secured
Party until the date of repayment by Debtor. Until Default, Debtor may have
possession of the Collateral and use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent
with this Security Agreement and not inconsistent with any policy of insurance
thereon.

7. (a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and acceleration of
the Obligations under the Second Amended Facility Agreement or acceleration of
any Rate Hedging Obligation under any Hedging Instruments, Secured Party shall
have the remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as
adopted in Florida. Secured Party may require Debtor to assemble and deliver the
Collateral and make it available to Secured Party at a place to be designated by
Secured Party which is reasonably convenient to

2

<PAGE>


both parties. Administrative Agent on behalf of Secured Party may peaceably, by
its own means or with judicial assistance, enter Debtor's Property and Debtor
will not resist or interfere with such action. Unless the Collateral is
perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is a type customarily
sold on a recognized market, Administrative Agent will give Debtor reasonable
notice of the time and place of any public sale thereof, or of the time after
which any private sale or any other intended disposition thereof is to be made.
The requirements of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is mailed,
postage prepaid, to the address of Debtor shown at the beginning of this
Security Agreement at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or
disposition. Expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling or the
like shall include Secured Party's reasonable attorney's fees and legal
expenses.

(b) In case of the exercise of any of the rights of Secured
Party hereunder, all Collateral, and other property or security given to secure
the indebtedness secured hereby, may be offered for sale for one total price,
and the proceeds of such sale accounted for in one account without distinction
between items of security or without assigning to them any proportion of the
proceeds of such sale, Debtor insofar as it legally may so do hereby waiving the
application of any doctrine of marshalling, or the Collateral, or such other
property or security, may be offered for sale separately, and sales may be held
from time to time, and all powers of Secured Party shall not be fully executed
until all Collateral, and such other property or security, shall have been sold.

(c) any proceeds derived from the sale or disposition of any
Collateral shall be distributed as follows:

(i) first, to the payment of any expenses of Secured
Party in the enforcement of its rights hereunder;

(ii) second, for the payment of fees due under the
Second Amended Facility Agreement;

(iii) third, to the payment of any accrued interest
and/or penalties payable to Lenders;

(iv) fourth, to the payment of the principal amount
of any outstanding Advances and outstanding Rate Hedging Obligations pari passu;

(v) fifth, any other Secured Obligation including,
without limitation, obligations under Letters of Credit that are not yet
outstanding; and

(vi) sixth, to Debtor, or as a court of competent
jurisdiction may decide.

8. No waiver by Secured Party of any default shall operate as a waiver
of any other default or of the same default on a future occasion. All rights of
Secured Party hereunder shall inure to the benefit of its successors and
assigns; and all obligations of Debtor shall bind its successors and assigns. If
there be more than one Debtor, their obligations hereunder shall be joint and
several.

9. The covenants and agreements herein contained shall extend to, inure
to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the respective successors and assigns of
the parties hereto, the same as if they were in every case named and expressed.

10. Debtor covenants and agrees to execute such financing statements,
security agreements or other instruments with respect to the Collateral as
Administrative Agent or any Lender may request, and hereby authorizes
Administrative Agent or any Lender to execute and file, at any time, such
financing statements without Debtor's signature. Debtor agrees that
Administrative Agent or any Lender may file this Security Agreement in lieu of
any such financing statement.

11. This Security Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to any
choice of law principles.

THE PARTIES HERETO KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE
RIGHT EITHER MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED
HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT
AND ANY AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONJUNCTION HEREWITH, OR ANY

following the date this Guarantee was so cancelled, and Guarantor
was obligated under this Guarantee for said payments, the liability
of Guarantor hereunder shall at all times continue for the amounts
so paid by Borrower to Lenders. If, for any reason (e.g.
bankruptcy, or otherwise), Lenders are not permitted to retain the
payments so made by Borrower during said one (1) year period,
Guarantor shall be liable under this Guarantee for the amount of
such payments as if this Guarantee had never been cancelled and
Lenders shall be entitled to recover said amount so paid by
Borrower within said one (1) year period. Anything in this
Guarantee to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time this
Guarantee is to be cancelled under the provisions of paragraph 3,
Lenders may retain this Guarantee for a period of one hundred
twenty (120) days after the date said Guarantee is to be so
cancelled and in the event no bankruptcy petition has been filed by
or against Borrower for the one (1) year period following the date
the Guarantee is to be cancelled, then, in that event, the
Guarantee shall be returned to Guarantor. If, however, a bankruptcy
petition has been filed by or against Borrower during the one (1)
year period, and Borrower has made payments to Lenders during the
one (1) year period, this Guarantee shall not be cancelled and/or
returned to Guarantor unless and until a decision by a court of
competent jurisdiction, or other agreement has been entered or
reached, pursuant to which Lenders shall be entitled to retain all
such monies paid during the one (1) year period. If, as set forth
above, Lenders are obligated to return to Borrower any monies so
paid during the one (1) year period, this Guarantee shall not be
cancelled (notwithstanding it being marked "Cancelled" and returned
to Guarantor) and Guarantor shall continue to be liable to Lenders
for all monies paid during the one (1) year period. If Lenders
shall have marked this Guarantee "Cancelled" and/or returned this
Guarantee to Guarantor, and under the provisions of

2

<PAGE>


this paragraph 4 or paragraph 3, Guarantor has continuing liability
to Lenders for certain amounts which Lenders have or are
obligated to return to Borrower, then, in such case, Lenders may
enforce their rights under this Guarantee upon any copy of this
Guarantee notwithstanding the fact that the original of this
Guarantee may have been marked "Cancelled" and/or returned to
Guarantor.

5. CONSENT TO LENDERS' ACTS.

Guarantor consents, without affecting in any way Guarantor's
liability to Lenders hereunder, that Lenders may, without notice to
or consent of Guarantor and upon such terms as they may deem
advisable and with or without consideration and after notice of
cancellation is received by Lenders under paragraph 3 hereof: (a)
extend, in whole or in part, by renewal or otherwise, and as often
as Lenders may wish, the time of payment of any indebtedness owing
by Borrower, to Lenders, or held by Lenders as security for any
such obligation; (b) release, surrender, exchange, modify, impair,
or extend the period of duration, or the time for performance of
payment, of any collateral securing any obligation of Borrower to
Lenders; (c) settle or compromise any claim of Lenders against
Borrower, or against any other person, firm or corporation, whose
obligation is held by Lenders as collateral security for any
obligation of Borrower to Lenders; and (d) release in whole or in
part any person liable for the payment of any obligation of
Borrower to Lenders including, but not limited to, any person
liable as an endorser, guarantor or judgment debtor (if Lenders
obtain a judgment on any obligation of Borrower) of said obligation
and, in any event, any such release shall not affect the liability
of Guarantor for the entire amount of any and every obligation of
Borrower to Lenders. Further, Lenders shall not be under any
obligation whatsoever to obtain or perfect or to maintain the
perfection of any security interest or other lien on property to
secure indebtedness of Borrower to Lenders and Lenders shall have
no obligation to, and shall not have any liability for failing to,
obtain or perfect or to maintain the perfection of any security
interest or lien on property to secure indebtedness of Borrower.
Any failure of Lenders to obtain and perfect or to maintain the
perfection of any security interest or lien shall not affect in any
way whatsoever the obligation of Guarantor to Lenders under this
Guarantee. Guarantor hereby ratifies and confirms any such
extension, renewal, release surrender, exchange, modification,
impairment, settlement, or compromise, and all such actions shall
be binding upon Guarantor who hereby waives all defenses,
counterclaims, or offsets which Guarantor might have by reason
thereof.

6. WAIVERS BY GUARANTOR.

Guarantor waives: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guarantee by
Lenders; (b) notice of presentment, demand for payment, notice of
dishonor or protest of any of Borrower's obligations or the
obligation of any person, firm, or corporation held by Lenders as
collateral security for Borrower's obligation; (c) notice of the
failure of any person, firm, or corporation to pay to Lenders any
indebtedness held by Lenders as collateral security for any
obligation of Borrower; (d) failure of Lenders to obtain and
perfect or maintain the perfection or priority of any security
interest or lien on property to secure any indebtedness of
Borrower; and (e) all defenses, offsets and counterclaims which
Guarantor may at any time have to any claim of Lenders against
Borrower.

7. SUBROGATION.

Nothing herein contained is intended or shall be construed to give
to Guarantor any right of subrogation in or under any note,
security document or any other loan document evidencing in any way
or relating to any obligation of Borrower to Lenders which is or
may be covered by this Guarantee, any right to participate in any
way therein, or in the right, title and interest of Lenders

3

<PAGE>


in or to any collateral covered by any loan or security documents
relating to any such obligations notwithstanding any payments made
by Guarantor under this Guarantee, all such rights of subrogation
and participation being hereby expressly waived and released.


8. SUBORDINATION.

In the event that for any reason whatsoever, Borrower is now or
hereafter becomes indebted to Guarantor, Guarantor agrees that the
amount of such indebtedness and all interest thereon shall at all
times be subordinate as to lien, time of payment and in all other
respects to all obligations of Borrower to Lenders which are
covered by this Guarantee, and that Guarantor shall not be entitled
to enforce or receive payment thereof until all sums then due and
owing to Lenders shall have been paid in full. If any payment shall
have been made to Guarantor by Borrower on any said indebtedness
during any time that there are obligations outstanding from
Borrower to Lenders which are covered by this Guarantee, Guarantor
shall hold in trust all such payments for the benefit of Lenders
and shall make said payments to Lenders to be credited and applied
against obligations of Borrower to Lenders, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the discretion of Lenders.

9. REPRESENTATIONS BY GUARANTOR.

Guarantor represents and warrants that:

(i) at the time of the execution and delivery of this Guarantee,
nothing exists to impair the effectiveness of the liability of
Guarantor to Lenders hereunder, or the immediate taking effect of
this Guarantee as the sole agreement between Guarantor and Lenders
with respect to guaranteeing Borrower's obligation to Lenders;

(ii) it is in the best interest of Guarantor to execute this
Guarantee inasmuch as Guarantor will derive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the Advances made from time to time to
Borrower by Lenders pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated
Facility Agreement of even date herewith (the "Second Amended
Facility Agreement"); and

(iii) all representations and warranties contained in Article V of
the Second Amended Facility Agreement, insofar as the
representations and warranties contained therein are applicable to
Guarantor and its properties, are true and correct in all material
respects, each such representation and warranty set forth in such
Article (insofar as applicable to Guarantor) and all other terms of
the Second Amended Facility Agreement to which reference is made
therein, together with all related definitions and ancillary
provisions, being hereby incorporated herein by reference as though
specifically set forth in this Section.

10. REMEDIES OF LENDERS.

Lenders may at their option proceed in the first instance against
Guarantor to collect any obligation covered by this Guarantee,
without first proceeding against Borrower for said obligation, or
any other person, firm or corporation liable for said obligation,
and without first resorting to any property at any time held by
Lenders as collateral security for said obligation and without any
marshalling of assets whatsoever. Guarantor hereby confirms the
grant of the security interest granted under that certain Amended
and Restated Security Agreement of even date herewith among
Guarantor and Lenders as secured parties under the Second Amended

4

<PAGE>


and Restated Credit Facility Agreement of even date herewith among
Borrower, the guarantors named therein and Lenders.

11. CONSTRUCTION AND BENEFIT.

This Guarantee is delivered and made in, and shall be construed
pursuant to and governed by, the laws of the State of Florida, and
is binding upon Guarantor and its legal representatives and
successors, and shall inure to the benefit of Lenders, their
respective successors and assigns.

12. MISCELLANEOUS.

In the event it becomes necessary for Lenders to exercise their
rights under this Guarantee, whether suit be brought or not,
Guarantor shall be liable for all costs and attorneys' fees
incurred by Lenders, including costs and attorneys' fees incurred
by Lenders on appeal. To the extent Guarantor is obligated to make
any payments to Lenders under this Guarantee, Lenders may offset
and retain in payment of said amounts any and all monies of
Guarantor in the possession of any of Lenders or any of their
affiliates at any time, including, but not limited to, any accounts
of Guarantor at any of Lenders. In the further event Lenders obtain
a final judgment against Guarantor upon this Guarantee, the
judgment shall bear interest not at the judgment rate but at the
highest rate permitted by applicable law from time to time in
effect at the time of said judgment. Further, Guarantor agrees that
the proper venue for any action which may be brought under this
Guarantee, in addition to any other venue permitted by law, shall
be in the county in which is located Lenders' business office as
designated above or the office of an assignee of this Guarantee.
The liability of Guarantor hereunder, if more than one, shall be
joint and several. The term "Lenders" shall be deemed to include
the aforementioned Lenders and all their respective departments and
any individual, partnership or corporation acting as their nominee
or agent, and any of their respective corporate subsidiaries or
affiliates, the stock of which is owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by it or by any affiliate of any of Lenders. The term
"Borrower" shall include the individual or individuals,
association, partnership, corporation or other entity named herein
as Borrower and (a) any successor individual or individuals,
association, partnership, corporation or other entity to which all
or substantially all of the business or assets of said Borrower
shall have been transferred, (b) in the case of a partnership
Borrower, any new partnership which shall have been created by
reason of the admission of any new partner or partners therein
and/or the dissolution of the existing partnership by the death,
resignation or other withdrawal of any partner, and (c) in the case
of a corporate Borrower, any other corporation into or with which
said Borrower shall have been merged, consolidated, reorganized,
purchased or absorbed.

13. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

At the request of Lenders, Guarantor shall, from time to time,
prepare and deliver to Lenders a complete and current financial
statement of Guarantor setting forth all the assets and liabilities
of Guarantor (and to the extent any person other than Guarantor has
any interest in said assets or any person other than Guarantor is
jointly liable for any of said obligation, said matters shall be
set forth in their entirety in the financial statements) all signed
by Guarantor under oath as being true and correct. To the extent
any assets or liabilities set forth on said financial statement are
owned by Guarantor for which there is any such joint liability, all
said assets shall be so specified and set forth.

14. COMPLETE AGREEMENT.

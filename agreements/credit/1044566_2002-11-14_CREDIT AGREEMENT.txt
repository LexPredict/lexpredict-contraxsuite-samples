shall specify the amount of any such reduction; provided, however, that
any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan prior to the last day of the applicable
LIBOR Interest Period shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of
Section 3.4 and the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be
reduced below the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Advances.

2.6. MINIMUM AMOUNT OF EACH ADVANCE; LIMIT ON INTEREST PERIODS. Each
LIBOR Loan shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 (and in multiples of
$1,000,000 if in excess thereof). Each Floating Rate Loan shall be in the
minimum amount of $1,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 if in excess
thereof); provided, however, that any Floating Rate Advance may be in the amount
of the unused Revolving Credit Commitment. No more than twelve (12) LIBOR
Interest Periods for LIBOR Loans may be outstanding at any one time.

<PAGE>

2.7. AUTOMATIC REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. If, on or before November 30,
2002, the Administrative Agent either (i) has not successfully syndicated not
less than $15,000,000 of the Aggregate Commitments or (ii) elected, in its sole
discretion, not to retain 100% of the Aggregate Commitment of $65,000,000, the
Aggregate Commitment shall be automatically and permanently reduced by
$15,000,000 on December 2, 2002, and the Borrower agrees on such date that it
shall immediately repay its then outstanding Loans in an amount necessary to
effect such reduction.

2.8. OPTIONAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. The Borrower may from time to time
pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Loans, or, in a minimum
aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof, any portion of the outstanding Loans upon three Business Days' prior
notice to the Administrative Agent. Any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan prior to the
last day of the applicable LIBOR Interest Period shall be subject to the
indemnity provisions of Section 3.4.

2.9. MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. If at any time the aggregate principal
balance of the Loans exceeds the Aggregate Commitment, the Borrower shall repay
immediately its then outstanding Loans in such amount as may be necessary to
eliminate such excess.

2.10. INTEREST RATE, ETC. Each Floating Rate Loan shall bear interest
at the Floating Rate on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each day
from and including the date such Loan is made or is converted from a LIBOR Loan
into a Floating Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.3.3 to but excluding the date it
becomes due or is converted into a LIBOR Loan pursuant to Section 2.3.3 hereof,
at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day. Each LIBOR Loan
shall bear interest from and including the first day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such LIBOR Interest
Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such LIBOR Loan.

2.11. RATES APPLICABLE AFTER DEFAULT. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 2.3.2 or 2.3.3, no Loans may be made as, converted
into or continued as a LIBOR Loan (except with the consent of the Required
Lenders) when any Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing.
During the continuance of a Default, the Required Lenders may, at their option,
by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that
each LIBOR Loan and Floating Rate Loan shall bear interest for the remainder of
the applicable Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base
Rate plus 2% per annum.

2.12. INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE IN EVENT OF SYNDICATION. If, in order to
facilitate a successful syndication of not less than $15,000,000 of the
Aggregate Commitment on or before November 30, 2002, the Administrative Agent
determines that changes to the terms of this Agreement are advisable, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled, after consultation with the Borrower, to
change any or all of the structure, terms or pricing hereof; provided, that any
increase in the pricing shall not exceed 0.25%; provided, further, that any
change in the structure or terms of the Credit Agreement (other than pricing)
shall require the prior written consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

2.13. METHOD OF PAYMENT. All payments of the Obligations hereunder
shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation
of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to
the Borrower, by 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date when due. Each payment by
the Borrower on account of principal or interest on the Loans shall be applied
ratably among the Lenders by the Administrative Agent according to the
respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then due and owing to the
Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of
any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such
Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its
address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation
specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender. The
Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower
maintained with LaSalle for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it
becomes due hereunder.

2.14. TELEPHONIC NOTICES. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders
and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Loans, effect
selections of Types of Loans and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices
made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good
faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower. The Borrower agrees to
deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation, if such
confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, of each
telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation
differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall govern absent manifest error.

2.15. INTEREST PAYMENT DATES; INTEREST AND FEE BASIS. Interest accrued
on each Floating Rate Loan shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which a
Floating Rate Loan is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and at
maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount
of any Floating Rate Loan converted into a LIBOR Loan on a day other than a
Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on
each LIBOR Loan shall be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest
Period, on any date on which the LIBOR Loan is prepaid, whether by acceleration
or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each LIBOR Loan having an
Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day
of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Facility fees shall be
calculated on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year. All interest in respect of
LIBOR Loans shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a
360-day year. All interest in respect of Floating Rate Loans by reference to the
Alternate Base Rate shall be calculated on a 365 or 366-day year basis, except
that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the
Alternate Base Rate is based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be
calculated on a 360-day year basis for actual days elapsed, as applicable.
Interest shall be payable for the day an Loan is made but not for the day of any
payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 1:00 p.m. (Chicago
time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an
Loan shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall
be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal
payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment.



19
<PAGE>

2.16. NOTIFICATION OF ADVANCES, INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENTS AND
COMMITMENT REDUCTIONS. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent
will notify each Lender of the contents of each Revolving Credit Commitment or
Term Loan Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation
Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent
will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each LIBOR Loan
promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender
prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.

2.17. LENDING INSTALLATIONS. Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and any promissory notes issued to a Lender hereunder
shall be deemed held by such Lender for the benefit of such Lending
Installation. Each Lender may, by written or telecopy notice to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, designate a Lending Installation through
which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be
made.

2.18. NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Unless the
Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent
prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative
Agent of (a) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (b) in the case
of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.
The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of
such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such
assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact
made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment
shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent
the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each
day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available
by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers
such amount at a rate per annum equal to (a) in the case of payment by a Lender,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (b) in the case of payment by
the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

2.19. TAXES.

(a) Any payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement
shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding
for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or
assessed by any Governmental Authority, excluding taxes upon the
overall net income of any Lender or applicable Lending Installation
imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender or Lending
Installation is incorporated or has its principal place of business. If
any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees
deductions or withholdings ("NON-EXCLUDED Taxes") are required to be
withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or
such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to



20
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all
Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable
hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in or pursuant to
this Agreement; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be
required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not
organized under the laws of the U.S. or a state thereof if such Lender
fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this
subsection 2.17. Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the
Borrower, as promptly as practicable thereafter the Borrower shall send
to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of
such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original
official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If
the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the
appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative
Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the
Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for
any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by
any Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.
The agreements in this subsection 2.17 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b) At least five Business Days prior to the first date on
which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any
Lender, each Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to
each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed
copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224,
certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a
Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent two additional copies of such form (or a
successor form) on or before the date that such form expires
(currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one
calendar year for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so
delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals
thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is
entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless any
change in treaty, law or regulation (and not a change in the Lender's
business, operations or place of business or incorporation) has
occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise
be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form
with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments
without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income
tax.

(c) Any stamp, documentary or similar taxes or charges payable
or ruled payable by any Governmental Authority in respect of the Loan
Documents shall be paid by the Borrower, together with interest and
penalties, if any.

2.20. EVIDENCE OF DEBT.




21
<PAGE>

(a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Advance made by such
Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and
paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which
it shall record (i) the amount of each Advance made hereunder, the Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of
any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable
from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any
sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of
the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

(c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of
the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
obligation of the Borrower to repay the Advances in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

(d) Any Lender may request that Advances made by it be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall
prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable
to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such
Lender and its registered assigns) in the form of Revolving Note
attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and Term Note attached hereto as Exhibit
"B", in each case as approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter,
the Loans evidenced by such promissory notes and interest thereon shall
at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be
represented by one or more promissory notes (payable to the order of
each Lender holding a portion of such Loans or, if such promissory note
is a registered note, to such Lender and its registered assigns).

ARTICLE III

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

3.1. YIELD PROTECTION. If, after the date hereof, the adoption of or
any change in any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law), or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or the
compliance of any Lender therewith,

(a) subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
to any tax, duty, charge or withholding on or from payments due from
the Borrower (excluding taxation of the overall net income of any
Lender or applicable Lending Installation imposed by the jurisdiction
in which such Lender or Lending Installation is incorporated or has its
principal place of business), or changes the basis of taxation of
principal, interest or any other payments to any Lender or Lending
Installation in respect of its LIBOR Loans or other amounts due it
hereunder with respect to its LIBOR Loans, or



22
<PAGE>

(b) with respect to LIBOR Loans, imposes or increases or deems
applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit
or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending
Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into account in
determining the interest rate applicable to LIBOR Loans), or

(c) imposes any other condition the result of which is to
increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
of making, funding or maintaining LIBOR Loans or reduces any amount
receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in
connection with LIBOR Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable
Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by reference to the
amount of LIBOR Loans held or interest received by it in respect
thereof,

and, in the case of any of Section 3.1(a), (b) or (c), the Lender shall in good
faith determine the amount of such increased expense incurred or reduction in
amount received to be material, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender,
the Borrower shall pay such Lender that portion of such increased expense
incurred or reduction in an amount received (other than any such expense or
reduction for which the Lenders are also entitled to compensation pursuant to
Section 2.17(a)) which such Lender determines is attributable to making, funding
and maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.

3.2. CHANGES IN CAPITAL ADEQUACY REGULATIONS. If a Lender determines in
good faith that the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender is increased by an amount deemed material by such Lender
as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the
Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any
shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which
such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its
obligation to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's
policies as to capital adequacy).

3.3. AVAILABILITY OF TYPES OF LOANS. If any Lender determines in good
faith that maintenance of any of its LIBOR Loans at a suitable Lending
Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or directive,
whether or not having the force of law, the Administrative Agent shall suspend
the availability of the affected Type of Loan and require any LIBOR Loans to be
repaid or converted into a Floating Rate Loans within five (5) days after
Borrower's receipt of notice by such Lender; or if the Required Lenders
determine that (a) deposits of a type or maturity appropriate to match fund
LIBOR Loans are not available, or (b) the interest rate applicable to a Type of
Loan does not accurately or fairly reflect the cost of making or maintaining
such Loan, then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of the
affected Type of Loan and require any LIBOR Loans of the affected Type to be
repaid.

3.4. FUNDING INDEMNIFICATION. If any payment of a LIBOR Loan occurs on
a date which is not the last day of the applicable LIBOR Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a LIBOR Loan is not
made, continued or converted on the date specified by the Borrower for any
reason other than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each
Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom,


23
<PAGE>

including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing
deposits acquired to fund or maintain the LIBOR Loan.

3.5. LENDER STATEMENTS; SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITY. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its LIBOR Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 or to avoid the unavailability of a Type of
Loan under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to
such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any,
under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4. Such written statement shall set forth in
reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount
and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of
manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in
connection with a LIBOR Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded
its LIBOR Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity
corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the LIBOR Rate
applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless
otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any
Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of the written
statement. The obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall
survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

3.6. RIGHT TO SUBSTITUTE LENDER. Any Lender claiming any additional
amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2 or unable to make a Type of Loan
available in accordance with Section 3.3, shall, so long as no Default or
Unmatured Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the written request of
the Borrower delivered to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, assign,
pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.3, all of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the Loan Documents to
another Lender or to a commercial bank, other financial institution, commercial
finance company or other institutional lender selected by the Borrower and
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent that has agreed not to claim
any additional amounts under Section 3.1 or 3.2 with respect to some or all of
the taxes or regulatory changes that gave rise to such assigning Lender's claim
for such compensation, or that has agreed to make the Type of Loan available
that was not made available from such assigning Lender, in consideration for (a)
the payment by such assignee to such assigning Lender of the principal of, and
interest accrued and unpaid to the date of such assignment on, the Loans held by
such assigning Lender, (b) the payment by the Borrower to such assigning Lender
of any and all other amounts owing to such assigning Lender under any provision
of this Agreement accrued and unpaid to the date of such assignment and (c) the
Borrower's release of such assigning Lender from any further obligation or
liability under this Agreement and the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Section 3.6, in no event shall the replacement
of any Lender result in a decrease or reallocation of the Aggregate Commitments
without the prior written consent of each of the remaining Lenders.

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

5.1. CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND STANDING. Each of the Borrower and each
Significant Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing (if applicable) under the laws of its respective jurisdiction
of incorporation and is duly qualified and in good standing (if applicable) as a
foreign corporation and is duly authorized to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted and in which the failure to be
so qualified or authorized may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

5.2. AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The Borrower has all requisite power
and authority (corporate and otherwise) and legal right to execute and deliver
each of the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder. The
execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan

26
<PAGE>

Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly
authorized by proper corporate proceedings and the Loan Documents constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the
Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally.

5.3. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND CONTRACTS. The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, judgments, decrees and restrictions, including, without limitation, all
Environmental Laws, of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective
Properties, except where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the execution and delivery
by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, the application of the proceeds of the
Loans, the consummation of the Closing Transactions or any other transaction
contemplated in the Loan Documents, nor compliance with the provisions of the
Loan Documents will, or at the relevant time did, (a) violate any law, rule,
regulation (including Regulations U or X), order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree or award binding on the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the Borrower's or
any Subsidiary's charter, articles or certificate of incorporation or by-laws,
(b) violate the provisions of or require the approval or consent of any party to
any indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary
is a party or is subject, or by which it or its Property is bound, or conflict
with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien (other than Liens permitted by, the Loan Documents) in, of or on the
Property of the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such
indenture, instrument or agreement, or (c) require any consent of the
stockholders of any Person, except for approvals or consents which have been
obtained at or before the time of the initial Advance and are disclosed on
Schedule 5.3 and except for any violation of, or failure to obtain an approval
or consent required under, any such indenture, instrument or agreement which
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.4. GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. Except for any of the following which have
been entered, taken, obtained, filed or made and which remain in full force and
effect or which if not entered, taken, obtained or filed could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no order, consent, approval,
qualification, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or
registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of, any court,
Governmental Authority, any securities exchange or other Person is or at the
relevant time was required to authorize, or is or at the relevant time was
required in connection with the execution, delivery, consummation or performance
of, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of, any of the
Loan Documents, the application of the proceeds of the Loans or any other
transaction contemplated in the Loan Documents.

5.5. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Borrower has heretofore furnished to
each of the Lenders (a) the December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 audited
annual financial statements, and (b) the June 30, 2002 unaudited quarterly
financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the

ARTICLE VIII

ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

8.1. ACCELERATION. If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7
occurs with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make
Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the
Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required
Lenders) may terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder, or declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon
the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby
expressly waives.

8.2. AMENDMENTS. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the
Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the
Required Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto
for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or
changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or
thereunder or waiving any Default hereunder or thereunder; provided, however,
that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each Lender:

(a) extend the Revolving Loan Termination Date or the Term
Loan Termination Date or the final maturity of any Loan or reduce the
principal amount thereof or reduce the rate or extend the time of
payment of any interest or any fee payable hereunder;

(b) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Lenders;

(c) increase the amount of the Aggregate Commitment or the
Commitment of any Lender hereunder;

(d) permit the Borrower to assign its rights under this
Agreement; or

(e) amend this Section 8.2.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Administrative
Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent may waive payment of the fee required under
Section 12.3.1 without obtaining the consent of any other party to this
Agreement.

8.3. PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Unmatured Default or
an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence
of a Default or Unmatured Default or the inability of the Borrower to satisfy
the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any



40
<PAGE>

waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall
not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing
signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the
extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the
Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available
to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been paid
in full.

ARTICLE IX

9.1. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS. All representations and warranties of
the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making of the Loans

obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender

confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.

(each such Person being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred
by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by

consummation of the Closing Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom
or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract,
tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a
party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee,
on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or

9.8. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that



42
<PAGE>

jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in
any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are
declared to be severable.

9.9. NONLIABILITY OF LENDERS. The relationship between the Borrower and
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be solely that of borrower and
lender. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary
responsibilities to the Borrower. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the
Borrower of any matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's business
or operations.

9.10. CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A
CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, BUT
GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

9.11. JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS.

(a) BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE

THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER
INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT
OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT
ONLY IN A COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

10.1. APPOINTMENT. LaSalle Bank National Association is hereby
appointed Administrative Agent for the Lenders hereunder and under each other
Loan Document, and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Administrative

Administrative Agent shall not have a fiduciary relationship in respect of the
Borrower or any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

10.2. POWERS. The Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise such
powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no
implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any
action thereunder, except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents
to be taken by the Administrative Agent.

10.3. GENERAL IMMUNITY. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower or any
Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except for
its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

10.4. NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOANS, RECITALS, ETC. Neither the

the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly
to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV,
except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent and
not waived at closing; or (d) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness,
sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or
writing furnished in connection therewith. The Administrative Agent shall have
no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not required to be
furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at such time, but is
voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent (either in its
capacity as Administrative Agent or in its individual capacity) and which is not
otherwise expressly required by this Agreement to be delivered by the
Administrative Agent to the Lenders.

10.5. ACTION ON INSTRUCTIONS OF LENDERS. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written
instructions signed by the Required Lenders (or, to the extent required by

failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action hereunder and under any other



45
<PAGE>

Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders pro-rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may
incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

10.6. EMPLOYMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS AND COUNSEL. The
Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as Administrative Agent
hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents, and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except as to money
or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its duties
hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

10.7. RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS; COUNSEL. The Lenders agree that the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement, paper or document believed
by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper
person or persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel
selected by the Administrative Agent, which counsel may be employees of the
Administrative Agent.

10.8. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION. The
Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably in
proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been
terminated, in proportion to their Commitments immediately prior to such
termination) (a) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the
Administrative Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan
Documents, (b) to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower, for any other
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and
enforcement of the Loan Documents and (c) to the extent not reimbursed by the

judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents
or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions
contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the terms thereof or of any
such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the
foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Administrative Agent as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8
shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

10.9. NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured
Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice
from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such
Default or Unmatured Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.



46
<PAGE>

10.10. RIGHTS AS A LENDER. In the event the Administrative Agent is a
Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder
and under any other Loan Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders"
shall, at any time when the Administrative Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual
capacity. The Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such
Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The
Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a
Lender.

10.11. LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

10.12. SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the
Borrower, such resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor
Administrative Agent or, if no successor Administrative Agent has been
appointed, thirty days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of
its intention to resign. Upon any such resignation and with the consent of the
Borrower (so long as no Default is then pending), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Required Lenders shall have the right to
appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative
Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty days
after the resigning Administrative Agent's giving notice of its intent to
resign, then the resigning Administrative Agent may appoint, on behalf of the
Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent has resigned and no successor Administrative Agent has been
appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations
to the applicable Lenders and for all other purposes shall deal directly with
the Lenders. No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be appointed
hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the
appointment. Any such successor Administrative Agent shall be a Lender or
another commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least
$500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the resigning Administrative Agent. Upon the
effectiveness of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the resigning
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. After the



47
<PAGE>

effectiveness of the resignation of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of
this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative
Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

ARTICLE XI

SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

11.1. SETOFF. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender to
or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied toward
the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the
Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due.

11.2. RATABLE PAYMENTS. Except for payments received from the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.11, if any Lender, whether by setoff
or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments
received pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater proportion than its
ratable share of such Loans, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such
purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender,
whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or
otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such
amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans. In case any
such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.

ARTICLE XII

BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

12.1. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (a) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents and (b) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3. Notwithstanding clause (b) of the immediately preceding
sentence, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement and any promissory note issued to it hereunder to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank shall
release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.



48
<PAGE>

12.2. PARTICIPATIONS.

12.2.1. PERMITTED PARTICIPANTS; EFFECT. Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law,
at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities
("PARTICIPANTS") participating interests in any Loan owing to such
Lender, any promissory note issued hereunder held by such Lender, any
Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under
the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of
participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations
under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the holder of
any such note for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts
payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if
such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents.

12.2.2. VOTING RIGHTS. Each Lender shall retain the sole right
to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other
than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or
Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives
principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees
payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, postpones any date
fixed for any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest
or fees on, any such Loan or Commitment, or extends the Revolving Loan
Termination Date or the Term Loan Termination Date.

12.2.3. BENEFIT OF SETOFF. The Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in
Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing
under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the
Loan Documents; provided that each Lender shall retain the right of
setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of
participating interests sold to each Participant. Each Participant, by
exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to
share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of
its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with
Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.

12.3. ASSIGNMENTS.

12.3.1. PERMITTED ASSIGNMENTS. Any Lender may, in the ordinary
course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all
or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents;
provided, however, that in the case of a partial assignment to an
entity which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, such
assignment shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 (or such lesser
amount as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may approve with
respect to any specific proposed assignment). Such assignment shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit "F" hereto or any other form as
may be



49

agreed to by the parties thereto and approved by the Agent (in each
case, an "Assignment and Acceptance"). The consent of the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required prior to an assignment becoming
effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an
Affiliate thereof; provided, however, that the consent of the Borrower
shall not be required if, on the date of such assignment, a Default
shall have occurred and be continuing. The parties to each assignment
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a processing and recordation
fee of $3,500 and, if the assignee is not a Lender, an Administrative
Questionnaire.

12.3.2. REGISTER. The Administrative Agent, acting for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its
offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount
of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to
the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall
be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

12.3.3. EFFECT; EFFECTIVE DATE. Upon its receipt of a duly
completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and
an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire
(unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the
processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 12.3.1 and any
written consent to such assignment required by Section 12.3.1, the
Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and
record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment
shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. On and after
the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all
purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan
Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all the rights and
obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as
if it were an original party hereto, and the transferor Lender shall be
released with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and
Loans assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action
by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent.

12.4. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. The Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; provided
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section
9.12 of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

12.5. TAX TREATMENT. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 2.17.

ARTICLE XIII

respect to borrowing notices, all notices and other communications provided to

GUARANTY


THIS GUARANTY (this "Guaranty"), dated as of September 30, 2002, is
made by CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), in
favor of LASALLE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as administrative agent, and the
Lenders referred to below.

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of
September 30, 2002 (together with all amendments and other modifications, if
any, from time to time thereafter made thereto, the "Credit Agreement"; terms
defined in the Credit Agreement and used in this Guaranty, including its
preamble and recitals, shall have the meanings provided in the Credit Agreement
unless such terms are otherwise defined herein or the context otherwise
requires), among CNA Surety Corporation ("Borrower"), the Lenders names therein
and LaSalle Bank National Association as administrative agent (in its capacity
as administrative agent, together with any successor in such capacity, the
"Administrative Agent"), the Lenders have agreed to make Revolving Credit Loans
and Term Loans (collectively, the "Loans") to or for the account of the
Borrower; and

WHEREAS, the Guarantor will benefit from the making of the Loans
pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to guaranty the Liabilities (as
defined below) as hereinafter set forth; and

WHEREAS, the Guarantor has duly authorized the execution, delivery and
performance of this Guaranty;

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Guarantor hereby,
unconditionally and (except as otherwise provided herein) irrevocably, as
primary obligor and not merely as surety, guarantees the full and prompt payment
when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of
all obligations of the Borrower to each of the Administrative Agent and each
Lender (as defined below) under or in connection with the Credit Agreement or
any other Loan Document and any other document or instrument executed in
connection therewith, in each case howsoever created, arising or evidenced,
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing,
or due or to become due (all such obligations being herein collectively called
the "Liabilities"); provided that the liability of the Guarantor hereunder shall
be limited to a maximum amount not to exceed $15,000,000 plus (i) interest on
such amount as provided in the Credit Agreement and (ii) all reasonable costs
and expenses paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
enforcing this Guaranty against the Guarantor.

The Guarantor agrees that if any Default shall occur under Section 7.6
of the Credit Agreement, and if such event shall occur at a time when any of the
Liabilities may not then be




C-1
<PAGE>

due and payable, the Guarantor will pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender forthwith the full amount which would be payable
hereunder by the Guarantor if all Liabilities were then due and payable.

This Guaranty shall in all respects (except as otherwise provided
herein) be a continuing, irrevocable, absolute and unconditional guaranty, and
shall remain in full force and effect (notwithstanding, without limitation, the
dissolution of the Guarantor or that at any time or from time to time no
Liabilities are outstanding) until all Commitments have terminated and all
Liabilities have been paid in full.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if, on or
before November 30, 2002, the Administrative Agent either (i) successfully
syndicates not less than $15,000,000 of the Aggregate Commitments or (ii)
elects, in its sole discretion, to retain 100% of the Aggregate Commitment of
$65,000,000, this Guaranty shall be terminated and the Guarantor shall be
released from all of its obligations hereunder; provided, however, that if the
foregoing items (i) or (ii) do not occur on or before November 30, 2002, the
Guarantor shall cause the Borrower, in accordance with the Credit Agreement, to
permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment by $15,000,000 on December 2, 2002,
and to immediately repay on such date its then outstanding Loans in an amount
necessary to effect such reduction, at which time this Guaranty shall be
terminated and the Guarantor shall be released from all of its obligations
hereunder.

The Guarantor further agrees that if at any time all or any part of any
payment theretofore applied by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any of
the Liabilities is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent
or any such Lender for any reason whatsoever (including the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or the Guarantor), such Liabilities
shall, for the purposes of this Guaranty, to the extent that such payment is or
must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence,
notwithstanding such application by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and
this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, as to such Liabilities, all as though such application by the Administrative
Agent or any such Lender had not been made.

The Administrative Agent or any Lender may, from time to time, at its
sole discretion and without notice to the Guarantor, take any or all of the
following actions: (a) retain or obtain the primary or secondary obligation of
any obligor or obligors, in addition to the Guarantor, with respect to any of
the Liabilities, (b) extend or renew any of the Liabilities for one or more
periods (whether or not longer than the original period), alter or exchange any
of the Liabilities, or release or compromise any obligation of the Guarantor
hereunder or any obligation of any nature of any other obligor with respect to
any of the Liabilities, (c) extend or renew for one or more periods (whether or
not longer than the original period) or release, compromise, alter or exchange
any obligations of any nature of any obligor with respect to any Property, and
(d) resort to the Guarantor for payment of any of the Liabilities when due,
whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have resorted to any
property securing any of the Liabilities or any obligation hereunder or shall
have proceeded against the Guarantor or any other obligor primarily or
secondarily obligated with respect to any of the Liabilities, except that there
shall be no recovery by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, individually or
collectively, in excess of the Liabilities (plus (i) interest on such amount as
provided in the



C-2
<PAGE>

Credit Agreement and (ii) all reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender in enforcing this Guaranty against the
Guarantor).

The Guarantor hereby expressly waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law: (a) notice of the acceptance by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender of this Guaranty, (b) notice of the existence or creation or
non-payment of all or any of the Liabilities, (c) presentment, demand, notice of
dishonor, protest, and all other notices whatsoever, and (d) all diligence in
collection or protection of or realization upon any Liabilities or any security
for or guaranty of any Liabilities.

All notices or other communications hereunder shall be given in the
manner and to the addresses set forth in the Credit Agreement.

Notwithstanding any payment made by or for the account of the Guarantor
pursuant to this Guaranty, the Guarantor shall not be subrogated to any right of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender until such time as the Administrative
Agent and Lenders shall have received final payment in cash of the full amount
of all Liabilities.

The Guarantor further agrees to pay all expenses (including reasonable
attorney fees and expenses) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in endeavoring to collect the Liabilities of such Guarantor, or any part
thereof, and in enforcing this Guaranty against the Guarantor.

The creation or existence from time to time of additional Liabilities
to the Administrative Agent or Lenders or any of them is hereby authorized,
without notice to the Guarantor and shall in no way affect or impair the rights
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or the obligations of the Guarantor
under this Guaranty.

The Administrative Agent and any Lender may from time to time without
notice to the Guarantor, assign or transfer any or all of the Liabilities or any
interest therein; and, notwithstanding any such assignment or transfer or any
subsequent assignment or transfer thereof, such Liabilities shall be and remain
Liabilities for the purposes of this Guaranty, and each and every immediate and
successive assignee or transferee of any of the Liabilities or of any interest
therein shall, to the extent of the interest of such assignee or transferee in
the Liabilities, be entitled to the benefits of this Guaranty to the same extent
as if such assignee or transferee were an original Lender.

No delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in the
exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single
or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or
remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or remedy; nor shall any modification or waiver of any provision of
this Guaranty be binding upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender, except as
expressly set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered on behalf of the
Administrative Agent. No action of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender or the obligations of the Guarantor under
this Guaranty. For purposes of this Guaranty,



C-3
<PAGE>

"Liabilities" shall include all obligations of the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender arising under or in connection with the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other document or instrument
executed in connection therewith in each case notwithstanding any right or power
of the Borrower or anyone else to assert any claim or defense as to the
invalidity or unenforceability of any such obligation, and no such claim or
defense shall affect or impair the obligations of any of the Guarantor
hereunder.

Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, (a) this Guaranty has been delivered
to the Administrative Agent and (b) the Administrative Agent has been authorized
to enforce this Guaranty on behalf of itself and each of the Lenders. All
payments by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty shall be made to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders.

This Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor and its successors
and assigns, and to the extent that the Borrower or the Guarantor is either a
partnership or a corporation, all references herein to the Borrower and to the
Guarantor, respectively, shall be deemed to include any successor or successors,
whether immediate or remote, to such partnership or corporation.

This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Illinois applicable to contracts made and to be fully
performed in such State. Wherever possible, each provision of this Guaranty
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be prohibited by or
invalid under such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Guaranty.

This Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the
different parties hereto on separate counterparts, and each such counterpart
shall be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together
constitute one and the same Guaranty. At any time after the date of this
Guaranty, one or more additional Persons may become parties hereto by executing
and delivering to the Administrative Agent a counterpart of this Guaranty.
Immediately upon such execution and delivery (and without any further action),
each such additional Person will become a party to, and will be bound by all of
the terms of, this Guaranty.

ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, SHALL BE BROUGHT AND MAINTAINED
IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS; PROVIDED THAT ANY SUIT SEEKING
ENFORCEMENT AGAINST ANY COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE BROUGHT, AT THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S OPTION, IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH
COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE FOUND. THE GUARANTOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS
FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION AS SET FORTH ABOVE. THE GUARANTOR FURTHER
IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE

SERVICE OF PROCESS BY REGISTERED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO THE ADDRESS SET FORTH
OPPOSITE ITS SIGNATURE HERETO (OR SUCH OTHER ADDRESS AS IT SHALL HAVE SPECIFIED
IN WRITING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AS ITS ADDRESS FOR NOTICES HEREUNDER) OR
BY PERSONAL SERVICE WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. EACH OF THE
GUARANTOR HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING
OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO ABOVE AND
ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

THE GUARANTOR, AND (BY ACCEPTING THE BENEFITS HEREOF) EACH OF THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER, HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS GUARANTY,
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT
DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THEREWITH OR ARISING FROM ANY FINANCING RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH
ANY OF THE FOREGOING, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE

[FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE BORROWER AND THE GUARANTOR]

September 30, 2002



LaSalle Bank National Association,
as Administrative Agent

and

Each of the Lenders
identified on Schedule I hereto

Ladies/Gentlemen:

I am counsel for Continental Casualty Company, and in such capacity, am
representing (i) CNA Surety Corporation (the "Borrower") in connection with its
execution and delivery of a Credit Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2002
(the "Agreement") among the Borrower, the Lenders named therein and LaSalle Bank
National Association, as Administrative Agent for the Lenders, providing for
Advances in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $65,000,000 at any one
time outstanding, and (ii) the Guaranty, dated as of September 30, 2002 from CNA
Financial Corporation (the "Guarantor") in favor of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders. All capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement. This
opinion is being delivered to the addressees at the request of the Borrower
pursuant to Section 4.1(f) of the Agreement.

I have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified
to my satisfaction, of such corporate records, agreements, instruments and
documents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and certificates and other
statements of public officials and corporate officers, and have made such other
investigation of fact and law, as I have deemed necessary in connection with the
opinions set forth herein. In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of
all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to originals of
all documents submitted to me as copies.

Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the comments and exceptions
hereinafter set forth, I am of the opinion that:

1. The Borrower and each Significant Subsidiary are corporations duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their
respective states of incorporation. The Borrower has all requisite power and
authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is
conducted.

<PAGE>

2. The Guarantor is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation. The Guarantor
has all requisite power and authority to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.

3. The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the Borrower and
the Guaranty by the Guarantor and the performance by the Borrower of the
Obligations and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under the
Guaranty have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and
proceedings on the part of the Borrower and the Guarantor, as applicable, and
will not:

(a) require any consent of the Borrower's shareholders or the
Guarantor's shareholders, as applicable;

(b) violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (or the Guarantor's) or the Borrower's (or the
Guarantor's) articles of incorporation or by-laws or any material
indenture, instrument or agreement known to me and binding upon the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (or the Guarantor); or

(c) result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any
Lien pursuant to the provisions of any material indenture, instrument
or agreement binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (or
the Guarantor).

4. The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the
Borrower and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower
enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms except to the
extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
subject also to the availability of equitable remedies if equitable remedies are
sought.

5. The Guaranty has been duly executed by the Guarantor and constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against
the Guarantor in accordance with its respective terms.

6. To my knowledge after due inquiry, there is no action, suit,
proceeding, governmental investigation or arbitration pending or threatened
against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator
or any governmental or administrative body, agency or official which (a)
challenges the validity, or seeks to enjoin the performance of, the Loan
Documents or the consummation of any of the Closing Transactions or (b) could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

7. No approval, authorization, consent, adjudication or order of any
Governmental Authority, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents, the borrowings under the Agreement or in connection with the payment
by the Borrower of the Obligations.

This opinion is limited to the law of the State of Illinois the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United
States of America.

This opinion may be relied on by any party that becomes a Participant,
Lender or Administrative Agent under the Agreement after the date hereof
pursuant to the Agreement.

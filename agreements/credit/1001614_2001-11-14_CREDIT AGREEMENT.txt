THE LOAN

2.01   THE  REVOLVING   LOAN.   Upon  the  terms  and   conditions
(including, without limitation, the right of the Bank to terminate the Revolving
Commitment  hereunder  upon an Event of Default or to suspend its  obligation to
make advances under the Revolving Commitment upon an Unmatured Event of Default)
and relying on the representations  and warranties  contained in this Agreement,
the Bank  agrees,  for a period  from and  after  the date  hereof  through  the
Revolving Loan  Termination  Date, to make advances to the Borrower from time to
time following  receipt of a Request for Advance at least one Business Day prior
to such  requested  advance,  in  such  amounts  as the  Borrower  may  request;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, each such advance shall be in an amount of not less

11
<PAGE>


than  $100,000.00  and in an integral  multiple of $10,000.00  and the aggregate
principal  amount of all advances  made pursuant to this Section 2.01 and at any
one time outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving Commitment.

Through the Revolving Loan Termination  Date, the Borrower may use
this revolving credit by borrowing, prepaying and reborrowing, all in accordance
with the terms and  conditions of this  Agreement.  The  borrowings  made by the
Borrower  pursuant to the  Revolving  Commitment  shall be solely  requested  by
Tengasco,  Inc.  through a Request for Advance and all  advances to the Borrower
may be made by the Bank to Tengasco,  Inc's account at the  principal  office of
the Bank in Houston,  Texas. All Loans shall be evidenced by the Revolving Note.
The entire  principal  amount of the Revolving Note is due on the Revolving Loan
Termination Date.

2.02   ADVANCES  AND  PAYMENTS OF  PRINCIPAL  UNDER THE  REVOLVING
NOTE.  Each time an advance is made against or payment is made on the  Revolving
Note,  the  Bank  is  hereby  irrevocably  authorized  by the  Borrower  to make
appropriate  entries  of such in its  records in  accordance  with the usual and
customary practices of accounting for advances and payments on notes;  provided,
however,  the failure of the Bank to do so shall not relieve the Borrower of its
correct liability hereunder or under the Revolving Note.

The aggregate unpaid amount of advances reflected by the notations
by the Bank on its records or the ledger sheets  affixed to the  Revolving  Note
shall be deemed rebuttably presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing on
the  Revolving  Note.  The  liability  for  payment of  principal  and  interest
evidenced by the Revolving Note shall be limited to principal  amounts  actually
advanced to the Borrower and  outstanding  under this  Agreement and interest on
such amounts calculated in accordance with this Agreement. Interest provided for
in the  Revolving  Note and herein shall be  calculated  on unpaid sums actually
advanced and outstanding  under the Revolving Note pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and only for the period from the date or dates of such advances  until
repayment.

2.03 PAYMENTS OF INTEREST UNDER THE REVOLVING NOTE. Subject to
the terms and  provisions of this  Agreement,  interest on the  Revolving  Loan,
calculated at the Floating Rate,  shall be due and payable monthly as it accrues
beginning  December 1, 2001, and continuing  thereafter on the first day of each
succeeding  calendar  month while any amount remains owing on the Revolving Note
and at the  Revolving  Loan  Termination  Date,  the  interest  payment  in each
instance  to be that  which has been  earned  and  remains  unpaid.  The rate of
interest  charged on the  Revolving  Loan shall be  adjusted,  effective  on the
effective date of each change in the Prime Rate,  and in the ordinary  course of
business the Bank shall send written notice to the Borrower that a change in the
Prime Rate has occurred.

2.04   GENERAL   PROVISIONS   RELATING  TO  INTEREST.   All  Loans
hereunder  and  outstanding  from time to time shall bear  interest  at the rate
prescribed in the Revolving  Note, as  applicable,  calculated on the basis of a
year of three  hundred  sixty  (360) days from the date of  advance  to, but not
including, the date of repayment.

It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply  strictly with
the usury Laws of the State of Texas and the United  States of America  and,  in
this connection, there shall never be collected, charged or received on any sums
advanced  hereunder  interest in excess of the  Maximum  Rate.  For  purposes of
Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended,  the Borrower agrees that the
maximum rate to be charged  shall be the  "indicated  (weekly)  rate ceiling" as
defined  in said  Chapter,  provided  that the Bank may also rely to the  extent
permitted  by  applicable  Laws of the  State of Texas or the  United  States of
America, on alternative maximum rates of interest under other applicable Laws of
the State of Texas or the United  States of America  applicable  to the Bank, if
greater.  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Note to the contrary, during
any Limitation  Period,  the interest rate to be charged on amounts evidenced by
the Note shall be the Maximum  Rate and the  obligation  of the Borrower for any
fees payable  hereunder and deemed to be interest under  applicable Law shall be
suspended.  During any period or periods of time following a Limitation  Period,
to the extent  permitted by applicable  Laws of the State of Texas or the United
States of America, the interest rate to be charged hereunder shall remain at the
Maximum  Rate  until such time as there has been paid to the Bank (a) the amount
of  interest  in excess of the  Maximum  Rate that the Bank would have  received
during the  Limitation  Period had the  interest  rate  remained at the relevant
rates  specified in the Note, and (b) all interest and fees otherwise due to the
Bank but for the effect of such Limitation Period.

If under any  circumstances the aggregate amounts paid on the Note
or under this  Agreement  include  amounts which by Law are deemed  interest and
which would exceed the amount permitted if the Maximum Rate were in effect,  the
Borrower  stipulates that such payment and collection will have been and will be
deemed to have been, to the extent  permitted by applicable Laws of the State of
Texas or the United States of America,  the result of mathematical  error on the
part of both the Borrower and the Bank, and the Bank shall  promptly  refund the
amount of such excess (to the extent only of such  interest  payments  above the
Maximum  Rate which  could  lawfully  have been  collected  and  retained)  upon
discovery of such error by the Bank or notice thereof from the Borrower.

2.05   BORROWING BASE DETERMINATION. The initial Borrowing Base is
hereby  established at  $10,000,000.00.  Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, the initial Monthly Borrowing Base Reduction is hereby established at
$0.00. If the next Borrowing Base  redetermination has not occurred on or before
February 1, 2002,  the Monthly  Borrowing  Base Reduction will be established as
$200,000.00  commencing  February 1, 2002.  On or before  December 1, 2002,  the
Borrower  shall  furnish  to the Bank  information  sufficient  to  update to an
effective  date of  November  1, 2001,  the most  recent  petroleum  engineering
reports  provided to the Bank prior to Closing  relative to the Proved  Reserves
attributable to the Borrowing Base Oil and Gas Properties.  Upon receipt of such
report,  the Bank shall, in the normal course of business,  make a determination
of the  Borrowing  Base and the Monthly  Borrowing  Base  Reduction  which shall
become effective upon written  notification  from the Bank to the Borrower,  and
which, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,  shall be the basis on
which the Borrowing Base shall thereafter be calculated until the effective date
of the next redetermination of the Borrowing Base and the Monthly Borrowing Base
Reduction as set forth in this Section. Thereafter, on or before each June

13
<PAGE>


1 and December 1 until the Revolving Loan  Termination  Date, the Borrower shall
furnish to the Bank a report,  in form and substance  satisfactory  to the Bank,
which  report  shall set forth,  as of each  preceding  May 1 or  November 1, as
applicable,  the Proved Reserves  attributable to the Borrowing Base Oil and Gas
Properties.  Each  report to be  provided  on or  before  each June 1 shall be a
complete report  relating to the Proved  Reserves  attributable to the Borrowing
Base Oil and Gas  Properties  prepared by an independent  petroleum  engineer or
firm of  engineers  reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Bank.  Each  report  to be
provided on or before each December 1 shall simply update the previous  complete
report,  and may be  prepared  by the  Borrower's  own  engineers  and  shall be
certified by the President,  Chief Executive  Officer or Chief Financial Officer
of the Borrower. Upon receipt of each such report, the Bank shall, in the normal
course of business,  make a determination  of the Borrowing Base and the Monthly
Borrowing Base Reduction which shall become effective upon written  notification
from the Bank to the  Borrower,  and which,  subject to the other  provisions of
this Agreement,  shall be the basis on which the Borrowing Base shall thereafter
be  calculated  until  the  effective  date of the next  redetermination  of the
Borrowing  Base and the Monthly  Borrowing  Base  Reduction as set forth in this
Section  2.05.  The Bank may  redetermine  the  Borrowing  Base and the  Monthly
Borrowing  Base  Reduction,   at  any  time,  and  from  time  to  time,   which
redetermination  shall become effective upon written  notification from the Bank
to the Borrower and which,  subject to the other  provisions of this  Agreement,
shall be the basis on which the  Borrowing  Base shall  thereafter be calculated
until the effective date of the next  redetermination  of the Borrowing Base and
the Monthly Borrowing Base Reduction, as set forth in this Section. The Bank may
require the Borrower to provide a report  prepared by an  independent  petroleum
engineer or firm of engineers reasonably  satisfactory to the Bank regarding the
Proved Reserves attributable to the Borrowing Base Oil and Gas Properties at any
time upon ninety (90) days advance notice to the Borrower.

The Borrowing Base shall  represent the Bank's  determination,  in
accordance with its customary lending practices, of the maximum loan amount with
respect  to  the  Borrowing  Base  Oil  and  Gas  Properties  and  the  Borrower
acknowledges,  for purposes of this Agreement, such determination by the Bank as
being the maximum  loan amount with  respect to the  Borrowing  Base Oil and Gas
Properties.  In making any redetermination of the Borrowing Base, the Bank shall
apply the  parameters  then  generally  being utilized by the Bank for Borrowing
Base  redeterminations for other similarly situated borrowers.  The Borrower and
the  Bank  acknowledge  that  (a)  due to the  uncertainties  of the oil and gas
extraction process, the Borrowing Base Oil and Gas Properties are not subject to
evaluation  with a high degree of accuracy  and are subject to  potential  rapid
deterioration  in  value,  and (b) for  this  reason  and the  difficulties  and
expenses  involved in liquidating and collecting  against the Borrowing Base Oil
and Gas  Properties,  the Bank's  determination  of the maximum loan amount with
respect to the Borrowing Base Oil and Gas Properties contains an equity cushion,
which  equity  cushion is  acknowledged  by the  Borrower as  essential  for the
adequate protection of the Bank.

2.06   MANDATORY  PREPAYMENT  OF THE NOTE.  In the event  that the
Bank determines that a Loan Excess exists, the Borrower shall  immediately,  but
in no event later than thirty  (30) days  following  notice from the Bank of any
such scheduled or non-scheduled Borrowing Base

14
<PAGE>


determination,  (i) prepay the principal of the  Revolving  Note in an aggregate
amount at least equal to such Loan Excess or (ii) add to the Borrowing  Base Oil
and Gas Properties  additional Oil and Gas Properties of the Borrower sufficient
in value, as determined by the Bank in its sole  discretion  pursuant to Section
2.05, to increase the Borrowing Base to equal the unpaid principal amount of the
Revolving Note.  Notwithstanding the foregoing  provisions of this section,  the
Borrower  shall pay the amount of any Loan  Excess  that would  result  from the
application  of each Monthly  Borrowing Base Reduction on or before the day that
such Monthly Borrowing Base Reduction becomes applicable.

2.07   ADVANCES TO SATISFY  OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER.  The Bank
may, but shall not be obligated  to, make  advances  hereunder and apply same to
the satisfaction of any condition,  warranty,  representation or covenant of the
Borrower  contained  in this  Agreement,  and the funds so advanced  and applied
shall be part of the Loan proceeds  advanced  under this Agreement and evidenced
by the Revolving Note.

2.08   ASSIGNMENT   OF   PRODUCTION.   Certain  of  the   Security
Instruments  covering  the  Borrowing  Base Oil and Gas  Properties  contain  an
assignment  unto and in favor of the  Bank of all oil,  gas and  other  minerals
produced and to be produced from or  attributable  to the Borrowing Base Oil and
Gas Properties  together with all of the revenues and proceeds  attributable  to
such  production,  and such Security  Instruments  further provide that all such
revenues  and proceeds  which may be so  collected  by the Bank  pursuant to the
assignment  shall be applied to the payment of the Note and the  satisfaction of
all other Indebtedness to be secured by such Security Instruments.  The Borrower
hereby appoints the Bank its agent and attorney-in-fact until this Agreement has
been  terminated  in  accordance  with  Section  8.18  hereof  for  purposes  of
completing the letter transfer orders  delivered to the Bank pursuant to Section
3.01 hereof which power is coupled with an interest and is not revocable.

2.09   COMMITMENT FEE. As consideration  for the commitment of the
Bank to make Loans to the Borrower  through the Revolving Loan  Termination Date
pursuant to this  Agreement,  the Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank within five
(5) Business  Days of receipt of the Bank's  statement  as to quarterly  periods
ending March 31, June 30,  September 30 and December 31 of each year (except the
first  period  shall be for a period of time from the  Closing to  December  31,
2001)  during  the  period  commencing  on the  date  of this  Agreement  to and
including  the  Revolving  Loan  Termination  Date  and  at the  Revolving  Loan
Termination  Date,  a fee equal  one-half of one  percent  (1/2 of 1%) per annum
(computed  on the  basis of 360)  multiplied  by an  amount  equal to the  daily
average excess, if any, of the Revolving Commitment over the aggregate principal
amount  outstanding  on the Note,  throughout  the period  from the date of this
Agreement or previous  calculation  date provided above,  whichever is later, to
the relevant  calculation  date or the Revolving Loan  Termination  Date, as the
case may be.

2.10   FACILITY FEE. As  consideration  for the  commitment of the
Bank to make Loans to the  Borrower  pursuant to this  Agreement,  the  Borrower
shall pay to the Bank a facility  fee of one and one fourth  percent (1 1/4%) of
the amount of the initial Borrowing Base established in

15
<PAGE>


Section  2.05  hereof.  Any time the  Borrowing  Base is  increased  pursuant to
Section 2.05,  an  additional  facility fee shall be paid to Bank by Borrower in
the amount of  three-fourths  of one  percent  (3/4 of 1%) of any such  increase
above the  highest  Borrowing  Base that was in effect at any time prior to such
increase.

2.11   ADMINISTRATIVE FEE. As further consideration for the Bank's
obligations  pursuant  to  this  Agreement,   Borrower  shall  pay  to  Bank  an
administrative fee of $15,000.00 on each anniversary of the date of Closing, and
on the Revolving Loan Termination Date.

2.12   ADDITION/DELETION  OF BORROWING BASE OIL & GAS  PROPERTIES.
The Borrower may, from time to time upon fifteen (15) days prior written  notice
to the  Bank,  propose  to add Oil and Gas  Properties  of the  Borrower  to the
Borrowing  Base Oil and Gas  Properties.  Any such  proposal  to add Oil and Gas
Properties of the Borrower to the Borrowing Base Oil and Gas Properties shall be
accompanied by an engineering report applicable to such properties that conforms
to the  requirements  of Section 2.05 and evidence  sufficient to establish that
the Borrower has Marketable  Title to such Oil and Gas Properties,  and any such
addition  shall  become  effective  at such  time as:  (a) the Bank has made its
determination  of the amount by which the  Borrowing  Base would be increased as
the result of such  addition  and (b) the  conditions  set forth in Article  III
hereof,  to the  extent  they  are  applicable  to such  additional  Oil and Gas
Properties of the Borrower, have been satisfied.

2.13   ADJUSTMENT  TO  REVOLVING  COMMITMENT  LIMIT.  Borrower may
propose not more than twice  during any rolling  twelve  (12) month  period,  in
addition to the Borrowing Base redetermination allowed pursuant to Section 2.05,
to increase the Borrowing  Base by adding  additional  Oil and Gas Properties to
the Borrowing Base Oil and Gas Properties pursuant to Section 2.12, Borrower may
also request that Bank increase the amount of the Revolving Commitment Limit. At
any time that Borrower makes such a request it shall promptly  provide Bank with
such financial  information as Bank may request to assist the Bank in evaluating
such request.  Following the receipt of such information from Borrower, the Bank
shall,  in the normal  course of its  business,  make a  redetermination  of the
Revolving   Commitment   Limit,   which  shall  become  effective  upon  written
notification  from the Bank to Borrower of the new Revolving  Commitment  Limit.
The Borrower may, on a quarterly  basis,  upon written notice to the Bank, amend
the  definition  of the  Revolving  Commitment  Limit by reducing the amount set
forth in such definition.  Upon such reduction,  the Bank shall not be obligated
to extend Loans in excess of such reduced  Revolving  Commitment  Limit.  If and
when the Bank increases the Revolving  Commitment  Limit at Borrower's  request,
the commitment  fee, as determined  pursuant to Section 2.09 of this  Agreement,
shall be  calculated  using such  increased  amount  for all of the  calculation
period in which such Revolving Commitment Limit was increased.

Default  shall have been waived by the Bank or the relevant  Unmatured  Event of
Default shall have been remedied prior to ripening into an Event of Default.

Default specified in Subsections 7.01 (f) or (g), the entire aggregate principal
amount of all Indebtedness  then outstanding  hereunder and the interest accrued

7.04   REMEDIES.  After  any  acceleration,  as  provided  for  in
Section 7.03,  the Bank shall have, in addition to the rights and remedies given
them by this  Agreement and the Security  Instruments,  all those allowed by all
applicable Laws, including, but without limitation,  the Uniform Commercial Code
as  enacted  in any  jurisdiction  in  which  any  Borrowing  Base  Oil  and Gas
Properties may be located. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Bank may  immediately,  without demand of  performance  and without other notice
(except as specifically  required by this Agreement or the Security Instruments)
or demand whatsoever to the Borrower,  all of which are hereby expressly waived,
and without  advertisement,  sell at public or private sale or otherwise realize
upon, in Harris  County,  Texas,  or in any other place where the Borrowing Base
Oil and Gas Properties  may be located,  or in such other place or places as the
Bank may  designate,  the whole or, from time to time, any part of the Borrowing
Base  Oil and Gas  Properties,  or any  interest  which  the  Borrower  may have
therein.  After deducting from the proceeds of sale or other  disposition of the
Borrowing  Base Oil and Gas  Properties  all expenses  (including all reasonable
expenses  for legal  services),  the Bank shall apply such  proceeds  toward the
satisfaction   of  the   Obligations.   Any  remainder  of  the  proceeds  after
satisfaction  in full of the  Obligations  shall be  distributed  as required by
applicable Laws.  Notice of any sale or other  disposition shall be given to the
Borrower  at least five (5) days  before  the time of any public  sale or of the
time after which any intended private sale or other disposition of the Borrowing
Base Oil and Gas  Properties  is to be made,  which the Borrower  hereby  agrees
shall be  reasonable  notice of such  sale or other  disposition.  The  Borrower
agrees to assemble, or to cause to be assembled,  at its own expense,  documents
evidencing  its ownership of the Borrowing  Base Oil and Gas Properties and such
other  documents  or items as the Bank may  reasonably  request at such place or
places as the Bank shall designate.  At any such sale or other disposition,  the
Bank may, to the extent permissible under applicable Laws, purchase the whole or
any part of the Borrowing  Base Oil and Gas  Properties,  free from any right of
redemption  on the part of the  Borrower,  which  right  is  hereby  waived  and
released.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of any of the rights and remedies
conferred upon the Bank under this  paragraph,  the Bank may, to the full extent
permitted by the applicable Laws:

(A)    Enter upon the premises of the Borrower (and, to the extent
necessary  in the  judgment  of the Bank,  exclude  therefrom  the
Borrower or any Affiliate  thereof) and take immediate  possession
of the Borrowing Base Oil and Gas Properties, either personally or
by  means  of  a  receiver  appointed  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction, using all necessary force to do so;

(B)    At the Bank's option, use, operate, manage, and control the
Borrowing Base Oil and Gas Properties in any lawful manner;

(C)    Collect and receive all rents, income,  revenue,  earnings,
issues, and profits therefrom; and

37
<PAGE>


(D)    Maintain,  repair, renovate, alter, or remove the Borrowing
Base Oil and Gas  Properties  as the Bank may  determine  in their
discretion.

7.05   RIGHT OF  SET-OFF.  Upon  the  occurrence  of any  Event of
Default, the Bank may, and is hereby authorized by the Borrower, at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable  Laws,  without
advance  notice to the Borrower (any such notice being  expressly  waived by the
Borrower),  set-off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,  time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and any other indebtedness at any
time  owing by the Bank to or for the  credit  or the  account  of the  Borrower
against any or all of the Obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing,
whether or not such  Obligations  have matured and  irrespective  of whether the
Bank may have exercised any other rights that they have or may have with respect
to such Obligations, including, without limitation, any acceleration rights. The
Bank  agrees  promptly  to  notify  the  Borrower  after  any such  set-off  and
application,  provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity  of such  set-off  and  application.  The rights of the Bank under this
Section  7.05 are in  addition  to the other  rights  and  remedies  (including,
without limitation, other rights of set-off) which the Bank may have.

This Exhibit sets forth the  description of the Borrowing Base Oil
& Gas Properties covered by the Agreement to which this Exhibit is attached. All
of the terms  defined in the  Agreement  are used in this  Exhibit with the same
meanings given therein.

This Exhibit and the Agreement cover and include the following:

(a)    All of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the oil, gas
and mineral leases described herein and/or lands described in and subject
to such oil, gas and mineral leases (regardless, as to such leases and/or
lands, of any surface  acreage and/or depth  limitations set forth in any
description  of any of such  oil,  gas and  mineral  leases),  and all of
Borrower's  right,  title and  interest in and to any of the oil, gas and
minerals in, on or under the lands,  if any,  described on this  Exhibit,
including,  without  limitation,  all contractual  rights, fee interests,
leasehold  interests,  overriding  royalty  interests,  non-participating
royalty interests,  mineral interests,  production payments,  net profits
interests, or any other interest measured by or payable out of production
of oil, gas or other minerals from the oil, gas and mineral leases and/or
lands described herein; and

(b)    All of the foregoing  interests of the Borrower as such  interests
may be enlarged by the  discharge of any payments out of production or by
the removal of any charges or  encumbrances  together with the Borrower's
interests in, to and under or derived from all renewals and extensions of
any oil, gas and mineral leases described herein,  it being  specifically
intended  hereby  that any new oil and gas lease (i) in which an interest
is acquired by the Borrower  after the  termination  or expiration of any
oil and gas lease,  the  interests  of the  Borrower  in, to and under or
derived from which are subject to the lien and security  interest hereof,
and (ii) that  covers all or any part of the  property  described  in and
covered by such terminated or expired leases,  shall, to the extent,  and
only to the extent such new oil and gas lease may cover such property, be
considered a renewal or extension of such  terminated  or expired  lease;
and

(c)    All right,  title and  interest  of  Borrower  in, to and under or
derived from any operating, farmout, and bidding agreements,  assignments
and subleases,  whether or not described in this Exhibit,  to the extent,
and only to the extent,  that such agreements,  assignments and subleases
(i) cover or  include  any of the  Borrower's  present  right,  title and
interest in and to the leases and/or lands described in this Exhibit,  or
(ii) cover or include any other undivided interests now or hereafter held
by the  Borrower  in, to and under the  described  leases  and/or  lands,
including, without

1
<PAGE>


limitation,  any  future  operating,   farmout  and  bidding  agreements,
assignments,  subleases  and  pooling,  unitization  and  communitization
agreements and the units created thereby  (including,  without limitation
all units formed under orders, regulations,  rules or other official acts
of any governmental body or agency having jurisdiction) to the extent and
only to the extent that such agreements, assignments, subleases, or units
cover or include the described leases and/or lands; and

(d)    All right, title, and interest of the Borrower in, to and under or
derived  from  all  presently   existing  and  future   advance   payment
agreements,  oil, casinghead gas and gas sales,  exchange, and processing
contracts and agreements including,  without limitation,  those contracts
and agreements that are described on this Exhibit to the extent, and only
to the  extent,  those  contracts  and  agreements  cover or include  the
described leases and/or lands herein; and

(e)    All right,  title and interest of the Borrower in, to and under or
derived from all existing and future  permits,  licenses,  easements  and
similar rights and privileges that relate to or are appurtenant to any of
the described leases and/or lands.

Notwithstanding  the  intention of this  Agreement to cover all of
the right,  title and interest of Borrower in and to the described leases and/or
lands,  except  as  expressly  set forth  herein  Borrower  hereby  specifically
warrants  and  represents  that the  interests  covered by this  Exhibit are not
greater  than the  working  interest  nor less  than the net  revenue  interest,
overriding royalty interest, net profit interest, production payment interest or
other interest  payable out of or measured by production set forth in connection
with each oil and gas well described in this Exhibit.  In the event the Borrower
owns any other or  greater  interest,  such  additional  interest  shall also be
covered by and included in this Agreement. The designation "Working Interest" or
"W.I." means an interest owned in an oil, gas, and mineral lease that determines
the cost bearing percentage of the owner of such interest.  The designation "Net
Revenue  Interest" or "NRI" means net revenue  interest,  or that portion of the
production  attributable to the owner of a working  interest after deduction for
all royalty burdens, overriding royalty burdens, or other burdens on production,
except  severance,  production,  windfall  profits and other similar taxes.  The
designation  "Overriding  Royalty  Interest"  or  "ORRI"  means an  interest  in
production  which is free of any  obligation  for the  expense  of  exploration,
development  and  production,  bearing  only  its pro rata  share of  severance,
production, windfall profits and other similar taxes.

REVOLVING NOTE

$35,000,000.00                   Houston, Texas                 November 8, 2000

On the dates hereinafter prescribed, for value received,  TENGASCO, INC.,
a  Tennessee  corporation,  TENNESSEE  LAND & MINERAL  CORPORATION,  a Tennessee
corporation,  and TENGASCO PIPELINE CORPORATION, a Tennessee corporation (herein
called  collectively,  the  "Borrower"),  having an address at 603 Main  Avenue,
Suite 500, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902, promises to pay to the order of BANK ONE,
NA (herein  called  "Bank"),  at its  principal  offices  at 910 Travis  Street,
Houston,  Harris County,  Texas 77002,  (i) the principal  amount of THIRTY-FIVE
MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS  ($35,000,000.00)  or the principal  amount  advanced
pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (defined herein) as of the date of
maturity  hereof,  whether by  acceleration  or otherwise,  whichever may be the
lesser,  and (ii) interest on the  principal  balance from time to time advanced
and remaining  unpaid from the date of the advance  until  maturity at a rate of
interest  equal to lesser of (a) the  "Floating  Rate" (as defined in the Credit
Agreement)  calculated  on the  basis of a year of 360  days and for the  actual
number of days elapsed  (including the first day but excluding the last day), or
(b) the  Maximum  Rate (as  defined in the Credit  Agreement).  Any  increase or
decrease in interest rate  resulting  from a change in the Maximum Rate shall be
effective immediately when such change becomes effective,  without notice to the
Borrower,  unless  Applicable Law (as defined below) requires that such increase
or decrease not be effective until a later time, in which event such increase or
decrease shall be effective at the earliest time permitted  under the provisions
of such law.

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if during any period the Floating  Rate
exceeds the applicable Maximum Rate, the rate of interest in effect on this Note
shall be limited to the Maximum Rate during each such  period,  but at all times
thereafter the rate of interest in effect on this Note shall be the Maximum Rate
until the total amount of interest  accrued on this Note equals the total amount
of interest  which would have  accrued  hereon if the  Floating  Rate had at all
times been in effect.

All payments on this Note shall be applied first to accrued  interest and
the balance, if any, to principal.

"Applicable  Law"  means  that  law in  effect  from  time  to  time  and
applicable to this Note which  lawfully  permits the charging and  collection of
the  highest  permissible  lawful,  non-usurious  rate of interest on this Note,
including  laws of the State of Texas and laws of the United  States of America.
It is intended  that Chapter 303 of the Texas  Finance Code shall be included in
the  laws of the  State  of Texas in  determining  Applicable  Law;  and for the
purpose  of  applying  said  Chapter  303 to this  Note,  the  interest  ceiling
applicable  to this Note under said  Chapter 303 shall be the  indicated  weekly
rate ceiling from time to time in effect. The Borrower and the Bank hereby agree

Borrower's Initials

<PAGE>


that Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code,  shall not apply to this Note or the
loan  transaction   evidenced  by,  and  referenced  in,  the  Credit  Agreement
(hereinafter  defined)  in any  manner,  including  without  limitation,  to any
account or arrangement evidenced or created by, or provided for in, this Note.

This  Note is a  revolving  credit  note and it is  contemplated  that by
reason of prepayments  hereon there may be times when no  indebtedness  is owing
hereunder; but notwithstanding such occurrence, this Note shall remain valid and
in full force and effect as to each principal advance made hereunder  subsequent
to each such  occurrence.  Each  principal  advance and each payment hereof made
pursuant to this Note shall be reflected by the Bank's records and the aggregate
unpaid amounts reflected by such records shall constitute rebuttably presumptive
evidence of the principal and unpaid,  accrued interest remaining outstanding on
this Note.

The  principal  sum of this Note,  after  giving  credit  for  unadvanced
principal,  if any, remaining at final maturity,  shall be due and payable on or
before November 8, 2004;  interest to accrue upon the principal sum from time to
time  owing  and  unpaid   hereunder   shall  be  due  and  payable  in  monthly
installments, as it accrues, with the first such monthly installment of interest
hereon being due and payable on the first day of November,  2001,  and with such
subsequent  installments  of interest  being due and payable on the first day of
each succeeding month thereafter;  provided,  however,  the final installment of
interest  hereunder  shall be due and payable not later than the maturity of the
principal sum hereof, howsoever such maturity may be brought about.

When the first  (1st) day of a  calendar  month  falls  upon a  Saturday,
Sunday or legal holiday, the payment of interest and principal, if any, due upon
such date shall be due and payable upon the next succeeding Business Day.

In no event shall the  aggregate of the  interest on this Note,  plus any
other  amounts  paid in  connection  with the loan  evidenced by this Note which
would under Applicable Law be deemed  "interest," ever exceed the maximum amount
of interest which, under Applicable Law, could be lawfully charged on this Note.
The Bank and the Borrower  specifically  intend and agree to limit contractually
the interest  payable on this Note to not more than an amount  determined at the
Maximum Rate. Therefore, none of the terms of this Note or any other instruments
pertaining to or securing this Note shall ever be construed to create a contract
to pay  interest  at a rate in excess  of the  Maximum  Rate,  and  neither  the
Borrower nor any other party liable herefor shall ever be liable for interest in
excess of that  determined  at the  Maximum  Rate,  and the  provisions  of this
paragraph  shall  control  over  all  provisions  of this  Note or of any  other
instruments pertaining to or securing this Note. If any amount of interest taken
or  received  by the Bank shall be in excess of the  maximum  amount of interest
which,  under  Applicable  Law, could lawfully have been collected on this Note,
then the excess shall be deemed to have been the result of a mathematical  error
by the  parties  hereto and shall be  refunded  promptly  to the  Borrower.  All
amounts paid or agreed to be paid in connection with the indebtedness  evidenced
by this Note which would under Applicable Law be deemed

Borrower's Initials

"Interest"  shall,  to the extent  permitted by  Applicable  Law, be  amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of this Note.

This Note is secured by all security agreements,  collateral assignments,
mortgages and lien instruments  executed by the Borrower (or by any other party)
in  favor of Bank,  including  those  executed  simultaneously  herewith,  those
executed heretofore and those hereafter executed, and including specifically and
without  limitation  the  Security  Instruments  described  and  defined in that
certain  Credit  Agreement of even date herewith  between  Borrower and the Bank
(the "Credit Agreement").

This Note is the Revolving Note issued pursuant to the Credit  Agreement.
Reference is hereby made to the Credit  Agreement  for a statement of the rights
and obligations of the holder of this Note and the duties and obligations of the
Borrower in relation thereto; but neither this reference to the Credit Agreement
nor any provisions thereof shall affect or impair the absolute and unconditional
obligation of the Borrower to pay any  outstanding  and unpaid  principal of and
interest  on this Note  when due,  in  accordance  with the terms of the  Credit
Agreement.  Each advance and each  payment  made  pursuant to this Note shall be
reflected by notations made by the Bank on its records and the aggregate  unpaid
amounts  reflected  by the  notations on the records of the Bank shall be deemed
rebuttably presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing under this Note.

In the event of default in the payment  when due of any of the  principal
of or any interest on this Note,  or in the event of default  under the terms of
the Credit Agreement or any of the Security Instruments,  or if any event occurs
or condition  exists which  authorizes the  acceleration of the maturity of this
Note under any agreement made by the Borrower, the Bank (or other holder of this
Note) may, at its  option,  without  presentment  or demand or any notice to the
Borrower  or any other  person  liable  herefor,  declare  the unpaid  principal
balance of and accrued interest on this Note to be immediately due and payable.

If this Note is  collected  by suit or through the Probate or  Bankruptcy
Court,  or any  judicial  proceeding,  or if this Note is not paid at  maturity,
however  such  maturity may be brought  about,  and is placed in the hands of an
attorney  for  collection,  then  the  Borrower  agrees  to pay  reasonable  and
documented  attorneys'  fees, not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the full amount
of principal  and  interest  owing hereon at the time this Note is placed in the
hands of an attorney.

The Borrower  agrees that the  obligations of each are joint and several.
The Borrower  and all  sureties,  endorsers  and  guarantors  of this Note waive
demand,  presentment  for  payment,  notice of  nonpayment,  protest,  notice of
protest,  notice of intent to accelerate  maturity,  notice of  acceleration  of
maturity, and all other notices, filing of suit and diligence in collecting this
Note or enforcing any of the security  herefor,  and agree to any  substitution,
exchange or release of any such  security or the release of any party  primarily
or  secondarily  liable hereon and further  agrees that it will not be necessary
for the  Bank,  in order  to  enforce  payment  of this  Note by them,  to first
institute

to enforce its rights  against any security  herefor,  and consent to any one or
more extensions or postponements of time of payment of this Note on any terms or
any other  indulgences  with respect  hereto,  without  notice thereof to any of
them. The Bank may transfer this Note, and the rights and privileges of the Bank
under  this Note  shall  inure to the  benefit  of the  Bank's  representatives,
successors or assigns.

Schedule 4.14   Litigation

Except  as  described  hereafter,  the  Company  is not a party to any
pending material legal proceeding.  To the knowledge of management,  no federal,
state or local  governmental  agency is presently  contemplating  any proceeding
against the Company which would have a result materially adverse to the Company.
To the knowledge of management,  no director,  executive officer or affiliate of
the Company or owner of record or  beneficially of more than 5% of the Company's
common  stock is a party  adverse  to the  Company  or has a  material  interest
adverse to the Company in any proceeding.

1.   The  Company  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Tengasco  Pipeline
Corporation ("TPC"),  were named as defendants in an action commenced on June 4,
2001 by C.H.  Fenstermaker  & Associates,  Inc.  ("Fenstermaker")  in the United
States District for the Eastern District of Tennessee entitled C.H. Fenstermaker
& Associates, Inc. v. Tengasco, Inc., No. 3:01-CV-283.

The action seeks to recover approximately $365,000 in fees and charges
billed to TPC for  engineering  services  Fenstermaker  claims it  performed  in
connection  with the  planning  and  construction  of Phase II of the  Company's
pipeline  which runs from  Rogersville,  TN to  Kingsport,  TN to serve  Eastman
Chemical  Company and Holston  Army  Ammunition  Plant.  On June 25,  2001,  the
Company  and TPC filed an  answer to the  complaint  denying  liability  for the
billings  claimed,  and  counterclaiming  against Caddum,  Inc.  ("Caddum"),  an
unincorporated  division of Fenstermaker.  The counterclaim  seeks recovery from
Caddum of damages for breach of contract and breach of professional  engineering
standards  caused by the actions of Caddum,  including  unauthorized  deviations
from the pipeline route that caused the Company to incur significant  additional
costs.  These  costs  included  substantial  fees for  concrete  capping  of the
pipeline  as a result of the  pipeline  being  placed to close to the  adjoining
highway right of way. The  counterclaim  further alleges that Caddum damaged the
Company:  by causing  delays in  completing  the  pipeline  by failing to submit
engineering drawings and failing to timely obtain certain x-rays of the pipeline
welds;  its  unauthorized  actions in  ordering  supplies  and  materials;  and,
overbilling  from  the  agreed  contract  rate  for  engineering  services.  The
counterclaim seeks actual damages from Caddum of approximately $475,000,  treble
damages under state law for the overbilling,  and damages to the Company arising
from the delay caused by Caddum in the production  from the Swan Creek field all
in the aggregate  amount of $1.25 million.  The District Court has scheduled the
case for a non-jury  trial on June 19, 2002 before  Judge James H.  Jarvis.  The
Company  believes its  counterclaims  are  meritorious and intends to vigorously
prosecute them and anticipates that, at a minimum, its counterclaims will either
fully  offset or  substantially  reduce  exposure to  liability  for the amounts
claimed by Fenstermaker.

2.   TENGASCO  PIPELINE  CORPORATION  V. JAMES E. LARKIN AND  KATHLEEN A. O
CONNOR, No. 4929J in the Circuit Court for Hawkins County,  Tennessee. This is a
condemnation  proceeding  brought by Tengasco Pipeline  Corporation to acquire a
temporary

<PAGE>


construction  easement  and  permanent  right of way to  maintain  and operate a
portion of Phase I of the Company's pipeline in Hawkins County,  Tennessee.  The
court  granted an order of  possession  to the Company in January,  1998 and the
pipeline has been constructed  across  approximately  3,000 feet of the property
concerned in a rural and very steep locale. The Company has had the right of way
appraised at $4,000.  The  landowners,  Mr.  Larkin and Kathleen A. O Connor who
both live on the property, contest the appraised value of the property and claim
incidental  damages  to  certain  fish  ponds  located  on their  property.  The
landowners,  despite  a lack of  evidence  of any fish  raising  or  aquaculture
business actually being or having been operated on the premises or of any actual
losses to such  business,  have  counterclaimed  for  $867,585  in  compensatory
damages and $2.6 million in punitive  damages  arising  from  trespass and other
legal  theories.  The Court  required  the  parties to  attempt to mediate  this
dispute and the mediation occurred in December, 2000. The parties were unable to
reach a mediated  settlement  and the matter is  expected  to go to trial in the
summer or fall of 2001.  The  discovery  conducted to date has not disclosed any
facts that reasonably suggest any likelihood of a substantial  adverse result in
this matter, and the Company intends to vigorously defend the allegations of the
counterclaim which appear to be without any credible basis.

3.   The Company, its Chief Executive Officer,  Malcolm E. Ratliff, and one
of its attorneys,  Morton S. Robson,  have been named as defendants in an action
commenced  in the  Supreme  Court of the  State  of New  York,  New York  County
entitled MAUREEN COLEMAN, JOHN O. KOHLER, CHARLES MASSOUD,  JONATHAN SARLIN, VON
GRAFFENRIED A.G. AND VPM VERWATUNGS A.G.,  PLAINTIFFS V. TENGASCO,  INC., MORTON
S. ROBSON AND  MALCOLM E.  RATLIFF,  DEFENDANTS,  INDEX NO.  603009/98.  In that
action,  the  plaintiffs,  shareholders  of the Company each of which  purchased
restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock,  allege that although they were
entitled to sell their shares pursuant to SEC Rule 144 in the open market,  they
were precluded from doing so by the defendants'  purported  wrongful  refusal to
remove the  restrictive  legend from their  shares.  The  plaintiffs  own in the
aggregate  35,000  shares of the  Company's  common stock.  The  plaintiffs  are
seeking  damages in an amount  equal to the  difference  between the amount they
would have been able to sell their shares if the  plaintiffs had acted to remove
the  restrictive  legends when requested and the amount they will receive on the
sale of their shares.  The  plaintiffs are also seeking  punitive  damages in an
amount they claim to be in excess of $500,000 together with interest,  costs and
disbursements of bringing the action,  including  reasonable attorneys fees.

The Company  believes that there are several  substantial  factual and
legal  issues as to the date on which the  shareholders  were  entitled  to sell
their stock pursuant to Rule 144.  Management  further believes that the Company
did not  wrongfully  withhold  its  approval of the  removal of the  restrictive
legends at the times such removal was requested by the shareholders. However, in
the event the Company is found to have  improperly  withheld its  permission  to
remove the restrictive  legends from the shares owned by the  shareholders,  the
Company may be held liable for damages to the shareholders in an amount equal to
the difference  between the actual sale price of such shares and the sales price
they would have realized on the date such restrictive legends

<PAGE>


should have been  permitted  to be removed.  As this time it is not  possible to
ascertain with any certainty what such damages would be.

4.   Tengasco  Pipeline  Corporation  is a party to a  binding  arbitration
proceeding  pursuant to its  construction  contract with King Pipeline & Utility
Company,  Inc. to construct  Phase II of its pipeline.  The arbitration was held
October 10,  2001 under  procedures  of and by an  arbitrator  appointed  by the
American  Arbitration  Association.  The ruling of the arbitrator is expected in
the next thirty days. Tengasco's position is that (1) straw matting done by King
on  slopes  was  extra  work,  and  King is  entitled  to be  paid no more  than
$14,630.14 for 104,501 square feet of straw matting on slopes,  calculated at 14
cents per square foot rather than the two dollars per square foot sought by King
; (2) King should  refund to Tengasco the $72,500  mistakenly  paid for clearing
and grubbing that was never  performed by King because the pipeline took another
route where no clearing and grubbing was required; (3) that a currently retained
sum of  $46,585,  to which  Tengasco  makes no claim,  remain in escrow  pending
outcome of ongoing litigation between King and King's boring subcontractor,  (4)
that King is not  entitled  to  receive  any of the  $94,000  billed by King for
certain  alleged  extra work in  trenching,  because a change order seeking this
payment was not  submitted  until months after all work was  completed,  and (5)
that Tengasco is entitled to recover its attorney's  fees.  Tengasco  expects in
the  aggregate  of the  rulings on these  issues,  a  favorable  outcome of this
arbitration that either results in positive  recovery by the Company or a result
that is not materially adverse.

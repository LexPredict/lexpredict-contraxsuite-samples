<PAGE>   19

A Money Market Quote may set forth up to five separate offers by the quoting
Bank with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation
for Money Market Quotes.

(iii) Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it:

(A) is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D hereto
or does not specify all of the information required by subsection
(d)(ii);

(B) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language;

(C) proposes terms other than or in addition to those set
forth in the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or

(D) arrives after the time set forth in subsection (d)(i).

(e) Notice to Borrower. The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of
the terms (x) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is in
accordance with subsection (d) and (y) of any Money Market Quote that amends,
modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote
submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request. Any
such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Agent unless such
subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in
such former Money Market Quote. The Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify
(A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which offers have
been received for each Interest Period specified in the related Money Market
Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Money Market Margins or
Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered (including the names
of the Banks) and (C) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal
amount of Money Market Loans for which offers in any single Money Market Quote
for any Interest Period may be accepted.

(f) Acceptance and Notice by Borrower. Not later than 10:30 A.M. (New
York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the proposed
date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the proposed date of
Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in either case, such
other time or date as the Borrower and the Agent shall have mutually agreed upon
and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of the Money Market
Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate Auction for which
such change is to be effective), the Borrower shall notify the Agent of its
acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it pursuant to
subsection (e). In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of Money
Market Borrowing") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for
each Interest Period that are accepted. The
<PAGE>   20
16



Borrower may accept any Money Market Quote for any Interest Period in whole or
in part; provided that:

(i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market
Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related
Money Market Quote Request,

(ii) the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must
be $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000,

(iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of
ascending Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the
case may be, and

(iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described
in subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the
requirements of this Agreement.

(g) Allocation by Agent. If offers are made by two or more Banks with
the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may
be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which
such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount
of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be
allocated by the Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of
such number, not greater than $1,000,000 as the Agent may deem appropriate) in
proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by
the Agent of the pro rata amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error.

SECTION 2.04. Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans. (a) Upon receipt of a
Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents
thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of such Borrowing and such Notice of
Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

(b) Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of each
Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall make available its share of
such Borrowing, in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York
City, to the Agent at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 10.01.
Unless the Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article
III has not been satisfied, the Agent will make the funds so received from the
Banks available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.

(c) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to
the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent
such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has
made such share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 2.04 and the Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall

<PAGE>   21
17


not have so made such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower
severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the higher
of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to
Section 2.08 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such
Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid
shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of
this Agreement.

SECTION 2.05. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Bank shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such
Bank, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such
Bank from time to time hereunder.

Commitment of each Bank and the amount of each Loan made hereunder by such Bank,

sum received by the Agent hereunder for the accounts of the Banks and each
Bank's share thereof.

(c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations recorded therein and shall be presumptively correct absent
demonstrable error; provided that the failure of the Agent to maintain such
accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of
the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Any Bank may request in writing that Loans made by it be evidenced
by a Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to
such Bank a Note payable to the order of such Bank in the form of Exhibit A.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all
times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.05) be represented by
one or more Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein.

(e) Each Bank agrees that it will cancel and return to the Borrower all
Notes then held by it upon the earlier of (i) the Termination Date provided no

three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent, ratably reduce the
Commitments from time to time by an aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or any
larger multiple of $1,000,000, but only to the extent that the aggregate amount
of the Commitments exceeds the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
Loans.

SECTION 2.08. Interest Rates. (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date
such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base

the earlier of (i) the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto or
(ii) the Termination Date. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted

provided that, if for any reason such rate is not available, the term "London
Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period shall mean, the rate
per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/32 of 1%) appearing
on Reuters Screen LIBO Page (or any successor page) as the London interbank
offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London
time) two Euro-Dollar Business Days before the first day of such Interest Period
for a period equal to such Interest Period, provided, however, if more than one
rate is specified on Reuters Screen LIBO Page (or any successor page), the
applicable rate shall be the arithmetic mean of all such rates.

(d) Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by law,
overdue interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand,
for each day from and including the date payment thereof was due to but
excluding the date of actual payment, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1%
plus the Euro-Dollar Margin plus the higher of (i) the London Interbank Offered
Rate applicable to such Loan and (ii) the average (rounded upward, if necessary,
to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which one
day (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar Business
Days, then for such other period of time not longer than three months as the
Agent may select) deposits in dollars in an amount approximately equal to such
overdue payment due to the Agent are offered to the Agent in the London
interbank market for the applicable period determined as provided above (or, if
the circumstances described in Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of 1% plus the Base Rate for such day).

(e) Subject to clause (y) of Section 8.01, each Money Market LIBOR Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the
Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period plus (or minus) the Money
Market Margin quoted by the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section
2.03. Each Money Market Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by
the Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Such interest shall
be payable for each Interest Period on the earlier of (i) the last day thereof,
(ii) three months after the initial date thereof and, if such Interest Period is
longer than three months, at intervals of three months thereafter or (iii) the
Termination Date. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by law,
overdue interest on any Money Market Loan shall bear interest, payable on
demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 1% plus
the Base Rate for such day.

(f) The Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the
Loans hereunder. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower by telecopy
and the participating Banks by telex, cable or telecopy of each rate of interest
so determined, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error.

(g) Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to furnish
quotations to the Agent as contemplated by this Section. If any Reference Bank
does not furnish a timely quotation, the Agent shall determine the relevant
interest rate on the basis of the quotation or quotations furnished by the
remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of such quotations is available on
a timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply.

SECTION 2.09. Fees.

(a) Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account
of the Banks ratably in proportion to their Commitments, a facility fee at the
rate of (i) 0.065% per annum during each Level I Period, (ii) 0.070% per annum
during each Level II Period, (iii) 0.080% per annum during each Level III

the conditions set forth in Section 3.01(a) and (d) have been satisfied to but
excluding the last day of the Revolving Credit Period, in each case, on the
daily average aggregate amount of the Commitments (whether used or unused) and
(ii) if any Loans remain outstanding after the Revolving Credit Period, from and
including the last day of the Revolving Credit Period to but excluding the date
such Loans shall be repaid in full, on the daily average aggregate outstanding
principal amount of such Loans.

(b) Payments. Except as otherwise indicated, accrued fees under this
Section shall be payable quarterly in arrears on (i) each Quarterly Date, (ii)
the Termination Date and (iii) if any Loans remain outstanding after the
Revolving Credit Period, the date such Loans shall be repaid in full.

SECTION 2.10. Method of Electing Interest Rates. (a) The Loans included
in each Committed Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate
specified by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of Committed Borrowing.
Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the
type of interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject in each case to the
provisions of Article VIII), as follows:

(i) if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the Borrower may elect
to convert such Loans to CD Loans as of any Domestic Business Day or
Euro- Dollar Loans as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day;

(ii) if such Loans are CD Loans, the Borrower may (x) elect to
convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans as of any Domestic Business Day,
(y) elect to convert such Loans to Euro-Dollar Loans or to CD Loans
with an Interest Period different from the then current Interest Period
applicable to such Loans, as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day or
Domestic Business Day, respectively, or (z) elect to continue such
Loans as CD

<PAGE>   29
25


Loans for an additional Interest Period beginning on the last day of
the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans; and

(iii) if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower may
(x) elect to convert such Loans to Base Rate Loans or CD Loans as of
any Domestic Business Day, (y) elect to convert such Loans to CD Loans
or Euro-Dollar Loans with an Interest Period different from the then
current Interest Period applicable to such Loans, as of any Domestic
Business Day or Euro-Dollar Business Day, respectively, or (z) elect to
continue such Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest
Period beginning on the last day of the then current Interest Period
applicable to such Loans;

provided that, if the Borrower elects to convert any CD Loans or Euro-Dollar
Loans, as the case may be, to Base Rate Loans or to CD Loans or Euro-Dollar
Loans, as the case may be, with a different Interest Period, as of any day other
than the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans,
the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank in accordance with Section 2.13.

Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a "Notice of
Interest Rate Election") to the Agent (i) at least one Domestic Business Day
before such notice is to be effective if the relevant Loans are to be converted
into Base Rate Loans, (ii) at least two Domestic Business Days before such
conversion or continuation is to be effective if such Loans are to be converted
into, or continued as, CD Rate Loans or (iii) at least three Euro-Dollar
Business Days before such conversion or continuation is to be effective if such
Loans are to be converted into, or continued as, Euro-Dollar Loans.

A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to
only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans;
provided that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising
such Group and (ii) the portion to which such Notice applies, and the remaining
portion to which it does not apply, are each $25,000,000 or any larger multiple
of $1,000,000.

(b)  Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:

(i) the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such
notice applies;

(ii) the date on which the conversion or continuation selected
in such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the
applicable clause of subsection (a) above;

(iii) whether such Group of Loans (or portion thereof) is to
be converted to Base Rate Loans, CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans or
continued as CD Loans or
<PAGE>   30
26


Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period; and

(iv) if such Loans (or portions thereof) are to be converted
to or continued as CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be,
the duration of the Interest Period to be applicable thereto
immediately after such conversion or continuation.

Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall
comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

(c) Upon receipt of a Notice of Interest Rate Election from the
Borrower pursuant to subsection (a) above, the Agent shall promptly notify each
Bank of the contents thereof and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable
by the Borrower. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Notice of Interest
Rate Election to the Agent for any Group of Fixed Rate Loans, such Loans shall
be converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the then current Interest
Period applicable thereto.

SECTION 2.11. Optional Prepayments. (a) The Borrower may (i) upon at
least one Domestic Business Day's notice to the Agent, prepay the Base Rate
Loans (or any Money Market LIBOR Loans which bear interest at the Base Rate at
such time for the reason stated in Section 8.01), in whole or in part, on any
Domestic Business Day and (ii) upon at least two Euro-Dollar Business Days'
notice to the Agent, prepay any Fixed Rate Loan, in whole or in part, in amounts
aggregating $25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000, by paying the
principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the
date of prepayment; provided that Money Market Loans may not be prepaid other
than as contemplated by clause (i) above. Each such optional prepayment shall be
applied to prepay ratably the relevant Loans of the several Banks. Prepayment of
a Fixed Rate Loan on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period
applicable thereto shall be subject to Section 2.13.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section,
the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such
Bank's ratable share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.12. General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall
make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees
hereunder, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date when due,
in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Agent
at its address referred to in its Administrative Questionnaire. The Agent will
promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received
by the Agent for the account of the Banks. Whenever any payment of principal of,
or interest on, any Base Rate Loans, CD Loans or fees shall be due on a day
which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be
extended to the next succeeding Domestic

<PAGE>   31
27


Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Euro-Dollar Loans and Money Market LIBOR Loans shall be due on a day which is
not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended
to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business
Day falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof
shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day. Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Money Market Absolute Loans shall be due on a
day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day. If the date for any
payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest
thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior
to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the Borrower
will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has
made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due
date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that
the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the
Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal
Funds Rate.

SECTION 2.13. Funding Losses. If the Borrower makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan or any Fixed Rate Loan is
converted to another Loan (pursuant to Section 2.10, Section 2.11, Article VI or
Article VIII) on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period
applicable thereto or the end of an applicable period fixed pursuant to Section
2.08(d), or if any Bank assigns any Fixed Rate Loan as required by Section 8.06
on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or
if the Borrower fails to borrow or prepay any Fixed Rate Loan after notice has
been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.04(a) or Section 2.11, the
Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand for any resulting
loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or prospective Participant in
the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss reasonably incurred
in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but
excluding loss of margin for the period after such payment or conversion or
assignment or failure to borrow or prepay, provided that such Bank shall have
delivered to the Borrower a certificate as to the amount of such loss or expense
with an explanation of the calculation of such loss or expense, which
certificate shall be conclusive if made reasonably and in good faith.

SECTION 2.14. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the
Prime Rate hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or
366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). All other interest and
facility fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360

<PAGE>   32
28


days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

SECTION 2.15. Regulation D Compensation. For each day for which a Bank
is required to maintain reserves in respect of either (x) "Eurocurrency
Liabilities" (as defined in all regulations of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System) or (y) any other category of liabilities which includes
deposits by reference to which the interest rate in Euro-Dollar Loans is
determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which
includes loans by a non-United States office of any Bank to United States
residents, such Bank may require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with
each payment of interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans, additional interest on the
related Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum determined by such
Bank up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate divided by (B) one minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage over (ii) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate. Any Bank
wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the
Borrower and the Agent, in which case such additional interest on the
Euro-Dollar Loans of such Bank shall be payable to such Bank at the place
indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at
least five Euro-Dollar Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y)
shall notify the Borrower at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to each
date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Dollar Loans of the amount then
due to such Bank under this Section. Such Bank's notice to the Borrower shall
set forth its calculation of such additional interest and such calculation shall
be conclusive if made reasonably and in good faith.

foregoing shall not prohibit (i) the termination of the existence of any
Principal Subsidiary if the surviving entity (in the case of any such
termination resulting from a merger or consolidation) or the entity to which
substantially all such Principal Subsidiary's assets are transferred (in the
case of any other such termination) is or becomes a Principal Subsidiary, or
(ii) any transaction involving the Borrower or the Guarantor in accordance with
Section 5.05.

SECTION 5.03. Minimum Adjusted Consolidated Net Worth. Adjusted
Consolidated Net Worth will not be less than $7,500,000,000 at any time.

SECTION 5.04. Equal and Ratable Lien Protection. Neither the Borrower
nor the Guarantor will, nor will they permit any Principal Subsidiary to, issue,
assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money secured by a
mortgage, pledge, lien or other encumbrance, directly or indirectly on any of
the common stock of a Principal Subsidiary or of the Borrower, which common
stock is owned by the Guarantor, the Borrower or any Principal Subsidiary,
unless the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and any Notes and,
if the Borrower or the Guarantor so elects, any other indebtedness of the
Borrower or the Guarantor ranking on a parity with the Borrower's obligations
under this Agreement, any Notes or the Guarantor's obligations under Article IX,
as applicable, shall be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such
secured indebtedness for borrowed money so long as it is outstanding and is so
secured.

SECTION 5.05. Consolidations, Mergers and Sales of Assets. Neither the
Borrower nor the Guarantor will consolidate or merge with or into any other
corporation or convey or transfer its properties and assets substantially as an
entirety to any other Person unless (i) the surviving or acquiring entity is a
corporation organized under the laws of one of the United States, (ii) the
surviving or acquiring corporation, if other than the Borrower or the Guarantor,
as applicable, expressly assumes the performance of the obligations of the
Borrower or the Guarantor, as applicable, under this Agreement and all Notes,
and (iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default shall
exist; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to prevent a merger of
the Borrower with the Guarantor, in which case the survivor shall be or become
both the Borrower hereunder and the Guarantor.

SECTION 5.06. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans made under
this Agreement will be used by the Borrower for general corporate purposes. None
of such proceeds will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether
immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying any "margin stock"
within the meaning of Regulation U.

SECTION 5.07. Cross Default Provisions. If a cross default provision is
included in any future instrument or agreement of the Borrower or the Guarantor
evidencing or relating to indebtedness for borrowed money in a principal amount
in excess of $50,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency), the Borrower
and the Guarantor will promptly notify the Banks thereof and will, if requested
to do so by the Required Banks, sign an amendment to this Agreement to include a
similar cross default provision herein.

SECTION 5.08. Compliance with Laws. Each of the Borrower and the
Guarantor will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, except
where any single failure to comply therewith would not individually have a
material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations hereunder, and
except where necessity of compliance therewith is being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings; provided, however, that with respect to its
compliance with ERISA, this Section 5.08 applies to each of the Borrower and the
Guarantor only in its capacity as an employer and not in any other capacity
(such as a fiduciary or service provider to Plans for the benefit of employers
of others); and provided further that the reference to applicable laws in this
Section 5.08 shall not include Environmental Laws.

terminate the Commitments and they shall thereupon terminate, and (ii) if
requested by Banks holding more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the

the Borrower.

SECTION 7.01. Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank irrevocably
appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by
the terms hereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.

SECTION 7.02. Agent and Affiliates. Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
New York shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other
Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not
the Agent, and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York and its affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if
it were not the Agent hereunder.

SECTION 7.03. Action by Agent. The obligations of the Agent hereunder
are only those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Agent shall not be required to take any action with respect
to any Default, except as expressly provided in Article VI.

SECTION 7.04. Consultation with Experts. The Agent may consult with
legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower or the Guarantor),
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 7.05. Liability of Agent. Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents, or employees shall be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it in connection herewith (i) with the consent or at the request
of the Required Banks or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents
or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire
into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection
with this Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower or the
Guarantor; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article III,
except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Agent; or (iv) the
validity, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other instrument
or writing furnished in connection herewith. The Agent shall not incur any
liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate,
statement, or other writing (which may be a bank wire, telex or

<PAGE>   42
38


similar writing) reasonably believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the
proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.06. Indemnification. Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance
with its Commitment, indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the
Borrower) against any cost, expense (including counsel fees and disbursements),
claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from the Agent's
gross negligence or willful misconduct) that the Agent may suffer or incur in
connection with this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent
hereunder.

SECTION 7.07. Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based

giving written notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent approved by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld). If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required
Banks, and approved by the Borrower and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of resignation, then the
retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which
shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United
States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and
surplus of at least two billion dollars. Upon the acceptance of its appointment
as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring
Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent.

SECTION 7.09. Agent's Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for
its own account, fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Agent.


ARTICLE VIII

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

SECTION 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair.
If (i) on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar
Loan or Money Market LIBOR
<PAGE>   43
39


Loan the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error) that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not
generally available in the London interbank market for such period or that the
London Interbank Offered Rate cannot be determined in accordance with the
definition thereof, or (ii) on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period
for any CD Loan the Agent is advised by each of the Reference Banks that
deposits in dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to each of
the Reference Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, the Agent
shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon
until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Banks to make CD Loans or
Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, or to convert outstanding Base Rate Loans
into CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, or to convert
outstanding CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans into CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as
the case may be, with a different Interest Period shall be suspended, (ii) each
outstanding CD Loan, Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market LIBOR Loan, as the case
may be, shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the then
current Interest Period applicable thereto, and (iii) unless the Borrower
notifies the Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date of any CD
Borrowing, Euro-Dollar Borrowing or Money Market LIBOR Borrowing, as the case
may be, for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been given that it elects
not to borrow on such date, (x) if such Borrowing is a CD Borrowing or a
Euro-Dollar Borrowing, as the case may be, such Borrowing shall instead be made
as a Base Rate Borrowing and (y) if such Borrowing is a Money Market LIBOR
Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall bear
interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day.

SECTION 8.02. Illegality. If, on or after the date of this Agreement,
the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any
applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or its
Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans and
such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice
thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies
the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension
no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans, or to
convert outstanding Base Rate Loans or CD Loans into Euro-Dollar Loans, or to
convert outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans into Euro-Dollar Loans with a different
Interest Period shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Agent
pursuant to this Section, such Bank shall designate a different Applicable
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice
and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to

<PAGE>   44
40


such Bank. If such notice is given, all Euro-Dollar Loans of such Bank then
outstanding shall be converted to Base Rate Loans either (a) on the last day of
the then current Interest Period applicable to such Euro-Dollar Loans if such
Bank may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loans to such day or (b)
immediately if such Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such
Loans to such day.

SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If any applicable
law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency, made or adopted after the date hereof (other than a change currently
provided for in any existing law, rule or regulation) shall impose, modify or
deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, insurance assessment or similar
requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding (i) with respect
to any Euro-Dollar Loan, any such requirement with respect to which such Bank is
entitled to compensation during the relevant Interest Period under Section 2.15
and (ii) with respect to any CD Loan, any such requirement reflected in the
applicable Domestic Reserve Percentage or Assessment Rate) against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any Bank (or its Applicable
Lending Office) or on the United States market for certificates of deposit or
the London interbank market any other condition affecting its Fixed Rate Loans
(other than Money Market Absolute Rate Loans), its Note (in respect of such
Fixed Rate Loans) or its obligation to make such Fixed Rate Loans; and the
result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its
Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with respect
thereto, by an amount reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then,
within 15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction.

(b) If any Bank shall have determined that any applicable law, rule or
regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or
regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, made or adopted after
the date hereof (other than a change currently provided for in any existing law,
rule or regulation), has or would have the effect of increasing the amount of
capital of such Bank (or its parent) required to be maintained

<PAGE>   45
41


in respect of, or otherwise allocated to, such Bank's obligations hereunder (its
"Required Capital") by an amount reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material,
then such Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Agent, increase the
facility fee payable to such Bank hereunder to the extent required so that the
ratio of (w) the sum of the increased facility fee applicable to such Bank's
Commitment hereunder to (x) the prior facility fee applicable to such Bank's
Commitment hereunder is the same as the ratio of (y) such Bank's increased
Required Capital to (z) its prior Required Capital. Such Bank's notice to the
Borrower and the Agent shall set forth its calculation of the foregoing ratios
and the increased facility fee to which it is entitled under this Section.

(c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any
event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.03 (each, a
"Trigger Event") and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if
such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section, no Bank shall be entitled to any compensation pursuant to this Section
in respect of any Trigger Event (i) for any period of time in excess of 120 days
prior to such notice or (ii) for any period of time prior to such notice if such
Bank shall not have given such notice within 120 days of the date on which such
Trigger Event shall have been enacted, promulgated, adopted or issued in
definitive or final form unless such Trigger Event is retroactive. A certificate
of any Bank claiming compensation under Section 8.03(a) or (b) and setting forth
the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and describing the
method of calculation thereof shall be conclusive if made reasonably and in good
faith. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging
and attribution methods.

SECTION 8.04. Taxes. (a) For purposes of this Section 8.04, the
following terms have the following meanings:

"Taxes" means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Agent, taxes
imposed on its income, and franchise or similar taxes imposed on it, by a
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be)
is organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the
case of each Bank, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located and (ii) in
the case of each Bank, any United States withholding tax imposed on such
payments but only to the extent that such Bank is subject to United States
withholding tax at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this Agreement.

"Other Taxes" means any present or future stamp or documentary taxes
and any other excise or property taxes, or
<PAGE>   46
42


similar charges or levies, which arise from any payment made pursuant to this
Agreement or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise
with respect to, this Agreement or any Note.

(b) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any
Bank or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made without deduction
for any Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that, if the Borrower shall be required
by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from any such payments, (i) the sum
payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 8.04) such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law and (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent,
at its address referred to in Section 10.01, the original or a certified copy of
a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

(c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Agent for the
full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under
this Section 8.04) paid by such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) and any
liability (including penalties, interest and expenses, except to the extent
attributable to the negligence or misconduct of such Bank or the Agent, as the
case may be) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification
shall be made within 15 days from the date such Bank or the Agent (as the case
may be) makes demand therefor.

(d) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof and on
or prior to the date on which it becomes a Bank in the case of each other Bank,
shall provide the Borrower with (i) two Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") forms
1001 or any successor form prescribed by the IRS, certifying that such Bank is
entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a
party which exempts such Bank from United States withholding tax or reduces the
rate of withholding tax on payments of interest and eliminates withholding tax
on any fees, or (ii) two IRS forms 4224 certifying that the income receivable
pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
or business in the United States. If the form provided by a Bank indicates a
United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax
at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" as defined in Section
8.04(a). Each such Bank undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the
Agent (A) a replacement form (or successor form) on or before the date that such
form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent form so delivered by it, and (B) such amendments
thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as

<PAGE>   47
43


may reasonably be required (but only so long as such Bank remains lawfully able
to do so).

(e) For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide
the Borrower with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.04(d) (unless such
failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to
the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Bank
shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.04(b) or Section
8.04(c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a
Bank, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding
tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably
request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.

(f) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any
event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle such Bank to make any claim for indemnification in respect of Taxes or
Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 8.04 (each, a "Tax Event") and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid
the need for, or reduce the amount of, such claim or any other amounts payable
by the Borrower under this Section 8.04 and will not, in the judgment of such
Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Section, no Bank shall be entitled to any indemnification
pursuant to this Section in respect of any Tax Event (i) for any period of time
in excess of 180 days prior to such notice or (ii) for any period of time prior
to such notice if such Bank shall not have given such notice within 120 days of
the date on which such Bank became aware of such Tax Event unless such Tax Event
is retroactive.

SECTION 8.05. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar
Loans. If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Euro-Dollar Loans
has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded
compensation under Section 8.03(a) and the Borrower shall, by at least five
Euro-Dollar Business Days prior notice to such Bank through the Agent, have
elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then,
unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply:

(a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as
(or continued as or converted into) Euro-Dollar Loans shall instead be
Base Rate Loans, and

(b) after each of its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans has been
repaid (or converted to a Base Rate Loan), all payments of principal
which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar Loans shall
be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

If such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer apply, the Borrower shall elect that the principal amount of
each such Base Rate Loan shall be
<PAGE>   48
44


converted into a Euro-Dollar Loan on the first day of the next succeeding
Interest Period applicable to the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks.

SECTION 8.06. Substitution of Bank. If (i) the obligation of any Bank
to make Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii)
any Bank has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04, the Borrower
shall have the right to seek a substitute bank or banks ("Substitute Banks")
(which may be one or more of the Banks) to purchase the Loans and assume the
Commitment of such Bank (the "Affected Bank") under this Agreement and, if the
Borrower locates a Substitute Bank, the Affected Bank shall, upon payment to it
of the purchase price agreed between it and the Substitute Bank (or, failing
such agreement, a purchase price in the amount of the outstanding principal
amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon to the date of payment) plus
any amount (other than principal and interest) then due to it or accrued for its
account hereunder, assign all its rights and obligations under this Agreement
and all of its Notes to the Substitute Bank, and the Substitute Bank shall
assume such rights and obligations, whereupon the Substitute Bank shall be a
Bank party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a
Bank.

SECTION 8.07. Election to Terminate. If during any Level I Period,
Level II Period or Level III Period (i) the obligation of any Bank to make
Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank
has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04, the Borrower may elect to
terminate this Agreement as to such Bank, and in connection therewith not to
borrow any Loan hereunder from such Bank or to prepay any Base Rate Loan made
pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.05 (without altering the Commitments or Loans of
the remaining Banks), provided that the Borrower (i) notifies such Bank through
the Agent of such election at least two Euro-Dollar Business Days before any
date fixed for such borrowing or such a prepayment, as the case may be, and (ii)
repays all of such Bank's outstanding Loans, accrued interest thereon and any
other amounts then due to such Bank or accrued for its account hereunder
concurrently with such termination. Upon receipt by the Agent of such notice,
the Commitment of such Bank shall terminate.



ARTICLE IX

GUARANTY

The Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not
merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment of principal of and interest on
the Loans, when and as due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by notice of
prepayment or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Borrower to
the Agent and the Banks under this Agreement and any Notes (collectively, the
"Obligations"). Subject to Section 10.04, the Guarantor further agrees that the
Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or
further assent
<PAGE>   49
45


from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any
extension or renewal of any Obligation.

The Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest
to the Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance
of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the
Guarantor under this Article IX shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the
Agent or any Bank to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
remedy against the Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise;
(b) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, any Note or any other agreement (other than an
amendment to this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement, but then only to
the extent expressly affected by such amendment); (c) the release of any
security held by the Agent or any Bank for the Obligations; or (d) the failure
of the Agent or any Bank to exercise any right or remedy against any other
guarantor of the Obligations.

The Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee constitutes a guarantee
of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that
any resort be had by the Agent or any Bank to any security held for payment of
the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books
of the Agent or any Bank in favor of the Borrower or any other Person.

The obligations of the Guarantor under this Article IX shall not be
subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason,
including, without limitation, any claim of waiver, release, surrender,
alteration or compromise of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any
defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason
of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or
otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of
the Guarantor under this Article IX shall not be discharged or impaired or
otherwise affected by the failure of the Agent or any Bank to assert any claim
or demand or to enforce any remedy under any guarantee or any other agreement,
by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay,
wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or by any other act
or omission which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of
the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of the Guarantor as a matter
of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full of all the
Obligations).

The Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any
part hereof, of principal of or interest on any Obligation (including, without
limitation, any payment pursuant to this Article IX) is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored by the Agent or any Bank upon the bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise.

In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other
right which the Agent or any Bank may have at law or

<PAGE>   50
46


in equity against the Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the
Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the
Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the
Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Agent for distribution to the
Banks, if and as appropriate, in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation. The
Guarantor agrees that any claim or right that the Guarantor may have against the
Borrower by way of subrogation or otherwise in respect of any payment that the
Guarantor may be required to make hereunder shall be subject and subordinated to
the claims of the Agent and the Banks against the Borrower in respect of the
Obligations.

The guarantee made hereunder shall survive and be in full force and
effect so long as any Obligation is outstanding and has not been indefeasibly
paid and so long as the Banks have any further commitment to lend and shall be
reinstated to the extent provided above.


ARTICLE X

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 10.01. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications
to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire, telex,
facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (x)
in the case of the Borrower, the Guarantor or the Agent, at its address or telex
or telecopy number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (y) in the case of
any Bank, at its address, telex or telecopy number set forth in its
Administrative Questionnaire or (z) in the case of any party, such other address
or telex or telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose
by notice to the Agent, the Borrower and the Guarantor. All notices from outside
the United States to the Borrower or the Guarantor shall only be given by
telecopy and all other notices to the Borrower or the Guarantor given by telex
shall also be given by telecopy or non-telex method. Each such notice, request
or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telex or telecopy,
when such telex or telecopy is transmitted to the number determined pursuant to
this Section and the appropriate answerback is received, (ii) if given by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, when such return receipt
is signed by the recipient or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered
at the address specified in this Section, or, if such date is not a business day
in the location where received, on the next business day in such location;
provided that notices to the Agent under Article II or Article VIII shall not be
effective until received.

SECTION 10.02. No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Agent or any Bank
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be
<PAGE>   51
47


cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

SECTION 10.03. Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Borrower shall pay
(i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, including reasonable fees and
disbursements of special counsel for the Agent (subject to the limitations
previously agreed with such counsel, in the case of fees payable in connection
with the preparation of this Agreement), in connection with the preparation of
this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any amendment hereof or any
Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent or any Bank, including fees and
disbursements of counsel, in connection with such Event of Default and
collection and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.

(b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and hold each Bank
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, claims, losses, damages,
costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by any Bank (or by the
Agent in connection with its actions as Agent hereunder) in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Bank
shall be designated a party thereto) relating to or arising out of (i) any
actual or proposed use of proceeds of Loans hereunder to acquire equity
securities of any other Person or (ii) any transaction which violates the change
in control provisions set forth in Section 6.01(i); provided that no Bank shall
have the right to be indemnified hereunder for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 10.04. Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement
or the Notes may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and is signed by the Borrower, the Guarantor and the Required
Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the
Agent); provided that no such amendment or waiver shall, unless signed by all
the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment of any Bank or subject any
Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce or forgive the principal of or
rate of interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date
fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees
hereunder or for any reduction or termination of any Commitment, (iv) release
the Guarantor generally from, or limit or reduce, its liability under Article IX
or (v) amend this Section or otherwise change the percentage of the Commitments
or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of
Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action
under this Section or any other provision of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.05. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not
assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under
this
<PAGE>   52
48


Agreement (other than as contemplated by Section 5.05) without the prior written
consent of all Banks.

(b) Except for (i) any assignment made with the Borrower's consent,
which consent shall be at the Borrower's sole discretion unless the Assignee is
an Affiliate of the transferor Bank, in which case, such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (ii) any grant of participating interests permitted by
subsection (d) below and (iii) any designation of a different Applicable Lending
Office required by Section 8.02, Section 8.03 or Section 8.04, no Bank may at
any time assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement or any Note. An assignment or other transfer which is not
permitted by this subsection (b) shall be given effect for purposes of this
Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest granted in accordance
with subsection (d) below.

(c) Subject to the requirements of subsection (b) above, any Bank may
assign to one or more banks or other institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a
proportionate part of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
and any Notes, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations,
pursuant to an instrument executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank,
with (and subject to) the subscribed consent of the Borrower and the Agent. Upon
execution and delivery of such an instrument and payment by such Assignee to
such transferor Bank of an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between
such transferor Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to
this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a
Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor
Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent,
and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. In connection
with any such assignment, except an assignment made pursuant to Section 8.06,
the transferor Bank shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing
such assignment in the amount of $2,000. Upon the consummation of any assignment
pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Borrower
shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued
to the Assignee. If the Assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof, it shall, prior to the first date
on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to the
Borrower and the Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section
8.04.

(d) Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other
institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in any or all of its
Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a
Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such Bank
shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and
the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a
<PAGE>   53
49


participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right
and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrower hereunder
including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification
or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such participation
agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification,
amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of
Section 10.04 without the consent of the Participant. The Borrower agrees that
each Participant shall, to the extent provided in its participation agreement,
be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participating
interest.

(e) No Participant or other transferee of any Bank's rights shall be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 8.03 or 8.04 than such
Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred,
unless such transfer is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by
reason of the provisions of Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.04 requiring such Bank to
designate a different Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances.

(f) Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release
the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

SECTION 10.06. New York Law. This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

SECTION 10.07. Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.

SECTION 10.08. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE
GUARANTOR, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
<PAGE>   54
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year

precedent to such Loan have been met Lender will on the date requested promptly
remit to such Borrower the amount of such Loan in immediately available dollars,

Eurodollar Loans to Base Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, and to continue Eurodollar Loans beyond the expiration of
such Interest Period by designating a new Interest Period to take effect at the

such election, a Borrower must give to Lender written notice (or telephonic

existing Loans, with a separate notice given for each new Borrowing. Each such
notice constitutes a "Continuation/Conversion Notice" hereunder and must:

(a)      specify the existing Loans which are to be Continued
or Converted;

(b)      specify (i) the aggregate amount of any Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans into which such existing Loans are to be continued or

warranty, acknowledgment and agreement by the Borrower giving such notice as to
the matters which are required to be set out in such written confirmation. Each
Continuation/Conversion Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on such
Borrower. During the continuance of any Default, no Borrower may make any
election to convert existing Loans into Eurodollar Loans or continue existing
Loans as Eurodollar Loans. If (due to the existence of a Default or for any
other reason) a Borrower fails to timely and properly give any
Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to a Borrowing of existing
Eurodollar Loans at least three days prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, such Eurodollar Loans shall automatically be converted into
Base Rate Loans at the end of such Interest Period. No new funds shall be repaid
by a Borrower or


20
<PAGE>

advanced by Lender in connection with any Continuation or Conversion of existing
Loans pursuant to this section, and no such Continuation or Conversion shall be
deemed to be a new advance of funds for any purpose; such Continuations and
Conversions merely constitute a change in the interest rate applicable to
already outstanding Loans.

Note, all payments of principal, including any principal payment made with
proceeds of Mortgage Collateral, and fees hereunder shall be made directly to

Account. The applicable Borrower shall send notice to Lender before 1:00 p.m.
(Dallas, Texas time) on the day any payment of principal or interest is received
by Lender which sets forth the Loans against which such payment is to be
applied. Any payment (or any payment received without a notice regarding
application of such payment) received by Lender after such time will be deemed
to have been made on the next following Business Day. Should any such payment
become due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity of such
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case
of a payment of principal or past due interest, interest shall accrue and be
payable thereon for the period of such extension as provided in the Loan
Document under which such payment is due. Each payment under a Loan Document
shall be payable at the place provided therein and, if no specific place of
payment is provided, shall be payable at the place of payment of the Note. When
Lender collects or receives money on account of the Obligations, Lender shall
apply all such money so distributed, as follows:

(a)      first, for the payment of all Obligations which are
then due, and if such money is insufficient to pay all such
Obligations, (i) first to any reimbursements due Lender under Section
5.5, (ii) second, to the payment of the Loans then due, and (iii) then
to the partial payment of all other Obligations then due in proportion
to the amounts thereof, or as Lender shall otherwise agree;

(b)      then for the prepayment of amounts owing under the
Loan Documents if so specified by Borrowers;

(c)      then for the prepayment of principal on the Note,
together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal so prepaid;
and

(d)      last, for the payment or prepayment of any other
Obligations.

All payments applied to principal or interest on any Note shall be applied first
to any interest then due and payable, then to principal then due and payable,
and last to any prepayment of principal and interest.

Section 2.8       Increased Cost and Reduced Return.

<PAGE>

(a)      If, after the date hereof, there shall occur any change in any
applicable Law, rule, or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank, or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) with any request or
directive issued after the date hereof (whether or not having the force of Law)
of any such governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

(i)      shall subject Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any
Eurodollar Loans, any Note, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans,
or change the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to Lender (or
its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or any Note in
respect of any Eurodollar Loans (other than taxes imposed on the
overall net income of Lender by the jurisdiction in which Lender has
its principal office or such Applicable Lending Office);

(ii)     shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve,
special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than the
Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination of the Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets
of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office), including the commitment of Lender
hereunder; or

(iii)    shall impose on Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting
this Agreement or any Notes or any of such extensions of credit or
liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender (or its
Applicable Lending Office) of making, converting into, continuing, or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or its Notes with
respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then Borrowers shall pay to Lender within
fifteen (15) days after demand by Lender, such amount or amounts as will
compensate Lender for such increased cost or reduction. If Lender requests
compensation by Borrowers under this Section 2.8(a), Borrowers may, by notice to
Lender, suspend the obligation of Lender to make or continue Loans of the Type
with respect to which such compensation is requested, or to convert Loans of any
other Type into Loans of such Type, until the event or condition giving rise to
such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section
2.11 shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the
right of Lender to receive the compensation so requested.

(b)      If, after the date hereof, Lender shall have determined that
the adoption of any applicable Law, rule, or regulation regarding capital
adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of
any such governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency, has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital


22
<PAGE>

of Lender or any corporation controlling Lender, due to the obligations of
Lender hereunder, to a level below that which Lender or such corporation could
have achieved but for such adoption, change, request, or directive (taking into
consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, within
fifteen (15) days after demand by Lender, Borrowers shall pay to Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender for such reduction, but
only to the extent that Lender has not been compensated therefor by any increase
in the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.

(c)      Lender shall promptly notify Borrowers of any event of which
it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a different Applicable
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to it. In the event that Lender claims compensation under this
Section, Lender shall furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, Lender
shall act in good faith and may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
methods.

Section 2.9       Limitation on Types of Loans. If on or prior to the
first day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan:

(a)      Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, as the case
may be, for such Interest Period; or

(b)      Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to Lender of funding Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period;

then Lender shall give Borrowers prompt notice thereof specifying the relevant
amounts or periods, and so long as such condition remains in effect, Lender
shall be under no obligation to make additional Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans
or convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans, and each Borrower shall, on
the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding
Eurodollar Loans made to such Borrower, either prepay such Loans or convert such
Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.10      Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for Lender or its
Applicable Lending Office to make, maintain, or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder,
then Lender shall promptly notify Borrowers thereof and Lender's obligation to
make or continue Eurodollar Loans and to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar
Loans shall be suspended until such time as Lender may again make, maintain, and
fund Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 1.4 shall be
applicable).


23
<PAGE>

Section 2.11      Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation of
Lender to make a particular Type of Loan or to continue, or to convert Loans of
any other Type into, Loans of a particular Type shall be suspended pursuant to
Sections 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10 hereof (Loans of such Type being herein called
"Affected Loans" and such Type being herein called the "Affected Type"),
Lender's Affected Loans shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on
the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for Affected Loans (or,
in the case of a Conversion required by Section 2.6 hereof, on such earlier date
as Lender may specify to Borrowers) and, unless and until Lender gives notice as
provided below that the circumstances specified in Sections 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10
hereof that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

(a)      to the extent that Lender's Affected Loans have been
so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would
otherwise be applied to Lender's Affected Loans shall be applied
instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

(b)      all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued
by Lender as Loans of the Affected Type shall be made or continued
instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Loans of Lender that would
otherwise be converted into Loans of the Affected Type shall be
converted instead into (or shall remain as) Base Rate Loans.

Section 2.12      Compensation. Upon the request of Lender, each
Borrower shall pay to Lender such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in
the reasonable opinion of Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or
expense (including loss of anticipated profits) incurred by it as a result of:

(a)      any payment, prepayment, or Conversion of a
Eurodollar Loan made to such Borrower for any reason (including,
without limitation, the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section
7.2) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Loan; or

(b)      any failure by such Borrower for any reason
(including, without limitation, the failure of any condition precedent
specified in Article IV hereof to be satisfied) to borrow, convert,
continue, or prepay a Eurodollar Loan on the date for such borrowing,
Conversion, Continuation, or prepayment specified in the relevant
notice of borrowing, prepayment, Continuation, or Conversion under this
Agreement.

Section 2.13      Taxes.

(a)      Any and all payments by Borrowers to or for the account of
Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear
of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding, taxes imposed on Lender's income, and franchise
taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the Laws of which Lender (or its
Applicable Lending Office) is organized or any political subdivision thereof
(all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,


24
<PAGE>

withholdings, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If a
Borrower shall be required by Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any
sum payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to Lender, (a) the
sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this section) Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (b) such Borrower shall make such deductions,
and (c) Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Law.

(b)      In addition, Borrowers agree to pay any and all present or
future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or
charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise
with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (hereinafter referred
to as "Other Taxes").

(c)      Borrowers agree to indemnify Lender for the full amount of
Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this section)
paid by Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest, and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto.

(d)      If Borrowers are required to pay additional amounts to or for
the account of Lender pursuant to this Section, then Lender will agree to use
reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office
so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter
accrue if such change, in the judgment of Lender, is not otherwise
disadvantageous to Lender and in the event Lender is reimbursed for an amount
paid by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 3.7, it shall promptly return such
amount to Borrowers.

(e)      Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of
Taxes, Borrowers shall furnish to Lender the original or a certified copy of a
receipt evidencing such payment.

(f)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of Borrowers contained in
this section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment in
full of the Notes.

properties and assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and is
or will be qualified in those states wherein it proposes to transact business in
the future and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the
extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.2       Authorization and Power. Each Related Person has the
requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents
to which it is a party; each Related Person is duly authorized to and has taken
all corporate action necessary to authorize it to, execute, deliver and perform
the Loan Documents to which it is a party and is and will continue to be duly

Section 4.3       No Conflicts or Consents. Neither the execution and
delivery by any Related Person of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, nor
the consummation of any of the transactions herein or therein contemplated, nor
compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or with the terms


28
<PAGE>

and provisions thereof, will (a) materially contravene or conflict with any
Requirement of Law to which any Related Person is subject, or any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement or instrument to which any Related
Person is a party or by which any Related Person may be bound, or to which the
Property of any Related Person may be subject, or (b) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien, other than the Lien of the Security Agreements, on the
Property of any Related Person. All actions, approvals, consents, waivers,
exemptions, variances, franchises, orders, permits, authorizations, rights and
licenses required to be taken, given or obtained, as the case may be, from any
Governmental Authority that are necessary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents have been obtained.

Section 4.4       Enforceable Obligations. This Agreement, the Notes,

legal, valid and binding obligations of such Related Person, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as limited by Debtor Laws.

2001. Preferred has also delivered to Lender its unaudited quarterly balance
sheet for the period ending June 30, 2002 and management reports for June 30,
2002; such management reports fairly and accurately present Borrowers'
commitment position, pipeline position, servicing and production as of the end
of such months and for the fiscal year to date for the periods ending on such
dates.

Section 4.8       Full Disclosure. There is no material fact that
Borrowers have not disclosed to Lender which could adversely affect the

Servicing Rights. To the knowledge of Borrowers, none of (i) the financial
statements referred to in Section 4.7

Related Person in any jurisdiction have been filed and all taxes, assessments,
fees and other governmental charges upon each Related Person or upon any of its
properties, income or franchises have been paid prior to the time that such
taxes could give rise to a Lien thereon, unless protested in good faith by

GAAP have been established on the books of such Related Person. No Related
Person has any knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against any Related
Person.

hereby will not alter or impair in any material respect any of such rights of
each Related Person.

Person is (a) a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding

Section 4.19      No Approvals Required. Other than consents and
approvals previously obtained and actions previously taken, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents
to which any Related Person is a party, nor the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby requires the consent or approval of,
the giving of notice to, or the registration, recording or filing by any Related
Person of any document with, or the taking of any other action in respect of,
any Governmental Authority which has jurisdiction over each Related Person or
any of its Property, except for (a) the filing of the Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements and other similar filings to perfect the interest of Lender
in the Collateral, and (b) such other consents, approvals, notices,
registrations, filings or action as may be required in the ordinary course of
business of the Related Persons in connection with the performance of the
obligations of the Related Persons hereunder.

Section 4.20      Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties by each Borrower herein shall survive delivery of the Note and the
funding of the Loans, and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of
Lender shall not diminish the right of Lender to rely thereon.

Mortgage Note and Mortgage, was the sole owner thereof and had full right to
pledge the Mortgage Loan to Lender free and clear of any other Lien;

(b)      To the knowledge of Borrowers, there is no default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration existing under any Mortgage or the related
Mortgage Note and there is no event which, with the passage of time or with
notice and/or the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a
default, breach, violation or event of acceleration and no such default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration has been waived;

(c)      To the knowledge of Borrowers, the physical condition of the
Property subject to the Mortgage has not deteriorated since the date of

Mortgaged Property;

judicial foreclosure;

(e)      Each Mortgage Loan is a first lien or second lien

that the aggregate amount of Second Lien Loans does not exceed the Second Lien
Sublimit;

(f)      Each Mortgage Note is payable in monthly installments of

of a manufactured home or mobile home or the purchase of the land on which a

date of origination thereof.

Section 4.22      Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of each
Related Person's business, the officers and managers of each Related Person
consider the effect of Environmental Laws on the business of such Related
Person, in the course of which they identify and evaluate potential risks and
liabilities accruing to such Related Person due to Environmental Laws. On the
basis of this consideration, each Related Person has reasonably concluded that

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the business or financial
condition of such Related Person or on the ability of Borrowers to perform the
Obligations. No Related Person has received any notice to the effect that its
operations are not in material compliance with any of the requirements of
applicable Environmental Laws or are the subject of any federal or state
investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a
release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment, which
non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the business or financial condition of the Related
Persons, taken as a whole, or on the ability of Borrowers to perform the
Obligations.

current value of such ERISA Plan's benefits guaranteed under Title IV of ERISA
exceeds the then current value of such ERISA Plan's assets available for the
payment of such benefits by more than $10,000 (or in the case of a Termination
Event involving the withdrawal of a substantial employer, the withdrawing
employer's proportionate share of such excess exceeds such amount) or (iii) any
Related Person or any ERISA Affiliate withdraws from a multiemployer plan

GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS. ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT AND

<PAGE>
Section 10.6      Renewal, Extension or Rearrangement. All provisions
of this Agreement and of the other Loan Documents shall apply with equal force
and effect to each and all promissory Note hereafter executed which in whole or
in part represent a renewal, extension for any period, increase or rearrangement
of any part of the Obligations originally represented by the Note or of any part
of such other Obligations.

Section 10.7      Waivers. No course of dealing on the part of Lender,
or any of its officers, employees, consultants or agents, nor any failure or
delay by Lender with respect to exercising any right, power or privilege of
Lender under the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall operate

Section 10.8      Cumulative Rights. The rights and remedies of Lender
under the Note, this Agreement, and any other Loan Document shall be cumulative,
and the exercise or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy.

Section 10.9      Limitation on Interest. Lender, each Related Person
and any other parties to the Loan Documents intend to contract in strict
compliance with applicable usury Law from time to time in effect. In furtherance
thereof such Persons stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions
contained in the Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to
pay, for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest in excess of the
maximum amount of interest permitted to be charged by applicable Law from time
to time in effect. Neither each Related Person nor any present or future
guarantors, endorsers, or other Persons hereafter becoming liable for payment of
any Obligation shall ever be liable for unearned interest thereon or shall ever
be required to pay interest thereon in excess of the maximum amount that may be
lawfully charged under applicable Law from time to time in effect, and the
provisions of this section shall control over all other provisions of the Loan
Documents which may be in conflict or apparent conflict herewith. Lender
expressly disavows any intention to charge or collect excessive unearned
interest or finance charges in the event the maturity of any Obligation is
accelerated. If (a) the maturity of any Obligation is accelerated for any
reason, (b) any Obligation is prepaid and as a result any amounts held to
constitute interest are determined to be in excess of the legal maximum, or (c)
Lender or any other holder of any or all of the Obligations shall otherwise
collect moneys which are determined to constitute interest which would otherwise
increase the interest on any or all of the Obligations to an amount in excess of
that permitted to be charged by applicable Law then in effect, then all such
sums determined to constitute interest in excess of such legal limit shall,
without penalty, be promptly applied to reduce the then outstanding principal of
the related Obligations or, at Lender's or such holder's option, promptly
returned to each Related Person or the other payor thereof upon such
determination. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under
any specific circumstance, exceeds the maximum amount permitted under applicable
Law, Lender and each Related Persons (and any other payors thereof) shall to the
greatest extent permitted under applicable Law, (i) characterize any
non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest,
(ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize,
prorate, allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the entire
contemplated


48
<PAGE>

term of the instruments evidencing the Obligations in accordance with the
amounts outstanding from time to time thereunder and the maximum legal rate of
interest from time to time in effect under applicable Law in order to lawfully
charge the maximum amount of interest permitted under applicable Law. In the
event applicable Law provides for an interest ceiling under Section 303 of the
Texas Finance Code, that ceiling shall be the weekly ceiling.

Section 10.10     Bank Accounts; Offset. To secure the repayment of the
Obligations each Related Person hereby grants to Lender and to each financial
institution which hereafter acquires a participation or other interest in the
Loans or Note (in this section called a "Participant") a security interest, a
lien, and a right of offset, each of which shall be in addition to all other
interests, liens, and rights of Lender or any Participant at common law, under
the Loan Documents, or otherwise, and each of which shall be upon and against
(a) any and all moneys, securities or other property (and the proceeds
therefrom) of any Related Person now or hereafter held or received by or in
transit to Lender, any Lender or Participant from or for the account any Related
Person, whether for safekeeping, custody pledge, transmission, collection or
otherwise, (b) any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) of any Related Person with Lender or any Participant, and
(c) any other credits and claims of any Related Person at any time existing
against Lender, any Lender or Participant, including claims under certificates
of deposit. Upon the occurrence of any Default, each of Lender and Participants
is hereby authorized to foreclose upon, offset, appropriate, and apply, at any
time and from time to time, without notice to Borrowers, any and all items
hereinabove referred to against the Obligations then due and payable.

Section 10.11     Joint and Several Liability; Parties in Interest. All
Obligations which are incurred by two or more Related Persons shall be their
joint and several obligations and liabilities. All grants, covenants and
agreements contained in the Loan Documents shall bind and inure to the benefit
of the parties thereto and their respective successors and assigns; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no Related Person may assign or transfer any of its rights or
delegate any of its duties or obligations under any Loan Document without the
prior consent of Lender.

Section 10.12     Assignments, Participations.

(a)      Assignments. Lender shall have the right to sell, assign or
transfer all or any part of Note, Loans and rights and the associated rights and
obligations under all Loan Documents to one or more financial institutions, with
minimum assets of $5,000,000,000, and the assignee, transferee or recipient
shall have, to the extent of such sale, assignment, or transfer, the same
rights, benefits and obligations of Lender. Within five (5) Business Days after
any such assignment, the assignee shall notify Borrowers of the outstanding
principal balance of the Note payable to assignee and each Borrower shall
execute and deliver to assignee a new Note evidencing such assignee's assigned
Loans made to such Borrower and, if the assignor Lender has retained a portion
of its Loans, replacement Note in the principal amount of the Loans made to such
Borrower retained by the assignor Lender (such Note to be in exchange for, but
not in payment of, the Note held by such Lender).


49
<PAGE>

(b)      Participations. Lender shall have the right to grant
participations in all or any part of the Note, Loans and the associated rights

(c)      Distribution of Information. Subject to Section 10.17, it is
understood and agreed that Lender may provide to assignees and participants and
prospective assignees and participants financial information and reports and
data concerning Borrowers' properties and operations which was provided to
Lender pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 10.13     Exhibits. The exhibits attached to this Agreement are
incorporated herein and shall be considered a part of this Agreement for the
purposes stated herein, except that in the event of any conflict between any of
the provisions of such exhibits and the provisions of this Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.

Section 10.14     Titles of Articles, Sections and Subsections. All
titles or headings to articles, sections, subsections or other divisions of this
Agreement or the exhibits hereto are only for the convenience of the parties and
shall not be construed to have any effect or meaning with respect to the other
content of such articles, sections, subsections or other divisions, such other
content being controlling as to the agreement between the parties hereto.

Section 10.15     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, and it shall not be necessary that the signatures of both of the
parties hereto be contained on any one counterpart hereof; each counterpart
shall be deemed an original, but all counterparts together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

SECTION 10.16     ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THE NOTE, THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO
AND THERETO AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR
SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL
AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.

Section 10.17     Termination; Limited Survival. In their sole and
absolute discretion Borrowers may at any time that no Obligations are owing
elect in a notice delivered to Lender to terminate this Agreement. Upon receipt
by Lender of such a notice, if no Obligations are then owing, this Agreement and
all other Loan Documents shall thereupon be terminated and the parties thereto
released from all prospective obligations thereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, any waivers or admissions made by
any Person in any Loan Documents, any Obligations, and any obligations which any
Person may have to indemnify or compensate Lender shall survive any termination
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. At the request and expense of
Borrowers, Lender shall prepare and execute all necessary instruments to reflect
and effect such termination of the Loan Documents.

Section 10.18     Confidential Information. Lender shall use any
confidential non-public information concerning the Borrowers, the Parent, and
their Subsidiaries that is furnished to Lender by or on behalf of the Borrowers,
the Parent and their Subsidiaries in connection with the Loan Documents
(collectively, "Confidential Information") solely for the purpose of evaluating
and providing products and services to them and administering and enforcing the
Loan Documents, and shall hold the Confidential Information in confidence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender may disclose Confidential Information (a)
to its Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates' directors, officers,
employees, advisors, or representatives (collectively, the "Representatives")
whom it determines need to know such information for the purposes set forth in
this Section; (b) to any bank or financial institution or other entity to which
such Lender has assigned or desires to assign an interest or participation in

recipient of such Confidential Information agrees to keep such Confidential
Information confidential as specified herein; (c) to any Governmental Authority

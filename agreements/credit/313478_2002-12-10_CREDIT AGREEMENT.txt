TERMS OF FACILITY

2.1  Revolving Line of Credit. (a) Upon the terms and conditions
(including, without limitation, the right of the Lender to decline to make any
Loan so long as any Default or Event of Default exists) and relying on the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Lender agrees,
during the Commitment Period, to make Loans, in immediately available funds at
the Principal Office, to or for the benefit of the Borrower, from time to time
on any Business Day designated by the Borrower following receipt by the Lender
of a Borrowing Request; provided, however, that the Loan Balance shall not
exceed at any time the lesser of the Commitment Amount or the Borrowing Base
then in effect. Loans shall be made from time to time on any Business Day
designated by the Borrower in its Borrowing Request.

(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, during the Commitment
Period, the Borrower may borrow, repay, and reborrow and convert Loans of one
type or with one Interest Period into Loans of another type or with a different
Interest Period. Except for prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.11, each
borrowing, conversion, and prepayment of principal of Loans shall be

16

<PAGE>

in an amount at least equal to $100,000. Each borrowing, prepayment, or
conversion of or into a Loan of a different type or, in the case of a LIBO Rate
Loan, having a different Interest Period, shall be deemed a separate borrowing,
conversion, and prepayment for purposes of the foregoing, one for each type of
Loan or Interest Period. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, the aggregate principal amount of LIBO Rate Loans having the
same Interest Period shall be at least equal to $500,000 with multiples of
$100,000; and if any LIBO Rate Loan would otherwise be in a lesser principal
amount for any period, such Loan shall be a Floating Rate Loan during such
period.

(c) The Loans made under this Section 2.1 shall be made and maintained
at the Principal Office and shall be evidenced by the Note.

2.2  Letter of Credit Facility. Upon the terms and conditions and relying
on the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Lender
agrees, from the date of this Agreement until the date which is 30 days prior to
the Commitment Termination Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of
the Borrower and to renew and extend such Letters of Credit. Letters of Credit
shall be issued, renewed, or extended from time to time on any Business Day
designated by the Borrower following the receipt in accordance with the terms
hereof by the Lender of the written (or oral, confirmed promptly in writing)
request by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower therefor and a Letter of Credit
Application. Letters of Credit shall be issued in such amounts as the Borrower
may request; provided, however, that (i) no Letter of Credit shall have an
expiration date which is more than 365 days after the issuance thereof or
subsequent to five days prior to the Commitment Termination Date, (ii) the Loan
Balance plus the L/C Exposure shall not exceed at any time the lesser of the
Commitment Amount or the Borrowing Base, and (iii) the L/C Exposure shall not
exceed at any time $1,000,000.

2.3  Limitations on Interest Periods. Each Interest Period selected by the
Borrower (a) which commences on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or
any day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the appropriate
subsequent calendar month) shall end on the last Business Day of the appropriate
subsequent calendar month, (b) which would otherwise end on a day which is not a
Business Day shall end on the next succeeding Business Day (or, if such next
succeeding Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, on the next
preceding Business Day), (c) which would otherwise end after Final Maturity
shall end on Final Maturity, and (d) shall have a duration of not less than one
month and, if any Interest Period would otherwise be a shorter period, the
relevant Loan shall be a Floating Rate Loan during such period.

2.4  Limitation on Types of Loans. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no more than six separate Loans, including LIBO Rate Loans,
shall be outstanding at any one time, with, for purposes of this Section, all
Floating Rate Loans constituting one Loan, and all LIBO Rate Loans for the same
Interest Period constituting one Loan. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any interest rate for
any LIBO Rate Loan for any Interest Period therefor:

(a) the Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error) that quotations of interest rates for the deposits
referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.2 are not being
provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for
purposes of determining the rate of interest for such Loan as provided in
this Agreement; or

17

<PAGE>

(b) the Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error) that the rates of interest referred to in the
definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.2 upon the basis of which the rate
of interest for such Loan for such Interest Period is to be determined do
not adequately cover the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining such
Loan for such Interest Period,

then the Lender shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof; and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lender shall be under no obligation to
make LIBO Rate Loans or to convert Floating Rate Loans into LIBO Rate Loans, and
the Borrower shall, on the last day of the then current Interest Period for each
outstanding LIBO Rate Loan, either prepay such LIBO Rate Loan or convert such
Loan into a Floating Rate Loan in accordance with Section 2.12.

2.5  Use of Loan Proceeds and Letters of Credit. As of the date hereof,
indebtedness in the amount of $5,069,748.71 is outstanding under the Existing
Note. The Lender shall use proceeds of the initial Loan to purchase such
indebtedness. Such indebtedness shall be renewed, extended, and rearranged
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Note, and the relevant Borrowing
Request and shall for all purposes be deemed a borrowing hereunder. Proceeds of
all subsequent Loans shall be used solely for acquisitions and development of
Oil and Gas Properties and for general corporate purposes.

(b) Letters of Credit shall be used solely for general corporate
purposes provided, however, no Letter of Credit may be used in lieu or in
support of stay or appeal bonds.

2.6  Interest. Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, Section 2.15), interest on the Loans shall accrue and be payable at
a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for each Floating Rate Loan and the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for each LIBO Rate Loan. Interest on all Floating Rate Loans
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day)
during the period for which payable. Interest on all LIBO Rate Loans shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, and actual days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day) during the period for which payable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest on past-due principal and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, past-due interest, shall accrue at the Default
Rate, computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day)
during the period for which payable, and shall be payable upon demand by the
Lender at any time as to all or any portion of such interest. In the event that
the Borrower fails to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Fixed
Rate Loan within the time period and otherwise as provided herein, such Loan (if
outstanding as a Fixed Rate Loan) will be automatically converted into a
Floating Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period for such
Loan or (if outstanding as a Floating Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not then
outstanding) will be made as, a Floating Rate Loan. Interest provided for herein
shall be calculated on unpaid sums actually advanced and outstanding pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and only for the period from the date or dates of
such advances until repayment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing each LIBO
Rate Loan shall be converted to a Floating Rate Loan on the last day of the
interest period applicable thereto.

18

<PAGE>

2.7  Repayment of Loans and Interest. Accrued and unpaid interest on each
outstanding Floating Rate Loan shall be due and payable monthly commencing on
the first day of January, 2003, and continuing on the first day of each calendar
month thereafter while any Floating Rate Loan remains outstanding, the payment
in each instance to be the amount of interest which has accrued and remains
unpaid in respect of the relevant Loan. Accrued and unpaid interest on each
outstanding LIBO Rate Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of the
Interest Period for such LIBO Rate Loan and, in the case of any Interest Period
in excess of three months, on the day of the third calendar month following the
commencement of such Interest Period corresponding to the day of the calendar
month on which such Interest Period commenced, the payment in each instance to
be the amount of interest which has accrued and remains unpaid in respect of the
relevant Loan. The Loan Balance, together with all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, shall be due and payable at Final Maturity. At the time of making each
payment hereunder or under the Note, the Borrower shall specify to the Lender
the Loans or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such
payment is to be applied. In the event the Borrower fails to so specify, or if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Lender may apply such
payment as it may elect in its sole discretion.

2.8  Outstanding Amounts. The outstanding principal balance of the Note
reflected by the notations by the Lender on its records shall be deemed
rebuttably presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing on the Note. The
liability for payment of principal and interest evidenced by the Note shall be
limited to principal amounts actually advanced and outstanding pursuant to this
Agreement and interest on such amounts calculated in accordance with this
Agreement.

2.9  Time, Place, and Method of Payments. All payments required pursuant to
this Agreement or the Note shall be made in lawful money of the United States of
America and in immediately available funds, shall be deemed received by the
Lender on the next Business Day following receipt if such receipt is after 2:00
p.m., Central Standard or Daylight Savings Time, as the case may be, on any
Business Day, and shall be made at the Principal Office. Except as provided to
the contrary herein, if the due date of any payment hereunder or under the Note
would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day, such date shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable for
any principal so extended for the period of such extension.

2.10 Borrowing Base Determinations. (a) The Borrowing Base as of the
Closing Date is acknowledged by the Borrower and the Lender to be $7,500,000.
Commencing on January 1, 2003, and continuing thereafter on the first day of
each calendar month until the next Borrowing Base review, the amount of the
Borrowing Base shall be reduced by $200,000.

(b) The Borrowing Base shall be redetermined semi-annually beginning
May 1, 2003, on the basis of information supplied by the Borrower in compliance
with the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Reserve
Reports, and all other information available to the Lender. In addition, the
Lender shall, in the normal course of business following a request of the
Borrower, redetermine the Borrowing Base; provided, however, the Lender shall
not be obligated to respond to more than two such requests during any calendar
year, and in no event shall the Lender be required to redetermine the Borrowing
Base more than once in any three-month period, including, without limitation,
each scheduled semi-annual redetermination provided for above. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Lender may at its discretion redetermine the Borrowing Base
and the amount by which the Borrowing Base shall be reduced each calendar month
as set forth in Section 2.7(a) at any time and from time to time.

19

<PAGE>

(c) Upon each determination of the Borrowing Base by the Lender, the
Lender shall notify the Borrower orally (confirming such notice promptly in
writing) of such determination, and the Borrowing Base and the amount by which
the Borrowing Base shall be reduced so communicated to the Borrower shall become
effective upon such written notification and shall remain in effect until the
next subsequent determination of the Borrowing Base and the amount by which the
Borrowing Base shall be reduced.

(d) The Borrowing Base shall represent the determination by the
Lender, in accordance with the applicable definitions and provisions herein
contained and its customary lending practices for loans of this nature, of the
value, for loan purposes, of the Mortgaged Properties, subject, in the case of
any increase in the Borrowing Base, to the credit approval process of the
Lender. Furthermore, the Borrower acknowledges that the determination of the
Borrowing Base contains an equity cushion (market value in excess of loan
value), which is acknowledged by the Borrower to be essential for the adequate
protection of the Lender.

2.11 Mandatory Prepayments. If at any time the sum of the Loan Balance and
the L/C Exposure exceeds the Borrowing Base then in effect, the Borrower shall,
within 30 days of notice from the Lender of such occurrence, (a) prepay, or make
arrangements acceptable to the Lender for the prepayment of, the amount of such
excess for application on the Loan Balance, (b) provide additional collateral,
of character and value satisfactory to the Lender in its sole discretion, to
secure the Obligations by the execution and delivery to the Lender of security
instruments in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender, or (c) effect any
combination of the alternatives described in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section
and acceptable to the Lender in its sole discretion. In the event that a
mandatory prepayment is required under this Section and the Loan Balance is less
than the amount required to be prepaid, the Borrower shall repay the entire Loan
Balance and, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Letter of Credit
Applications executed by the Borrower or otherwise to the satisfaction of the
Lender, deposit with the Lender, as additional collateral securing the
Obligations, an amount of cash, in immediately available funds, equal to the L/C
Exposure minus the Borrowing Base. The cash deposited with the Lender in
satisfaction of the requirement provided in this Section may be invested, at the
sole discretion of the Lender and then only at the express direction of the
Borrower as to investment vehicle and maturity (which shall be no later than the
latest expiry date of any then outstanding Letter of Credit), for the account of
the Borrower in cash or cash equivalent investments offered by or through the
Lender.

2.12 Voluntary Prepayments of Loans. Subject to applicable provisions of
this Agreement, the Borrower shall have the right at any time or from time to
time to prepay Loans without prepayment penalty provided, however, (a) the
Borrower shall pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the amounts prepaid, and
(b) no such prepayment shall serve to postpone the repayment when due of any
Obligation.

2.13 Commitment Fee. In addition to interest on the Note as provided herein
and all other fees payable hereunder and to compensate the Lender for
maintaining funds available, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, in
immediately available funds, on the first day of April, 2003, and on the first
day of each third calendar month thereafter during the Commitment Period, a fee
in the amount of one-half percent (1/2%) per annum, calculated on the basis of a
year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day), on the average daily amount of the

of $56,250 (one-half of which has previously been paid, leaving a balance of
$28,125 due on the Closing Date) and .75% on any future increase of the
Borrowing Base then in effect.

herein and all other fees payable hereunder and to compensate the Lender for the
costs of evaluating the Mortgaged Properties and reviewing the Reserve Reports,
the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, in immediately available funds, on the
date of each redetermination of the Borrowing Base, an engineering fee in the
amount of $5,000.00.

2.16 Letter of Credit Fee. In addition to interest on the Note as provided
herein and Commitment Fees and Facility Fees payable hereunder, the Borrower
agrees to pay to the Lender on the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit, a
fee equal to the greater of $500 or 2.75% per annum, calculated on the basis of
a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day), on the face amount of such
Letter of Credit during the period for which such Letter of Credit is issued;
provided, however, in the event such Letter of Credit is canceled prior to its
original expiry date or a payment is made by the Lender with respect to such
Letter of Credit, the Lender shall, within ten days after such cancellation or
the making of such payment, rebate to the Borrower the unearned portion of such
fee. The Borrower also agrees to pay to the Lender on demand its customary
letter of credit transactional fees, including, without limitation, amendment
fees, payable with respect to each Letter of Credit. Upon the Borrower's
request, a schedule of fees will be provided which fees are subject to change.

not be obligated to, make Loans for the benefit of the Borrower and apply
proceeds thereof to the extent reasonably required to satisfy of any condition,
warranty, representation, or covenant of the Borrower contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document. Any such Loan shall be evidenced by the
Note and shall be made at the Floating Rate.

2.18 Security Interest in Accounts; Right of Offset. As security for the
payment and performance of the Obligations, the Borrower hereby transfers,
assigns, and pledges to the Lender and grants to the Lender a security interest
in all funds of the Borrower now or hereafter or from time to time on deposit
with the Lender, with such interest of the Lender to be retransferred,
reassigned, and/or released by the Lender, as the case may be, at the expense of
the Borrower upon payment in full and complete performance by the Borrower of
all Obligations. All remedies as secured party or assignee of such funds shall
be exercisable by the Lender upon the occurrence of any Event of Default,
regardless of whether the exercise of any such remedy would result in any
penalty or loss of interest or profit with respect to any withdrawal of funds
deposited in a time deposit account prior to the maturity thereof. Furthermore,
the Borrower hereby grants to the Lender the right, exercisable at such time as
any Obligation shall mature, whether by acceleration of maturity or otherwise,
of offset or banker's lien against all funds of the Borrower now or hereafter or
from time to time on deposit with the Lender, regardless of whether the exercise
of any such remedy would result in any penalty or loss of interest or profit
with respect to any withdrawal of funds deposited in a time deposit account
prior to the maturity thereof.

2.19 General Provisions Relating to Interest. (a) It is the intention of
the parties hereto to comply strictly with the usury laws of the State of Texas
and the United States of America. In this connection, there shall never be
collected, charged, or received on the sums advanced hereunder interest in
excess of that which would accrue at the Highest Lawful Rate. For purposes of
Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code (Vernon's 1999), the Borrower agrees that
the Highest Lawful Rate shall be the "weekly ceiling" as defined in such
Section, provided that the Lender may also rely, to the extent permitted by
applicable laws of the State of Texas or the United States of America, on
alternative maximum rates of interest under other laws of the State of Texas or
the United States of America applicable to the Lender, if greater.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Note to the contrary,
during any Limitation Period, the interest rate to be charged on amounts
evidenced by the Note shall be the Highest Lawful Rate, and the obligation, if
any, of the Borrower for the payment of fees or other charges deemed to be
interest under applicable law shall be suspended. During any period or periods
of time following a Limitation Period, to the extent permitted by applicable
laws of the State of Texas or the United States of America, the interest rate to
be charged hereunder shall remain at the Highest Lawful Rate until such time as
there has been paid to the Lender (i) the amount of interest in excess of that
accruing at the Highest Lawful Rate that the Lender would have received during
the Limitation Period had the interest rate remained at the otherwise applicable
rate, and (ii) all interest and fees otherwise payable to the Lender but for the
effect of such Limitation Period.

(c) If, under any circumstances, the aggregate amounts paid on the
Note or under this Agreement or any other Loan Document include amounts which by
law are deemed interest and which would exceed the amount permitted if the
Highest Lawful Rate were in effect, the Borrower stipulates that such payment
and collection will have been and will be deemed to have been, to the extent
permitted by applicable laws of the State of Texas or the United States of
America, the result of mathematical error on the part of the Borrower and the
Lender; and the Lender shall promptly refund the amount of such excess (to the
extent only of such interest payments in excess of that which would have accrued
and been payable on the basis of the Highest Lawful Rate) upon discovery of such
error by the Lender or notice thereof from the Borrower. In the event that the
maturity of any Obligation is accelerated, by reason of an election by the
Lender or otherwise, or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment,
then the consideration constituting interest under applicable laws may never
exceed the Highest Lawful Rate; and excess amounts paid which by law are deemed
interest, if any, shall be credited by the Lender on the principal amount of the
Obligations, or if the principal amount of the Obligations shall have been paid
in full, refunded to the Borrower.

(d) All sums paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Lender for the use,
forbearance and detention of the proceeds of any advance hereunder shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and
spread throughout the full term hereof until paid in full so that the actual
rate of interest is uniform but does not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate
throughout the full term hereof.

2.20 Yield Protection. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender such amounts as
shall be sufficient in the reasonable opinion of the Lender to compensate it for
any loss, cost, or expense incurred by and as a result of:

22

<PAGE>

(i)  any payment, prepayment, or conversion by the Borrower of a
Fixed Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period for such Loan; or

(ii) any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Fixed Rate Loan from
the Lender on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant
Borrowing Request;

such compensation to include, without limitation, with respect to any LIBO Rate
Loan, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest which
would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, converted, or not
borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, conversion,
or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current Interest Period for
such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such
Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to borrow) at the
applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein over (B) the
interest component (as reasonably determined by the Lender) of the amount (as
reasonably determined by the Lender) the Lender would have bid in the London
interbank market for Dollar deposits of amounts comparable to such principal
amount and maturities comparable to such period.

2.21 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
the event that it becomes unlawful for the Lender or its Applicable Lending
Office to (a) honor its obligation to make any type of Fixed Rate Loans
hereunder, or (b) maintain any type of Fixed Rate Loans hereunder, then the
Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof; and the obligation of the
Lender hereunder to make such type of Fixed Rate Loans and to convert other
types of Loans into Fixed Rate Loans of such type shall be suspended until such
time as the Lender may again make and maintain Fixed Rate Loans of such type,
and the outstanding Fixed Rate Loans of such type shall be converted into
Floating Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.13. Before giving such notice
pursuant to this Section, the Lender will designate a different available
Applicable Lending Office for Fixed Rate Loans or take such other action as the
Borrower may request if such designation or action will avoid the need to
suspend the obligation of the Lender to make Fixed Rate Loans and will not, in
the opinion of the Lender, be disadvantageous to the Lender.

2.22 Regulatory Change. In the event that by reason of any Regulatory
Change, the Lender (a) incur Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess
above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other
liabilities of the Lender which includes deposits by reference to which the
interest rate on any Fixed Rate Loan is determined as provided in this Agreement
or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender which
includes any Fixed Rate Loan, or (b) becomes subject to restrictions on the
amount of such a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, at
the election of the Lender with notice to the Borrower, the obligation of the
Lender to make such Fixed Rate Loans and to convert Floating Rate Loans into
such Fixed Rate Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Regulatory
Change ceases to be in effect, and all such outstanding Fixed Rate Loans shall
be converted into Floating Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.13.

2.23 Limitations on Interest Periods. Each Interest Period selected by the
Borrower (a) which commences on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or,
with respect to any LIBO Rate Loan, any day for which there is no numerically
corresponding day in the appropriate subsequent

23

<PAGE>

calendar month) shall end on the last Business Day of the appropriate subsequent
calendar month, (b) which would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business
Day shall end on the next succeeding Business Day (or, if such next succeeding
Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, on the next preceding
Business Day), (c) which would otherwise commence before and end after Final
Maturity shall end on Final Maturity, and (d) shall have a duration of not less
than one month, as to any LIBO Rate Loan, and, if any Interest Period would
otherwise be a shorter period, the relevant Loan shall be a Floating Rate Loan
during such period.

2.24 Letters in Lieu of Transfer Orders. The Lender agrees that none of the
letters in lieu of transfer or division orders provided by the Borrower pursuant
to Section 3.1(g)(v) or Section 5.7 will be sent to the addressees thereof prior
to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, at which time the
Lender may, at its option and in addition to the exercise of any of its other
rights and remedies, send any or all of such letters.

2.25 Power of Attorney. The Borrower hereby designates the Lender as its
agent and attorney-in-fact, to act in its name, place, and stead for the purpose
of completing and, upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default,
delivering any and all of the letters in lieu of transfer orders delivered by
the Borrower to the Lender pursuant to Section 3.1(g)(v) or Section 5.7,
including, without limitation, completing any blanks contained in such letters
and attaching exhibits thereto describing the relevant Collateral. The Borrower
hereby ratifies and confirms all that the Lender shall lawfully do or cause to
be done by virtue of this power of attorney and the rights granted with respect
to such power of attorney. This power of attorney is coupled with the interests
of the Lender in the Collateral, shall commence and be in full force and effect
as of the Closing Date and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
irrevocable so long as any Obligation remains outstanding or unpaid or any
Commitment exists. The powers conferred on the Lender by this appointment are
solely to protect the interests of the Lender under the Loan Documents and shall
not impose any duty upon the Lender to exercise any such powers. The Lender
shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of
the exercise of such powers and shall not be responsible to the Borrower or any
other Person for any act or failure to act with respect to such powers, except
for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Lender to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and
issue Letters of Credit, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender
(which representations and warranties shall survive the delivery of the Note)
that:

4.1 Due Authorization. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of this
Agreement and the borrowings hereunder, the execution and delivery by the
Borrower of the Note, the repayment of the Note and interest and fees provided
for in the Note and this Agreement, the execution and delivery of the Security
Instruments by the Borrower and the performance of all obligations of the
Borrower under the Loan Documents are within the power of the Borrower, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by the Borrower, and do
not and will not (a) require the consent of any Governmental Authority, (b)
contravene or conflict with any Requirement of Law, (c) contravene or conflict
with any indenture, instrument, or other agreement to which the Borrower is a
party or by which any Property of the Borrower may be presently bound or
encumbered, or (d) result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
in, upon or of any Property of the Borrower under any such indenture,
instrument, or other agreement, other than the Loan Documents.

4.2 Corporate Existence. The Borrower is a corporation duly organized,
legally existing under the laws of its state of formation and is duly qualified
as a foreign corporation and in good standing in all jurisdictions wherein the
ownership of Property or the operation of its business necessitates same, other
than those jurisdictions wherein the failure to so qualify will not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

4.3 Valid and Binding Obligations. All Loan Documents to which the Borrower
is a party, when duly executed and delivered by the Borrower, will be the legal,
valid, and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower
in accordance with their respective terms.

4.4 Security Instruments. The provisions of each Security Instrument
executed by the Borrower are effective to create in favor of the Lender, a
legal, valid, and enforceable Lien in all right, title, and interest of the
Borrower in the Collateral described therein, which Liens, assuming the
accomplishment of recording and filing in accordance with applicable laws prior
to the intervention of rights of other Persons, shall constitute fully perfected
first-priority Liens on all right, title, and interest of the Borrower in the
Collateral described therein.

4.5 Title to Assets. The Borrower has good and defensible title to its Oil
and Gas Properties, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens.

4.6 Scope and Accuracy of Financial Statements. The Financial Statements of
the Borrower as of September 30, 2002, and Guarantor as of September 30, 2002,
present fairly the financial position and results of operations and cash flows
of the Borrower and Guarantor as at the relevant point in time or for the period
indicated, as applicable. No event or circumstance has

28

<PAGE>

occurred since September 30, 2002, which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

4.7 No Material Misstatements. No information, exhibit, statement, or
report furnished to the Lender by or at the direction of the Borrower or the
Guarantor in connection with this Agreement contains any material misstatement
of fact or omits to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the
statements contained therein not misleading as of the date made or deemed made.

4.8 Liabilities, Litigation, and Restrictions. Other than as listed under
the heading "Liabilities" on Exhibit V attached hereto, the Borrower has no
liabilities, direct, or contingent, which may materially and adversely affect
its business or operations or its ownership of the Collateral. Except as set
forth under the heading "Litigation" on Exhibit V hereto, no litigation or other
action of any nature affecting the Borrower is pending before any Governmental
Authority or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or
affecting the Borrower which might reasonably be expected to result in any
impairment of its ownership of any Collateral or have a Material Adverse Effect.
To the best knowledge of the Borrower, after due inquiry, no unusual or unduly
burdensome restriction, restraint or hazard exists by contract, Requirement of
Law, or otherwise relative to the business or operations of the Borrower or the
ownership and operation of the Collateral other than such as relate generally to
Persons engaged in business activities similar to those conducted by the
Borrower.

4.9 Authorizations; Consents. Except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, no authorization, consent, approval, exemption, franchise, permit, or
license of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is
required to authorize or is otherwise required in connection with the valid
execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents or any instrument
contemplated hereby, the repayment by the Borrower of the Note and interest and
fees provided in the Note and this Agreement, or the performance by the Borrower
of the Obligations.

4.10 Compliance with Laws. The Borrower and its Property, including,
without limitation, the Mortgaged Property, are in compliance with all
applicable Requirements of Law, including, without limitation, Environmental
Laws, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended, and ERISA, except to the
extent non-compliance with any such Requirements of Law could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.11 ERISA. No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Single
Employer Plan, and each Single Employer Plan has complied with and been
administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable provisions
of ERISA and the Code. To the best knowledge of the Borrower, (a) no Reportable
Event has occurred with respect to any Multiemployer Plan, and (b) each
Multiemployer Plan has complied with and been administered in all material
respects with applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. The present value of
all benefits vested under each Single Employer Plan maintained by the Borrower
or any Commonly Controlled Entity (based on the assumptions used to fund such
Plan) did not, as of the last annual valuation date applicable thereto, exceed
the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such vested benefits. Neither
the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial
withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan for which there is any withdrawal
liability. As of the most recent valuation date applicable to any Multiemployer
Plan, neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become
subject to any liability under ERISA if the Borrower or such Commonly Controlled

29

<PAGE>

Entity were to withdraw completely from such Multiemployer Plan. Neither the
Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has received notice that any
Multiemployer Plan is Insolvent or in Reorganization. To the knowledge of the
Borrower, no such Insolvency or Reorganization is reasonably likely to occur.
Based upon GAAP existing as of the date of this Agreement and current factual
circumstances, the Borrower has no reason to believe that the annual cost during
the term of this Agreement to the Borrower and all Commonly Controlled Entities
for post-retirement benefits to be provided to the current and former employees
of the Borrower and all Commonly Controlled Entities under Plans which are
welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) will, in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.12 Environmental Laws. To the best knowledge and belief of the Borrower,
except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or as described on Exhibit V
under the heading "Environmental Matters:"

(a) no Property of the Borrower is currently on or has ever been on
any Property which is on or has ever been on, any federal or state list of
Superfund Sites;

(b) no Hazardous Substances have been generated, transported, and/or
disposed of by the Borrower at a site which was, at the time of such
generation, transportation, and/or disposal, or has since become, a
Superfund Site;

(c) except in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law or the
terms of a valid permit, license, certificate, or approval of the relevant
Governmental Authority, no Release of Hazardous Substances by the Borrower
or from, affecting, or related to any Property of the Borrower or adjacent
to any Property of the Borrower has occurred; and

(d) no Environmental Complaint has been received by the Borrower.

4.13 Compliance with Federal Reserve Regulations. No transaction
contemplated by the Loan Documents is in violation of any regulations
promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, including,
without limitation, Regulations T, U, or X.

4.14 Investment Company Act Compliance. The Borrower is not, nor is the
Borrower directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of any Person
which is, an "investment company" or an "affiliated person" of an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

4.15 Public Utility Holding Company Act Compliance. The Borrower is not a
"holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

4.16 Proper Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes Due. The Borrower has
duly and properly filed its United States income tax return and all other tax
returns which are required to be filed and has paid all taxes due except such as
are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate provisions and
disclosures have been made. The respective charges and reserves on the books of
the Borrower with respect to taxes and other governmental charges are adequate.

30

<PAGE>

4.17 Refunds. Except as described on Exhibit V under the heading "Refunds,"
no orders of, proceedings pending before, or other requirements of, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, the Texas Railroad Commission, or any Governmental
Authority exist which could result in the Borrower being required to refund any
material portion of the proceeds received or to be received from the sale of
hydrocarbons constituting part of the Mortgaged Property.

4.18 Gas Contracts. Except as described on Exhibit V under the heading "Gas
Contracts," the Borrower (a) is not obligated in any material respect by virtue
of any prepayment made under any contract containing a "take-or-pay" or
"prepayment" provision or under any similar agreement to deliver hydrocarbons
produced from or allocated to any of the Mortgaged Property at some future date
without receiving full payment therefor within 90 days of delivery, and (b) has
not produced gas, in any material amount, subject to, and neither the Borrower
nor any of the Mortgaged Properties is subject to, balancing rights of third
parties or subject to balancing duties under governmental requirements, except
as to such matters for which the Borrower has established monetary reserves
adequate in amount to satisfy such obligations and has segregated such reserves
from other accounts.

4.19 Intellectual Property. The Borrower owns or is licensed to use all
Intellectual Property necessary to conduct all business material to its
condition (financial or otherwise), business, or operations as such business is
currently conducted. No claim has been asserted or is pending by any Person with
the respect to the use of any such Intellectual Property or challenging or
questioning the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property; and
the Borrower knows of no valid basis for any such claim. The use of such
Intellectual Property by the Borrower does not infringe on the rights of any
Person, except for such claims and infringements as do not, in the aggregate,
give rise to any material liability on the part of the Borrower.

4.20 Casualties or Taking of Property. Except as disclosed on Exhibit V
under the heading "Casualties," since September 30, 2002, neither the business
nor any Property of the Borrower has been materially adversely affected as a
result of any fire, explosion, earthquake, flood, drought, windstorm, accident,
strike or other labor disturbance, embargo, requisition or taking of Property,
or cancellation of contracts, permits, or concessions by any Governmental
Authority, riot, activities of armed forces, or acts of God.

4.21 Locations of Borrower. The principal place of business and chief
executive office of the Borrower is located at the address of the Borrower set
forth in Section 8.3 or at such other location as the Borrower may have, by
proper written notice hereunder, advised the Lender, provided that such other
location is within a state in which appropriate financing statements from the
Borrower in favor of the Lender have been filed.

4.22 Subsidiaries. The Borrower has no Subsidiaries except those described
on Exhibit V under the heading "Subsidiaries".

4.23 Existing Indebtedness; No Defenses. As of the date hereof, (a) the
Borrower is indebted to the Existing Lender under the Existing Note in the
aggregate principal amount of $5,069,748.71, and (b) the Borrower has no
defenses to, rights of setoff against, claims or counterclaims with respect to,
and no default exists under or with respect to, any of the Existing Loan
Documents or any Indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower to the Existing
Lender.

Any party may, by proper written notice hereunder to the others, change
the individuals or addresses to which such notices to it shall thereafter be
sent.

8.4 Parties in Interest. All covenants and agreements herein contained
by or on behalf of the Borrower or the Lender shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Borrower or the Lender, as the case may be, and their
respective legal representatives, successors, and assigns.

8.5 Rights of Third Parties. All provisions herein are imposed solely
and exclusively for the benefit of the Lender, the Borrower and the Guarantor.
No other Person shall have any right, benefit, priority, or interest hereunder
or as a result hereof or have standing to require satisfaction of provisions
hereof in accordance with their terms, and any or all of such provisions may be
freely waived in whole or in part by the Lender at any time if in its sole
discretion it deems it advisable to do so.

8.6 Renewals; Extensions. All provisions of this Agreement relating to

<PAGE>

8.7  No Waiver; Rights Cumulative. No course of dealing on the part of
the Lender, its officers or employees, nor any failure or delay by the Lender
with respect to exercising any of its rights under any Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof. The rights of the Lender under the Loan Documents
shall be cumulative and the exercise or partial exercise of any such right shall
not preclude the exercise of any other right. Neither the making of any Loan nor
the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall constitute a waiver of any of the
covenants, warranties, or conditions of the Borrower contained herein. In the
event the Borrower is unable to satisfy any such covenant, warranty, or
condition, neither the making of any Loan nor the issuance of a Letter of Credit
shall have the effect of precluding the Lender from thereafter declaring such
inability to be an Event of Default as hereinabove provided.

8.8  Survival Upon Unenforceability. In the event any one or more of
the provisions contained in any of the Loan Documents or in any other instrument
referred to herein or executed in connection with the Obligations shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
of any Loan Document or of any other instrument referred to herein or executed
in connection with such Obligations.

8.9  Amendments; Waivers. Neither this Agreement nor any provision
hereof may be amended, waived, discharged, or terminated orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the
amendment, waiver, discharge, or termination is sought.

8.10 Controlling Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control.

8.11 Disposition of Collateral. Notwithstanding any term or provision,
express or implied, in any of the Security Instruments, the realization,
liquidation, foreclosure, or any other disposition on or of any or all of the
Collateral shall be in the order and manner and determined in the sole
discretion of the Lender; provided, however, that in no event shall the Lender
violate applicable law or exercise rights and remedies other than those provided
in such Security Instruments or otherwise existing at law or in equity.

8.12 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE NOTE AND THE GUARANTY SHALL
BE DEEMED TO BE CONTRACTS MADE UNDER AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
PRINCIPLES THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICTS OF LAW; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT CHAPTER
345 OF THE TEXAS FINANCE CODE (WHICH REGULATES CERTAIN REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN
ACCOUNTS AND REVOLVING TRIPARTY ACCOUNTS) SHALL NOT APPLY.

8.13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE. ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT
TO, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH, OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR
FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE LITIGATED, AT THE SOLE
DISCRETION AND ELECTION OF THE LENDER, IN COURTS HAVING SITUS IN HOUSTON, HARRIS
COUNTY, TEXAS. THE BORROWER HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY LOCAL,

44

<PAGE>

STATE, OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN HOUSTON, HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS, AND HEREBY
WAIVES ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO TRANSFER OR CHANGE THE JURISDICTION OR VENUE OF
ANY LITIGATION BROUGHT AGAINST IT BY THE LENDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION.

8.14 WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, GUARANTOR AND THE
LENDER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY, AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT,
PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM, OR OTHER LITIGATION THAT RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF
ANY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THE
LENDER IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THE TERMS OR PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT THERETO. THE PROVISIONS OF
THIS SECTION ARE A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE LENDER ENTERING INTO THIS
AGREEMENT.

8.15 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT AMENDS, RESTATES, AND REPLACES
THE EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
PARTIES HERETO WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT HEREOF AND SHALL SUPERSEDE ANY PRIOR
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, RELATING TO THE
SUBJECT HEREOF, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND
THE DISCUSSION TERM SHEET DATED JUNE 19, 2002, FROM THE LENDER TO THE BORROWER.
FURTHERMORE, IN THIS REGARD, THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER WRITTEN LOAN DOCUMENTS
REPRESENT, COLLECTIVELY, THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES THERETO AND MAY
NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL
AGREEMENTS OF SUCH PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG SUCH
PARTIES.

8.16 Counterparts. For the convenience of the parties, this Agreement
may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which for all purposes shall
be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute
but one and the same Agreement.

8.17 Release by Borrower. Notwithstanding the assignment made and
evidenced by the Assignment and the assumption by the Lender of certain
obligations and liabilities of the Existing Lender pursuant thereto, the
Borrower hereby releases and discharges the Lender from all obligations, claims,
losses, causes of action, and liabilities, of whatsoever kind or nature, whether
heretofore or hereafter accruing, whether now known or unknown, arising under or
in connection with any Existing Loan Document or any act or omission by the
Existing Lender under or in connection with any Existing Loan Document;
provided, however, nothing set forth in this Section shall relieve the Lender
from its obligations and liabilities under the Loan Documents (other than the
Assignment) to which it is a party.

[FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL]

______________, 2002

GUARANTY BANK, FSB
333 Clay Street, Suite 4400
Houston, Texas 77002
Attention: Michael J. Ansolabehere

Re:   Credit Agreement dated as of December 6, 2002, by and between Harken
Exploration Company, XPLOR Energy,Inc., Harken Energy West Texas,
Inc., South Coast Exploration Co., XPLOR Energy SPV-1, Inc., and
Harken Gulf Exploration Company and Guaranty Bank, FSB (as amended,
restated, or supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to Harken Exploration Company, XPLOR Energy, Inc.,
Harken Energy West Texas, Inc., South Coast Exploration Co., XPLOR Energy SPV-1,
Inc., and Harken Gulf Exploration Company, and (collectively the "Borrower") and
Harken Energy Corporation (the "Guarantor") in connection with the transactions
contemplated in the Credit Agreement. This Opinion is delivered pursuant to
Section 3.1(m) of the Credit Agreement, and the Lender is hereby authorized to
rely upon this Opinion in connection with the transactions contemplated in the
Credit Agreement. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in the Credit Agreement.

In our representation of the Borrower and the Guarantor, we have examined
an executed counterpart of each of the following (the "Loan Documents"):

(a) the Credit Agreement;

(b) the Note;

(c) the Guaranty;

(d) Mortgage, Deed of Trust, Indenture, Security Agreement,
Assignment of Production, and Financing Statement dated of even date
herewith from the Borrower in favor of the Lender (the "Mortgage"); and

(e) Financing Statements from the Borrower, as debtor[s], constituent
to the Mortgage (the Financing Statement").

We have also examined the originals, or copies certified to our
satisfaction, of such other records of the Borrower and the Guarantor,
certificates of public officials and officers of the Borrower and the Guarantor,
agreements, instruments, and documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis
for the opinions hereinafter expressed.

IV-i

<PAGE>

In making such examinations, we have, with your permission, assumed:

(a) the genuineness of all signatures to the Loan Documents other
than those of the Borrower and the Guarantor;

(b) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals
and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as
copies;

(c) the Lender is authorized and has the power to enter into and
perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement;

(d) the due authorization, execution, and delivery of all Loan
Documents by each party thereto other than the Borrower and the Guarantor;
and

(e) the Borrower has title to all Property covered or affected by the
Mortgage.

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth
herein, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Borrower and the Guarantor are corporations duly organized,
legally existing, and in good standing under the laws of their respective
states of incorporation and are duly qualified as foreign corporations and
are in good standing in all jurisdictions wherein the ownership of their
respective Property or the operation of their respective businesses
necessitates same.

2. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement
and the borrowings thereunder, the execution and delivery by the Borrower
of the other Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party, and the
payment and performance of all Obligations of the Borrower thereunder are
within the power of the Borrower, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and do not (a) require the consent of any
Governmental Authority, (b) contravene or conflict with any Requirement of
Law, (c) to our knowledge after due inquiry, contravene or conflict with
any indenture, instrument, or other agreement to which the Borrower is a
party or by which any Property of the Borrower may be presently bound or
encumbered, or (d) result in or require the creation or imposition of any
Lien upon any Property of the Borrower other than as contemplated by the
Loan Documents.

3. The execution and delivery of the Guaranty and the other Loan
Documents executed by the Guarantor and the performance of all Obligations
of the Guarantor thereunder are within the power of the Guarantor, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not (a)
require the consent of any Governmental Authority, (b) contravene or
conflict with any Requirement of Law, (c) to our knowledge after due
inquiry, contravene or conflict with any indenture, instrument, or other
agreement to which the Guarantor is a party or by which any Property of
the Guarantor may be presently bound or encumbered, or (d) result in or
require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any Property of the
Guarantor other than as contemplated by the Loan Documents.

IV-ii

<PAGE>

4.  The Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party
constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Borrower,
enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective
terms.

5.  The Loan Documents to which the Guarantor is a party
constitute legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Guarantor,
enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with their respective
terms.

6.  The forms of the Mortgage and the Financing Statement and
the description of the Mortgaged Property (as such term is defined in
the Mortgage and so used herein) situated in the State of Texas (the
"State") satisfy all applicable Requirements of Law of the State and
are legally sufficient under the laws of the State to enable the
Lender to realize the practical benefits purported to be afforded by
the Mortgage.

7.  The Mortgage creates a valid lien upon and security
interest in all Mortgaged Property situated in the State to secure
the Indebtedness (as such term is defined in the Mortgage and so used
herein).

8.  The Mortgage and the Financing Statement are in
satisfactory form for filing and recording in the offices described
below.

9.  The filing and/or recording, as the case may be, of (a)
the Mortgage in the office of the county clerk of each county in the
State in which any portion of the Mortgaged Property is located, and
as a financing statement and utility security instrument in the
office of the Secretary of State of the State, and (b) the Financing
Statement in the Uniform Commercial Code records in each county in
the State in which any portion of the Mortgaged Property is located
are the only recordings or filings in the State necessary to perfect
the liens and security interests in the Mortgaged Property created by
the Mortgage or to permit the Lender to enforce in the State its
rights under the Mortgage. No subsequent filing, re-filing,
recording, or re-recording will be required in the State in order to
continue the perfection of the liens and security interests created
by the Mortgage except that (a) a continuation statement must be
filed with respect to the Mortgage filed as a financing statement in
the office of the Secretary of State of the State and with respect to
the Financing Statement in the Uniform Commercial Code records in
each county in the State in which any portion of the Mortgaged
Property is located, each within six months prior to the expiration
of five years from the date of the relevant initial financing
statement filing, (b) a subsequent continuation statement must be
filed within six months prior to the expiration of each subsequent
five-year period from the date of each initial financing statement
filing, and (c) amendments or supplements to the Mortgage filed as a
financing statement and the Financing Statement and/or additional
financing statements may be required to be filed in the event of a
change in the name, identity, or structure of the Borrower or in the
event the financing statement filing otherwise becomes inaccurate or
incomplete.

10. To our knowledge after due inquiry, except as disclosed
in Exhibit V to the Credit Agreement, no litigation or other action
of any nature affecting the Borrower or the Guarantor is pending
before any Governmental Authority or threatened against the Borrower
or the Guarantor.

IV-iii

<PAGE>

11. No authorization, consent, approval, exemption, franchise, permit
or license of, or filing (other than filing of Security Instruments in
appropriate filing offices) with, any Governmental Authority or any other
Person is required to authorize or is otherwise required in connection
with the valid execution and delivery by the Borrower and the Guarantor of
the Loan Documents or any instrument contemplated thereby, or the payment
performance by the Borrower and the Guarantor of the Obligations.

12. No transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents is in violation
of any regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, including, without limitation, Regulations G, T, U, or X.

13. The Borrower is not, nor is the Borrower directly or indirectly
controlled by or acting on behalf of any Person which is, an "investment
company" or an "affiliated person" of an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

14. The Borrower is not a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a
"holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company,"
within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended.

The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following qualifications
and limitations:

A. We are licensed to practice law only in the State and other
jurisdictions whose laws are not applicable to the opinions expressed
herein; accordingly, the foregoing opinions are limited solely to the laws
of the State, applicable United States federal law, and the corporation
laws of the State of Delaware.

B. The validity, binding effect, and enforceability of the Loan
Documents may be limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, or other similar laws affecting rights of
creditors generally, including, without limitation, statutes or rules of
law which limit the effect of waivers of rights by a debtor or grantor;
provided, however, that the limitations and other effects of such statutes
or rules of law upon the validity and binding effect of the Loan Documents
should not differ materially from the limitations and other effects of
such statutes or rules of law upon the validity and binding effect of
credit agreements, promissory notes, guaranty, and security instruments
generally.

C. The enforceability of the respective obligations of the Borrower
and the Guarantor under the Loan Documents is subject to general
principles of equity (whether such enforceability is considered in a suit
in equity or at law).

This Opinion is furnished by us solely for the benefit of the Lender
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and is
not to be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise referred to or disclosed in
any other transaction.

Very truly yours,

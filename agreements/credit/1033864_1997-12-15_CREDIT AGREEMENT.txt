Loan, at the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time) minus one-quarter

been released pursuant to Section 2.14., then such Loan shall bear
interest at the Base Rate (as in effect from time to time); and

(ii) during the periods that such Facility B Loan is a LIBOR Loan,
for each Interest Period relating thereto, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for
such Facility B Loan for such Interest Period plus two percent (2.0%);

Business Day of each calendar month; (ii) in the case of a LIBOR Loan, on the
last day of each Interest Period thereof (and, if such Interest Period is
longer than three months, at three-month intervals following the first day of
such Interest Period); (iii) in the case of each Loan, upon the payment or
prepayment thereof or the Conversion of such Loan to a Loan of another Type

Section 2.4.(a) or (b), as applicable.

(e)  In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans
exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable Law and, in the event
any such payment is paid by the Company or received by the Lender, then such
excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Company
shall notify the Lender in writing that the Company elects to have such excess
sum returned to it forthwith.  It is the express intent of the parties hereto
that the Company not pay and the Lender not receive, directly or indirectly, in
any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid by
the Company under Applicable Law.

(f)  THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY AGREE AND STIPULATE THAT THE ONLY CHARGE

The Company shall have the right to terminate or reduce the amount of
either the Facility A Commitment or the Facility B Commitment at any time or
from time to time; provided that: (i) the Company shall give notice of each
such termination or reduction as provided in Section 3.3., which notice when
given shall be irrevocable and (ii) each partial reduction shall be in an
aggregate amount at least equal to $100,000 or an integral multiple of $100,000
in excess thereof.   The Facility A Commitment and the Facility B Commitment,

2.6.   CONTINUATION AND CONVERSION OF LOANS

(a)  So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Company may on any Business Day, with respect to any LIBOR
Loan, elect to maintain such LIBOR Loan or any portion thereof as a LIBOR Loan
by selecting a new Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan or portion.  Each new
Interest Period selected under this Section shall commence on the last day of
the immediately preceding Interest Period.  Each selection of a new Interest
Period shall be made by the Company's giving of a notice in the form of Exhibit

notice by the Company of a Continuation shall specify (a) the effective date of
such Continuation, (b) the LIBOR Loan and portion thereof subject to such
Continuation and (c) the duration of the selected Interest Period, all of which
shall be specified in such manner as is necessary to comply with all
limitations on Loans outstanding hereunder.  If the Company shall fail to

accordance with this Section, such Loan will automatically, on the last day of
the current Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Loan
notwithstanding failure of the Company to comply with the immediately following
subsection (b).

(b)  So long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Company may on any Business Day, upon the Company's giving of a
notice in the form of Exhibit G (a "Notice of Conversion"), Convert all or a
portion of a Loan of one Type into a Loan of another Type.  In connection with
any Conversion of a LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the
last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan the Company as a condition
to such Conversion shall pay all amounts contemplated by Section 3.9.  Each
such Notice of Conversion shall be given within the time prescribed by Section
3.3.  Subject to the restrictions specified above, each Notice of Conversion
shall specify (a) the requested date of such Conversion, (b) the Type of Loan
to be Converted, (c) the portion of such Type of Loan to be


<PAGE>

Converted, (d) the Type of Loan such Loan is to be Converted into and (e) if
such Conversion is into a LIBOR Loan, the requested duration of the initial
Interest Period of such Loan.

(c)  No more than six separate Interest Periods in respect of LIBOR Loans
may be outstanding at any one time.

2.7.   MINIMUM AMOUNTS

Except for Conversions or prepayments made pursuant to Section 3.8., (a)
each borrowing of LIBOR Loans (including a Continuation of, or Conversion into,
LIBOR Loans) shall be in an amount at least equal to $1,000,000 and integral
multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof, (b) each borrowing of Base Rate Loans
(including a Continuation of, or Conversion into, Base Rate Loans) shall be in
an amount at least equal to $250,000 and integral multiples of $5,000 in excess
thereof, and (c) each voluntary prepayment of Loans shall be in an amount at
least equal to $100,000 and integral multiples thereof (borrowings, prepayments
or Conversions of Loans into Loans of different Types or, in the case of LIBOR
Loans, having different Interest Periods, shall be deemed to be separate
borrowings, prepayments or Conversions for purposes of the foregoing, one for
each Type or Interest Period).  The provisions of this Section shall not apply
to borrowings under Section 2.2.(b).

2.8.   FEES

(a)  The Company shall pay to the Lender on the Closing Date a closing fee
in the amount of $5,000.

(b)  If during any calendar month the daily average unused amount of the
Facility B Commitment for such month shall be greater than an amount equal to
65% of the Facility B Commitment, then the Company shall pay to the Lender,
during the period beginning on the first day of the following month through the
last day of the month in which the daily average unused amount of the Facility
B Commitment for such month shall first be less than such amount, a fee on the
daily average unused amount of the Facility B Commitment at a per annum rate,
computed in accordance with Section 3.2., equal to one-quarter of one percent
(0.25%).  Accrued unused commitment fees shall be payable monthly in arrears on
the last Business Day of each month.

(c)  All fees shall be fully earned and non-refundable upon receipt.

2.9.   NOTES

(a)  (i)  The Facility A Loans and the Facility A Term Loan shall be
evidenced by a single promissory note (the "FACILITY A NOTE") to be executed by
the Company in substantially the form of Exhibit H, dated the date hereof,
payable to the Lender in a principal amount equal to the amount of the Facility
A Commitment as originally in effect and otherwise duly completed.

(ii)  The Facility B Loans shall be evidenced by a promissory note
(the "FACILITY B NOTE") to be executed by the Company in substantially the form
of Exhibit I, dated the date hereof, payable to the Lender in a principal
amount equal to the amount of the Facility B Commitment as originally in effect
and otherwise duly completed.


<PAGE>

(b)  The date and amount of each Loan made by the Lender to the Company,
and each payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by
the Lender on its books and, prior to any transfer of the applicable Note
evidencing such Loans held by it, endorsed by the Lender on the schedule
attached to such Note or any continuation thereof; provided that the failure of
the Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
obligations of the Company to make a payment when due of any amount owing under
such Note.  Any such recordations or endorsements made by the Lender on its
books or such Note shall be conclusive and binding on the Company absent
manifest error.

2.10.  OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS

The Company shall have the right to prepay Loans in whole or in part at
any time or from time to time, without premium or penalty, except that in
connection with any prepayment of LIBOR Loans on a day other than the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Company as a condition to such
prepayment shall pay all amounts contemplated by Section 3.9. in connection
with such prepayment.  Optional prepayments of the Facility A Term Loan shall
be applied to reduce scheduled repayments of such Loan in inverse order of
maturity.

2.11.  MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS

(a)  LOANS IN EXCESS OF COMMITMENT.  If at any time (a) the aggregate
amount of either the Facility A Loans or the Facility B Loans outstanding shall
exceed the amount of the  Facility A Commitment or Facility B Commitment,
respectively, in effect at such time, or (b) after the Investor Guaranty has
been released pursuant to Section 2.14., the aggregate amount of the Facility B
Loans shall exceed the Lesser of (i) the Facility B Commitment or (ii) the
Borrowing Base, then, in each such case the Company shall, within one Business
Day, prepay such Loans in such amounts as shall be necessary to eliminate such
excess.

(b)  SWEEP OF OPERATING ACCOUNT.  At 5:00 p.m. of each Business Day, the
Company shall repay a principal amount of Facility B Loans by an amount equal
to the positive balance, if any, of available funds on deposit in the Operating
Account as determined by the Lender at such time.  The Company hereby
authorizes the Lender to deduct such amount from the Operating Account without
notice to the Company, and to apply such amount in repayment of the then
outstanding principal balance of Facility B Loans.  The provisions of this
subsection shall not become effective until the Company has executed and
delivered the Lender's customary documentation relating to its "Auto Borrow"
and "Auto Sweep" programs.

(c)  CERTAIN ACTIONS BY INVESTOR GUARANTOR AND AFFILIATES.  If, at any
time prior to the release of the Investor Guaranty in accordance with Section
2.14. hereof, any of the following shall occur:

(i) the Investor Guarantor (x) merges or consolidates with any Person
(other than a merger or consolidation with a Subsidiary of Safeguard
Scientifics, Inc. pursuant to which the Investor Guarantor is the
surviving entity); (y) dissolves, liquidates or ceases to exist, or takes
any action authorizing any of the foregoing or (z) sells, leases,
transfers or


<PAGE>

otherwise disposes of, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all
or substantially all of its assets; or

(ii) at any time both: (x) the amount of Revolving Loans (as defined
in the Guarantor Credit Agreement) which the Investor Guarantor could then
borrow under the Guarantor Credit Agreement shall be less than $3,500,000
and (y) the value of all Qualifying Securities (as defined below) PLUS all
cash and cash equivalents then held by the Investor Guarantor MINUS twice
the amount of Indebtedness then owing under the Guarantor Credit Agreement
shall be less than $7,000,000. For purposes of this subsection (iii), the
term "Qualifying Security" means any common stock owned by the Investor
Guarantor in a Subsidiary whose common stock (A) is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or some other principal
national securities exchange or has price quotations in the
over-the-counter market reported by the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotation System; (B) is not subject to any instrument,
document or agreement which in any way prohibits the sale of such common
stock by the Investor Guarantor for any specified period of time or
otherwise; and (C) the offer and sale of which by the Investor Guarantor
would not then be subject to any registration requirements or other
restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), or other Applicable Law, including without limitation, volume
limitations imposed under Rule 144 of the Securities Act; or

(iii) any event or condition of the types described in Sections 9.5.,
9.6., or 9.7. occurs or exists with respect to the Investor Guarantor; or

(iv) any representation, warranty or certification made or deemed to
be made in any Credit Document by the Investor Guarantor or any
certificate, financial statement or other information furnished in writing
to the Lender by or on behalf of the Investor Guarantor pursuant to the
provisions hereof or thereof, shall prove to have been false or misleading
in any material respect as of the time made or deemed to be made; or

(v) the Investor Guarantor fails to comply with any of its
obligations under its Guaranty and such failure continues for five days
after notice is made by the Lender to the Company of such failure.

then, (a) the Company shall, within one Business Day of the Lender's demand,
repay the entire outstanding principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid
interest on, the Facility B Loans and all other Obligations payable by the
Company hereunder relating to the Facility B Commitment and (b) the Lender may
upon written notice to the Company terminate the Facility B Commitment.

2.12.  CONVERSION TO TERM LOAN

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company may
elect to convert the aggregate principal amount of Facility A Loans outstanding
on the Facility A  Termination Date into a single term loan (the "Facility A
Term Loan") provided (a) the Company has given the


<PAGE>

Lender thirty-days' prior notice of the Company's intention to so convert the
Facility A Loans and (b) the conditions set forth in Section 4.2. have been
satisfied as of the date such conversion.

2.13.  USE OF PROCEEDS

The Company may use the proceeds of Loans to finance Acquisitions, for
working capital purposes and for other general corporate purposes.

2.14.  RELEASE OF INVESTOR GUARANTY

The Lender agrees, upon at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior
written request of the Company, to release the Investor Guarantor from its
obligations under and pursuant to the Investor Guaranty (other than those
obligations which survive the termination thereof), subject to the satisfaction
of the following conditions:

(a)  the Lender shall receive evidence satisfactory to the Lender of the
Company's receipt of at least $10,000,000 in Net Proceeds from an Equity
Issuance completed on or after the date hereof; and

(b)  no Default or Event of Default have occurred and be continuing as of
the proposed date of such release of the Investor Guarantor; and

(c)  no Default or Event of Default shall have ever occurred hereunder;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Lender may, in its sole discretion, waive the
condition set forth in this clause (c).

3.   PAYMENTS; COMPUTATIONS; TAXES; ETC.

3.1.   PAYMENTS

(a)  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of
principal, interest and other amounts to be made by the Company under this
Agreement and the Notes and, except to the extent otherwise provided therein,

been made on the next succeeding Business Day).

(b)  The Company shall, at the time of making each payment under this
Agreement or either Note, specify to the Lender the Loans or other Obligations
to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails to so
specify, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Lender
may apply such payment to the Loans in such manner as it may determine to be
appropriate).

(c)  If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or the Notes
would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day, such date shall be
extended to the next succeeding


<PAGE>

Business Day and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for
the period of such extension.

3.2.   COMPUTATIONS

year of 360 days comprised of twelve thirty-day months for the actual days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which such amounts are payable.

<PAGE>

3.4.   TAXES

(a)  Any and all payments by the Company hereunder shall be paid (except
to the extent required by law) free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding franchise
taxes and taxes based on net income imposed on the Lender by the United States
(or any political subdivision thereof) in which the Lender has its Applicable
Lending Office (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as
"Taxes").  If the Company shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Lender (i) the sum payable by
the Company shall be increased by the amount necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 3.4.) the Lender shall receive an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall
make such deductions, and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted
to the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority in accordance
with Applicable Law.

(b)  In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future stamp or
documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or
any other Credit Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c)  The Company will indemnify the Lender for the full amount of Taxes
and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction
on amounts payable under this Section 3.4.) paid by the Lender and any
liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly
or legally asserted.  Such indemnification shall be made within five Business
Days after the date of receipt of a written demand therefor from  the Lender.

(d)  Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes
withheld by the Company in respect of any payment to the Lender, the Company
will furnish to the Lender, at its address referred to in Section 10.2., the
original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

(e)  If the Lender claims any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section, the Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and
regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document reasonably
requested by the Company if the making of such a filing would avoid the need
for or reduce the amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter
accrue and would not, in the sole determination of  the Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to the Lender.

3.5.   ADDITIONAL COSTS

(a)  EVENTS ENTITLING THE LENDER TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION.  The Company
shall pay directly to the Lender from time to time such amounts as the Lender
may determine in good faith

<PAGE>

to be necessary to compensate it for any costs which it determines are
attributable to its making or maintaining any Loans or its obligation to make
any Loans hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by the Lender
hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation (such increases in
costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional
Costs") resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

(i)  changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to the
Lender under this Agreement or either of the Notes in respect of any of
such Loans (other than taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net
income of the Lender or of its Applicable Lending Office for any of such
Loans by the jurisdiction in which the Lender has its Applicable Lending
Office); or

(ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or
any deposits with or other liabilities of, the Lender (including any of
such Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR" in
Section 1.1.), or any commitment of the Lender (including the
Commitment) hereunder.

(b)  DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION.  Without limiting the effect
of the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.5. (but without duplication), the
Company shall pay directly to the Lender from time to time on request such
amounts as the Lender may determine to be necessary to compensate the Lender
(or, without duplication, the bank holding company of which the Lender is a
subsidiary) for any increased costs which it determines in good faith are
attributable to the maintenance by the Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office
or such bank holding company) of capital in respect of the Commitment or Loans
pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation, directive or request
(whether or not having the force of law) of any court or governmental or
monetary authority (i) following any Regulatory Change or (ii) implementing any
risk-based capital guideline or requirement (whether or not having the force of
law and whether or not the failure to comply therewith would be unlawful)
hereafter issued by any government or governmental or supervisory authority
implementing at the national level the Basle Accord (including, without
limitation, the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR Part 208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225,
Appendix A) and the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR Part 3, Appendix A)), such compensation to
include, without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of
return on assets or equity of the Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or
such bank holding company) to a level below that which the Lender (or any
Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company) could have achieved but
for such law, regulation, interpretation, directive or request.  For purposes
of this Section 3.5.(b), "Basle Accord" shall mean the proposals for risk-based
capital framework described by the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and
Supervisory Practices in its paper entitled "International Convergence of
Capital Measurement and Capital Standards" dated July 1988, as amended,
modified and supplemented and in effect from time to time or any replacement
thereof.

(c)  NOTICE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT ENTITLING LENDER TO
COMPENSATION.  The Lender shall notify the Company of any event occurring after
the date of this Agreement that will entitle the Lender to compensation under
Section 3.5.(a) or (b) as promptly as practicable and


<PAGE>

shall furnish to the Company a certificate setting forth the basis and amount
of each request by the Lender for compensation, together with calculations in
reasonable detail of such amount.  Determinations and allocations by the Lender
for purposes of this Section 3.5. of the effect of any Regulatory Change
pursuant to Section 3.5.(a), of the effect of capital maintained pursuant to
Section 3.5.(b) on its costs or rate of return of maintaining Loans or its
obligation to make Loans or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans,
and of the amounts required to compensate the Lender under this Section, shall
be made in a manner consistent with that applied by the Lender in similar
contexts and shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

3.6.   LIMITATION ON TYPES OF LOANS

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if on or prior to the
determination of LIBOR for any Interest Period the Lender determines (which
determination shall be conclusive) that:

(a)  quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred
to in the definition of "LIBOR" are not being provided in the relevant
amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates
of interest for LIBOR Loans as provided herein; or

(b)  the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of
LIBOR in this Agreement upon the basis of which the rate of interest for
LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined are not likely
to adequately cover the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining
LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Lender shall give the Company notice thereof, and so long as such
condition remains in effect, the Lender shall be under no obligation to make
additional LIBOR Loans, to Continue LIBOR Loans or to Convert Base Rate Loans
into LIBOR Loans, and the Company shall, on the last day(s) of the then-current
Interest Period(s) for the outstanding LIBOR Loans, either prepay such Loans or
Convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.6.

3.7.   ILLEGALITY

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if it becomes
unlawful for the Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain LIBOR
Loans hereunder, then the Lender shall promptly notify the Company thereof
and the Lender's obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate
Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such time as the Lender may
again make and maintain LIBOR Loans.

3.8.   TREATMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS

If the obligation of the Lender to make, Continue or Convert Base Rate
Loans into LIBOR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to either of the immediately
preceding Sections, all outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be automatically
Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the current Interest
Period(s) for such LIBOR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by
Sections 3.6. or 3.7., on such earlier date as the Lender may specify to the
Company)

<PAGE>

and, unless and until the Lender gives notice as provided below that the
circumstances specified in Sections 3.6. or 3.7. which gave rise to such
Conversion no longer exist:

(a)  to the extent that any LIBOR Loans have been so Converted, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise be
applied to such LIBOR Loans shall be applied instead to the Base
Rate Loans; and

(b)  all Loans which would otherwise be made or Continued as LIBOR
Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans and all Base
Rate Loans which would otherwise be Converted into LIBOR Loans shall
remain as Base Rate Loans.

If the Lender gives notice to the Company that the circumstances specified
in Sections 3.6. or 3.7. which gave rise to the Conversion of LIBOR Loans
pursuant to this Section no longer exist at a time when LIBOR Loans are
outstanding, the Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, at
the option of the Company.

3.9.   COMPENSATION

The Company shall pay the Lender such amount or amounts as shall be
sufficient to compensate the Lender for any loss, cost, or expense which the
Lender determines in good faith is attributable to: (a) any payment, prepayment
or Conversion of a LIBOR Loan for any reason (including, without limitation,
the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article 9.) on a date other than the
last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; (b) any prepayment of the
Facility A Term Loan while it bears interest at a fixed rate as provided in
Section 2.4.(a)(iii) for any reason (including, without limitation, the
acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article 9.) on a date other than the
Termination Date; or (c) any failure by the Company for any reason, including
without limitation, the failure of any of the conditions precedent specified in
Article 4. to be satisfied, to (i) borrow a LIBOR Loan from the Lender on the
date for such borrowing specified in the relevant Notice of Borrowing given
pursuant to Section 2.2.(a) or (ii) to convert the Facility A Loans into the
Facility A Term Loan pursuant to Section 2.12. after giving the Lender notice
of such conversion.  Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence,

Company or any other Loan Party which could have a Material Adverse Effect.

(e)  No proceeding, claim (other than routine claims for benefits),
lawsuit and/or investigation is existing or, to the Company's actual knowledge,
threatened concerning or involving any Employee Benefit Plan or Multiemployer
Plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or any other Loan Party.

Loan Parties has filed all federal income tax returns and all other tax returns
and reports, domestic and foreign, required to be filed by it and has paid all
taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges shown to be due and
payable by it on such returns or reports.  All such returns are true and

correct in all material respects.  Except as set forth on such Schedule, each

extension of credit) to, or Guarantee by, the Company or any other Loan Party,
or (b) any collective bargaining agreement, management agreement, employment
agreement or consulting agreement.  Neither the Company nor any other Loan
Party is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any corporate
restriction that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. The representations and warranties in subsection (b)
of the first sentence of this Section are made as of the Closing Date only.

5.13.  ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY MATTERS

The Company and each of the other Loan Parties has obtained all
Governmental Approvals which are required under Environmental Laws and is in
compliance with all terms and conditions of such Governmental Approvals the
failure with which to be in compliance would have a Materially Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and each other Loan Party is also in material compliance
with all other limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions,

intention of any Person to file or commence, any action, suit or proceeding

its material properties used in its business in sufficient working order and
condition so as to permit such Loan Party to conduct its business; and preserve

character usually insured by entities engaged in the same or similar business
similarly situated against loss or damage of the kinds and in the amounts

the Company and the other Loan Parties under the foregoing provisions of this
Section, in the


<PAGE>



event the Company or any of the other Loan Parties shall fail to maintain in
full force and effect insurance as required by the foregoing provisions of this
Section or any of the other Credit Documents, then the Lender may upon notice
to the Company or such other Loan Party, but shall have no obligation to,

property, and in any event before the same shall become delinquent or in
default, as well as all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies or
otherwise which, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien upon such properties or
any part thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such payment and discharge shall not
be required so long as the validity or amount thereof shall be contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings which effectively stay the execution of
any such Lien and the Company shall (or shall cause the applicable Loan Party
to) set aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP with
respect thereto.

6.6.   MAINTAINING RECORDS; ACCESS TO PROPERTIES AND INSPECTIONS

accountants therefor.

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect arising under any

facility owned or operated by the Company or any other Loan Party has been or
may be either (i) operated in violation of any Environmental Laws; (ii)
contaminated with any Hazardous Materials; or (iii) subject to any
government-imposed obligation to conduct any environmental investigation or
clean-up, any of which, in the good faith judgment of the Lender may impair in
any material respect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Company
or any of the other Loan Parties to satisfy any of their respective
Obligations, the Company shall, upon the written request of the Lender, at the
Company's sole cost and expense, conduct such investigation or study, through
retention of a consulting firm reasonably satisfactory to the Lender, as is
necessary in the good faith judgment of the Lender to demonstrate that no such
impairment could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.8.   ADDITIONAL SECURITY

If and to the extent requested by the Lender from time to time, execute
and deliver such additional documents and take such other action as may be
necessary or desirable in the reasonable opinion of the Lender in order to

Lender or its Texas Affiliate.

terminate their employment with the Company or otherwise cease to be employed

that could give rise to any material claim for indemnification from any party
under any Acquisition Document, assert or cause the assertion of such claim
against such party before the date on which such claim may no longer be made
under such Acquisition Document, and in asserting any such claim shall comply
with all requirements for asserting such claims under the Acquisition Documents.

Party including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation or litigation or
other proceedings (but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages

repaid.

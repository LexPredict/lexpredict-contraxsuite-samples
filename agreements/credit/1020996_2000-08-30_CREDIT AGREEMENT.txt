outstanding Loans immediately after the making of each Loan shall not exceed the
Total Commitment. Within such limit, the Company may borrow, prepay, repay and
reborrow pursuant to this Subsection 2.1.

1.5 Manner of Borrowing. The Company shall give the Agent a duly
completed Notice of Borrowing not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the Business Day immediately preceding the date of a Borrowing of a Base Rate
Loan and at least three Business Days before a Borrowing of a Eurodollar Rate
Loan. Each such Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify: (i)
the amount of such Borrowing, which in the case of a Base Rate Loan shall be in
the principal amount of $100,000 or a multiple thereof and in the case of a
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be in the principal amount of not less than$250,000
or any greater amount which is an integral multiple thereof; (ii) the date of

Each Lender will note on its internal records the date and amount of each Loan
made by such Lender, the date and amount of each repayment of principal thereof

<PAGE>   17


(a) The Company shall repay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders
the outstanding principal amount of each Lender's Loans on the Final Maturity
Date. In addition, if at any time the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
all Loans exceeds the Total Commitment, then the Company shall immediately pay
to the Agent for the account of the Lenders the amount equal to such excess,
together with accrued interest thereon.

(b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may at
any time and from time to time prepay the then outstanding Base Rate Loans
comprising any Borrowing, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon
not less than one (1) Business Day's irrevocable notice to the Agent, specifying
the date and amount of prepayment and, if more than one such Borrowing is
outstanding, which Borrowing is to be prepaid. Upon receipt of any such notice,
the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Any notice of prepayment
given by the Company shall obligate the Company to make the prepayment specified
in such notice on the date specified therein. Accrued interest on any amount
prepaid in accordance with the terms hereof shall, in accordance with Subsection
2.6, be payable on the date such prepayment is required to be made as provided
herein. Any partial prepayment of a Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Loans shall
be in an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or whole multiples of $100,000
in excess thereof, and shall not result in the remaining amount of such
Borrowing being less than $100,000.

(c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may at
any time and from time to time prepay the then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans
comprising any Borrowing, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon
not less than three (3) Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Agent,
specifying the date and amount of prepayment and, if more than one such
Borrowing is outstanding, which Borrowing is to be prepaid. Upon receipt of any
such notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Any notice of
prepayment given by the Company shall obligate the Company to make the
prepayment specified in such notice on the date specified therein. Accrued
interest on any amount prepaid in accordance with the terms hereof shall, in
accordance with Subsection 2.6, be payable on the date such prepayment is
required to be made as provided herein. If such prepayment occurs on a date that
is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate
Loan, the Company shall pay any amounts as shall be sufficient (in the
reasonable opinion of each Lender) to compensate such Lender for any reasonable
losses, costs or expenses (excluding any losses of anticipated profit), as
certified by such Lender (such certification setting forth the basis for such
compensation), which such Lender may reasonably incur as a result of such
prepayment, including without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by
reason of funds liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired
by such Lender to fund or maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan and any
administrative costs, expenses or charges of the Lender as a result thereof. Any
partial prepayment of a Borrowing comprised of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be
in an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or whole multiples of $100,000 in
excess thereof, and shall not result in the remaining amount of such Borrowing
being less than $100,000.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding paragraph, compensation
shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest that otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so prepaid
for the period from the date of such prepayment to the last day of the then
current Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan at the applicable rate of
interest for
<PAGE>   18


such Eurodollar Rate Loan provided for herein over (ii) the amount of interest
that otherwise would have accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum
equal to the interest component of the amount the Lender would have bid in the
London interbank market for Dollar deposits of leading banks in amounts
comparable to such principal amount and with maturities comparable to such
period (as reasonably determined by the Lender), if the Lender has match-funded
such Eurodollar Rate Loan, or the Lender's cost of funds, if the Lender has not
match-funded. Such Lender will furnish to the Company a certificate setting
forth the basis and amount of each request by the Lender for compensation under
this Subsection 2.5.

1.9 Payment of Interest.

(a) The Company shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Base Rate Loan from and including the date of such Base Rate Loan to but
not including the date on which such Loan is paid in full at a fluctuating rate
per annum equal to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable
Margin. Such interest shall be due and payable on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto.

(b) The Company shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Eurodollar Rate Loan from and including the date of such Loan to but not
including the date on which such Loan is paid in full at a rate per annum equal
to the Eurodollar Rate in effect for the relevant Interest Period plus the
Applicable Margin. Such interest shall be due and payable on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing subparagraphs (a) and (b), if the
Company shall fail to pay any installment of principal of or interest on any
Loan when due, or if any other Event of Default shall occur, then the Company
shall pay interest as provided in Subsection 8.4.

(d) For purposes of determining whether a Level II Borrowing exists,
the Company shall determine the value of the Cash and Eligible Securities owned
by the Company on the date of each new Level II Borrowing and no less frequently
than each month end thereafter so long as a Level II Borrowing remains
outstanding and shall certify to such value in a certificate delivered to the
Agent, provided however, if the Company fails to provide the Agent with such a
certificate, with respect to all Borrowings in excess of a Level I Borrowing,
the Agent shall deem there to be a Level III Borrowing; provided further, if the
Company has a Level II Borrowing Outstanding at any time and the Company has
knowledge that it does not meet the requirements for a Level II Borrowing, the
Company shall notify the Agent of such knowledge.

1.10 Conversion or Continuation of Loans. The Company shall have the
right to Convert Loans of one type into Loans of another type or to Continue
Eurodollar Rate Loans, at any time or from time to time, provided that: (a) the
Company shall give the Agent a Notice of Continuation or Conversion in the form
of Exhibit B-2, as applicable, prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date
at least (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of the Interest
Period of any Loan to be Converted into or Continued as a Eurodollar Rate Loan
and (ii) one (1) Business Day prior to the last day of the Interest Period of
any Loan to be Converted into a Base Rate Loan; (b) Eurodollar Rate Loans may be
Converted or Continued only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Loans; (c) each Conversion or Continuation of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be in
an amount at least
<PAGE>   19


equal to $100,000 or in any greater amount which is an integral multiple
thereof; (d) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time of any Conversion or Continuation of any such Loan into a subsequent
Interest Period; (e) accrued interest on the Loan (or portion thereof) being
Converted or Continued shall be paid by the Company at the time of Continuation
or Conversion; and (f) each request for a Continuation as or Conversion to a
Eurodollar Rate Loan which fails to state an applicable Interest Period shall be
deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one (1) month.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if, upon the
expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the
Company shall fail to give a Notice of Continuation or Conversion as set forth
in this Subsection 2.7, the Company shall be deemed to have given a Notice of
Continuation of such Eurodollar Rate Loan in principal amount equal to the
outstanding principal amount of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having an Interest
Period of one (1) month.

1.11 Extension of Final Maturity Date. So long as no Default exists,
the Final Maturity Date shall automatically be extended for an additional 364
days from the then current Final Maturity Date unless the Company or any Lender
provides written notice to the Agent no later than 120 days prior to such Final
Maturity Date that it does not agree to such extension; provided however, the
Final Maturity Date shall not be so extended more than three (3) times.

1.12 Computation of Interest and Fees. All interest and fees shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and paid for the actual days elapsed.
Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Base
Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which
such change is announced. In computing the amount of interest or fees payable in
respect of any period, the first day of such period shall be included and the
last day of such period shall be excluded. All computations of interest and like
payments hereunder on the Loans shall, in the absence of clearly demonstrable
error, be considered correct and binding on the Company and each Lender, unless
within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of any notice by the Agent of
such outstanding amount, the Company or any Lender notifies the Agent to the
contrary.

1.13 Capital Adequacy. (a) In the event that any Lender shall have
determined that the adoption or implementation of, or any change in, any law,
rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, capital maintenance or
similar requirement or any change in the interpretation or application thereof
or compliance by any Lender or any corporation controlling any Lender with any
request, guideline, policy or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's or such Lender's controlling corporation's capital as a consequence of
its obligations hereunder or its Loans to a level below that which such Lender
or such Lender's controlling corporation could have achieved but for such
adoption, implementation, change or compliance (taking into consideration such
Lender's or such Lender's controlling corporation's policies with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon demand by such Lender to the
Company (with a copy to the Agent), the Company shall pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
<PAGE>   20


(b) Any such Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Agent upon
becoming aware of any event which will cause it to demand payment of any
additional amount pursuant to paragraph (a) above and shall furnish to the
Company a certificate containing a determination made in good faith of such
additional amount and the justification therefor and showing in reasonable
detail the computation thereof. Determinations and allocations by any Lender of
any additional amounts payable by the Company pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
Subsection 2.10 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(c) If any additional amount becomes or will in the future become
payable for the account of any Lender under paragraph (a) of this Subsection
2.10, then such Lender will (if so requested by the Company, but without
prejudice to the provisions of this Subsection 2.10 ) consult with the Company
and the Agent with a view to agreeing upon a mutually acceptable alternative
arrangement (including the transfer of such Lender's Lending Office to another
jurisdiction, if, in its sole discretion, such transfer is not in any way
disadvantageous to it or contrary to its policies) which will avoid or minimize
the payment of such additional amount in the future and which is not prejudicial
to it.

(d) The agreements contained in this Subsection 2.10 shall survive for
a period of one year following repayment of the Obligations.

1.14 Increased Costs. (a) If after the date hereof, due to either (i)
the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation or enforcement of,
any law, regulation, order, ruling, directive, guideline or request, or (ii) the
compliance with any order, ruling, directive, guideline or request from any
central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of
law) issued, announced, published, promulgated or made after the date hereof,
there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or
making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans, then the Company shall be
liable for, and shall from time to time, within thirty (30) days following a
demand by the Lender, pay to the Agent for the account of the Lender additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided,
however, that before making any such demand, the Lender agrees to use reasonable
efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office if the making of such a
designation would allow the Lender or its Lending Office to continue to perform
its obligations to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or to continue to fund or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Loans and would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Lender,
be otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender. A certificate substantiating the
amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Company by the Lender, shall be
conclusive, absent demonstrable error.

(b) Any such Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Agent upon
becoming aware of any event which will cause it to demand payment of any
additional amount pursuant to paragraph (a) above and shall furnish to the
Company a certificate containing a determination made in good faith of such
additional amount and the justification therefor and showing in reasonable
detail the computation thereof. Determinations and allocations by any Lender of
any additional amounts payable by the Company pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
Subsection 2.11 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
<PAGE>   21


(c) If any additional amount becomes or will in the future become
payable for the account of any Lender under paragraph (a) of this Subsection
2.11, then such Lender will (if so requested by the Company, but without
prejudice to the provisions of this Subsection 2.11) consult with the Company
and the Agent with a view to agreeing upon a mutually acceptable alternative
arrangement (including the transfer of such Lender's Lending Office to another
jurisdiction, if, in its sole discretion, such transfer is not in any way
disadvantageous to it or contrary to its policies) which will avoid or minimize
the payment of such additional amount in the future and which is not prejudicial
to it.

(d) The agreements contained in this Subsection 2.11 shall survive for
a period of one year following repayment of the Obligations.

1.15 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if after the date hereof the introduction of, or any change in or in the
interpretation or enforcement of, any law, regulation, order, ruling, directive,
guideline or request shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Loans or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder, then,
on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company, (i) the obligation of the
Lender to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall terminate (and the Lender shall make
all of its Loans as Base Rate Loans notwithstanding any election by the Company
to have the Lender make Eurodollar Rate Loans) and (ii) if legally permissible,
at the end of the current Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loans,
otherwise five Business Days after such notice and demand, all Eurodollar Rate
Loans of the Lender then outstanding will automatically convert into Base Rate
Loans; provided, however, that before making any such demand, the Lender agrees
to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and
regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Lending Office if the making
of such a designation would allow the Lender or its Lending Office to continue
to perform its obligations to make Eurodollar Rate Loans and would not, in the
judgment of the Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender. A
certificate describing such introduction or change in or in the interpretation
or enforcement of such law, regulation, order, ruling, directive, guideline or
request, submitted to the Company by such Lender, shall be conclusive evidence
of such introduction, change, interpretation or enforcement, absent demonstrable
error. The Lender and the Company agree to negotiate in good faith in order to
agree upon a mutually acceptable mechanism to provide that Eurodollar Rate Loans
made by the Lender as to which the foregoing conditions occur shall convert into
Base Rate Loans.

jurisdiction under the laws of which it is organized or in which it has its
principal office or its Lending Office or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein (such non-excluded taxes being called "Taxes") . If
any Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Agent or
any Lender hereunder or under the Notes, the amounts so payable shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Agent or such Lender (after
payment of all Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder or
under the Notes at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and
the Notes. Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Company, as promptly as
possible thereafter, the Company shall send to the Agent for its own account or
for the account of each Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an
original official receipt showing payment thereof. If the Company fails to pay
Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the
Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Company
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Agent and the Lenders against, and
reimburse the Agent and the Lenders upon demand for, any incremental taxes,
interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a
result of any such failure.
<PAGE>   23


(b) Each Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Agent upon
becoming aware of any event which will cause the Company to pay any additional
amount pursuant to paragraph (a) above.

1.19 Assumed Payments. Unless the Agent shall have been notified by a
Lender or the Company prior to the date on which such Lender or the Company is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (in the case of a Lender) the proceeds
of a Loan to be made by it hereunder or (in the case of the Company) a payment
to the Agent for account of one or more of the Lenders hereunder (such payment
being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice shall be effective
upon receipt, that it does not intend to make the Required Payment to the Agent,
the Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in
reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) , make the amount
thereof available to the intended recipient(s) on such date and, if such Lender
or the Company (as the case may be) has not in fact made the Required Payment to
the Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay to the Agent
the amount so made available. In addition, the party that failed to make the
Required Payment shall, on demand, pay interest to the Agent for its own account
in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was
so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at
a rate equal to the sum of the Base Rate plus 2% per annum; provided, however,
that if the party that failed to make the Required Payment is a Lender, such
interest shall accrue at the Federal Funds Rate for the first three Business
Days such amount is unpaid and thereafter at the Base Rate plus 2% per annum.

SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
<PAGE>   26


The Company hereby makes the following representations and warranties
to the Agent and to each Lender.

1.22 Financial Condition. (a) The consolidated balance sheets of the
Company as at June 30, 1997 and 1998 and 1999 and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' investment and cash flows for the fiscal
year ended on each such date, audited by Price Waterhouse, copies of which have
heretofore been furnished to the Agent and to each Lender, are complete and
correct and present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Company
as at each such date, and the consolidated results of its operations and cash
flows for the fiscal years then ended. All such financial statements, including
the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by
such accountants or officer, as the case may be, and as disclosed therein).


(b) As of the date hereof, the Company does not have any material
liability or obligation of any nature, absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise, or any material judgment or long term lease or unusual forward or
long term commitment, which is not reflected in the financial statements
referred to in Subsection 5.1(a), or the notes accompanying such financial
statements, or otherwise set forth on Schedule 4.1 other than liabilities and
obligations incurred under this Agreement.

(c) The Company is not entering into the arrangements contemplated
hereby and by the Related Documents nor does it intend to make any transfer or
incur any obligations hereunder or thereunder with actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors. On and as of the Closing
Date, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the transactions, contemplated
hereby (x) the Company will not have incurred nor does the Company intend or
believe that it will incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such
debts mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received
from any source and amounts payable on or in respect of any of its debts); (y)
the Company, after taking into account all other anticipated uses of its cash,
anticipates being able to pay all amounts on or in respect of its debts when
such amounts are required to be paid; and (z) the Company has sufficient capital
with which to conduct its present and proposed business and its property does
not constitute unreasonably small capital with which to conduct its present or
proposed business. For purposes of this Subsection 5.1(c), "debt" means any
liability on a claim, and a "claim" means a (i) right to payment whether or not
such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured
or unsecured; or (ii) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if
such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable
remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, secured or unsecured. On the date of each Borrowing (and after
giving effect to all Borrowings as of such date), the representations set forth
in this Subsection 5.1(c) shall be true and correct with respect to the Company
on such date.

1.23 No Change. Since June 30, 1999, there has been no material adverse
change in the business, operations, prospects, or financial condition of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in any of the Collateral or the ability of
the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Related Document to which it is a party.

Significant Subsidiary other than Coverdell.

the Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations enforceable against it in
accordance with their respective terms except as enforcement of such terms may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the rights

filing with or other act by or in respect of any Governmental Authority or any
other Person is required in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance by the Company or any Subsidiary of this Agreement and the Related
Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and
therein, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and
effect. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related Documents

litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or

have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, prospects or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on
the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement and
the Related Documents to which it is a party or (b) which questions or would
question the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the Related
Documents.

1.29 No Default. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of or in default under any term or provision of any (a) charter or
by-law or (b) mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, instrument, law, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, order, writ or injunction applicable to it, except
in the case of this clause (b) for such violations or defaults that would not
have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, prospects or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on

this Agreement and the Related Documents to which it is a party. No Default has
occurred and is continuing.

1.30 Ownership of Property; Liens. (a) The Company and each of its
Significant Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, all its real property and other property, subject in each case
only to encumbrances that do not materially adversely affect its ability to use

caused to be filed all tax returns that are required to be filed and have paid

of such Board of Governors. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
not use the proceeds of any Loan hereunder for the purchase of the Company's

Subsidiaries or, at the request or behest of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, at any adjoining site, so as to require a license, permit or
authorization of any type from any Governmental Authority other than licenses,

failure to obtain such licenses, permits or authorizations could not have a
material adverse effect on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (c) no
claim has been made against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
best of its knowledge, against any predecessor in respect of any "facility"
owned, leased or operated by it under CERCLA, or under a federal, state, local
or municipal statute, ordinance or regulation in respect of the environment, or
by the Environmental Protection Agency or by any federal, state, local or
municipal enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the protection of the
environment, or by any private Person bringing an action in respect of or under

this Agreement, or by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in the Related
Documents to which it is a party or in any other document furnished from time to
time in connection herewith or therewith, contains any misrepresentation of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements herein or therein not misleading. There is no fact known to the
Company which materially adversely affects, or which reasonably could be
expected in the future to materially adversely affect, the business, operations,
prospects or financial condition of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and the Related Documents.

1.38 Collateral. The Security Agreement and each Subsidiary Security
Agreement creates or will create a valid security interest in favor of the

Collateral described therein securing the payment of the obligations secured
thereby. All action necessary to perfect the security interest of the Collateral
Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the Lender, in such Collateral has been,
or will be, taken, and such security interest has, or will have, priority over
all other Liens except any perfected Liens arising in connection with any
Capitalized Lease entered into by the Company.

list of agreements between the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries
and any other Person providing for employment, severance, deferred or bonus

true, correct and complete copy of each agreement or other document
<PAGE>   31


listed on Schedule 5.18 has been provided to the Agent which shall provide
copies to each of the Lenders.

1.40 Dividends. Since June 30, 1994, the Company has not declared or
paid any dividends (other than dividends declared but not paid on the Series E
Preferred Stock and the Series F Preferred Stock of the Company) or made any
other distributions in respect of its capital stock or redeemed, retired,
purchased or otherwise acquired for value any shares of its capital stock other

effect of the possible failure of computer software, hardware and firmware
systems and equipment containing embedded computer chips to properly receive,
transmit, process, manipulate, store, retrieve, re-transmit or in any other way
utilize data and information due to the occurrence of the year 2000 or the
inclusion of dates on or after January 1, 2000. To the best of the Company's
knowledge, the Company's and its Subsidiaries' computer and other systems used
in its business operations currently operate in a manner so that as of the date
hereof on and after December 31, 1999 the Company and its Subsidiaries will be
able to operate their business in the same manner as they are operating as of
the date hereof.

1.42 Use of Proceeds. The Company shall use the proceeds of each Loan
for (i) working capital and general corporate purposes and (ii) the purchase of
the Company's common stock; provided however, no more than $10,000,000 of the
Total Commitment shall be used for the purpose described in subdivision (ii) of
this Subsection 5.21.

party.

1.46 Conduct of Business and Maintenance of Existence. The Company will

or upon the request of the Lenders the Agent shall, by notice of default to the
Company, declare the Obligations to be due and payable forthwith, whereupon the
same shall immediately become due and payable. In the event of a declaration by
the Agent pursuant to clause (b) (ii) above, the Agent may, and at the request
of the Lenders the Agent shall, enforce its rights and remedies hereunder and
under any other document or instrument delivered in connection herewith,
including directing the Collateral Agent to enforce any or all of its rights and
remedies under the Security Agreement, the Pledged Securities Documents, any
Subsidiary Guaranty and any Subsidiary Security Agreement. Except as expressly
provided above in this Subsection 8.2, presentment, demand, protest and all
other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived.

1.71 Set-Off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Agent or
the Lenders provided by law, the Agent and each Lender shall have the right,
without prior notice to the Company, any such notice being expressly waived by
the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default, to set off and apply against any indebtedness, whether
matured or unmatured, of the Company to the Agent or such Lender, any amount
owing from the Agent or such Lender at any of its branches or offices or from a
corporation controlling the Agent or such Lender to the Company at, or at any
time after, the occurrence of such Event of Default. The
<PAGE>   43


Agent and each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Agent after
any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

1.72 Default Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, (a) if the Company shall fail to pay any amount owing
to the Agent or any Lender under this Agreement when due (whether at stated due
date, on acceleration or otherwise), then the Company will pay interest (before,
as well as after, judgment) on demand to the Agent or such Lender, as the case
may be, on the amount in default from the date such payment became due until
payment in full at a rate equal to the sum of the Base Rate plus 2% per annum,
such rate to change as and when the Base Rate changes and (b) if any Event of
Default shall occur, then during the period such Event of Default shall be
continuing, the rate of interest payable hereunder shall be the rate as provided
in clause (a) above.


SECTION 9. THE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

1.73 Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints each of the Agent and the Collateral Agent as the agents of such Lender
under this Agreement and the Related Documents, and each Lender irrevocably
authorizes the Agent and the Collateral Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and the Related Documents and to exercise
such powers and perform such duties as are delegated to the Agent or the
Collateral Agent, as the case may be, by the terms hereof or thereof, together
with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any Related Document or
otherwise exist against the Agent or the Collateral Agent.

1.74 Delegation of Duties. The Agent and the Collateral Agent may
execute any of their duties under this Agreement and the Related Documents by or
through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Neither the Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by them with reasonable care except to the
extent otherwise required by Subsection 9.3.

1.75 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent
nor any of their respective partners, officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action
lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Agreement or any Related Document (except for its or such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any
manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties made by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any officer thereof
contained in this Agreement or any Related Document or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in or received
by the Agent or the Collateral Agent under or in connection with this Agreement
or any Related Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness (except its
own due execution hereof), genuineness, enforceability or
<PAGE>   44


sufficiency of this Agreement or any Related Document or for any failure of the
Company to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. Except as otherwise
provided herein, neither the Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be under any
obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any Related Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of the Company or any of its Affiliates. Neither the Agent nor the
Collateral Agent shall be responsible to any Lender for the effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any Related Document or for any representations, warranties,
recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral
statement or any financial or other statements, instruments, reports,
certificates or any other documents in connection herewith or therewith
furnished, or made in reliance on information furnished by or on behalf of the
Company, by the Agent or the Collateral Agent to the Lenders or by or on behalf
of the Company to the Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender.

1.76 Reliance by Agent and Collateral Agent. The Agent and the
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to the Company), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Agent and the Collateral Agent. The Agent and the Collateral
Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Agent or the Collateral Agent. The Agent and the
Collateral Agent shall each be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action under this Agreement or any Related Document unless it shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Lenders as it deems appropriate or it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and
all liability and expense (other than any liability or expense resulting from
the Agent's or the Collateral Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct)
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. The Agent and the Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected
in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any Related
Document in accordance with a request of the Lenders, and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all future
holders of the Notes.

1.77 Notice of Failure to Perform. Unless the Agent has actual notice
of a Default, the Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or of the failure of the Company to satisfy any
condition to borrowing hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a
Lender or the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or
failure and stating that such notice is a "notice of failure to perform its
obligations". In the event that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent
shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. In the case of any Default,
the Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default as shall be
reasonably directed by the Lenders, provided, however, that unless and until the
Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action for the protection and preservation of the
Collateral as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. Each
Lender agrees that it shall not make any demand for repayment of any amounts
payable to such Lender hereunder unless each Lender agrees to make a demand for
repayment of all
<PAGE>   45


amounts payable to such Lender. Prior to taking any such actions, the Lenders
shall consult with each other and the Agent to determine the general plan of
action and the steps to be taken in connection with such action, and they shall
continue to consult with one another with respect thereto.

1.78 Credit Decision. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither
the Agent nor the Collateral Agent nor any of their respective partners,
officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by
the Agent or the Collateral Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of the Company, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Agent or the Collateral Agent to any Lender. Each Lender
represents to the Agent and the Collateral Agent that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender, and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Company and made its
own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each
Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition
and creditworthiness of the Company. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent
hereunder or are furnished to the Agent pursuant to the terms hereof in
sufficient copies or counterparts for or for the account of the Lenders, the
Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any
credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Company or any of its
Affiliates which may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its
partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates.

1.79 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent and the
Collateral Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company and without
limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), ratably according to their
respective Percentages of Total Commitment, from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Notes)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent or the Collateral Agent
in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Related
Documents, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted
by the Agent or the Collateral Agent under or in connection with any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of
any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely
from the Agent's or the Collateral Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The agreements in this Subsection 9.7 shall survive the repayment of
the Obligations.

1.80 Individual Capacity. The Agent, the Collateral Agent and their
respective Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally
engage in any kind of business with the
<PAGE>   46


Company and any of its Subsidiaries as though it were not the Agent or the
Collateral Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note
issued to it, the Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement and the Related Documents as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent or the Collateral Agent, and
the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Agent and the Collateral
Agent in their individual capacities.

1.81 Successor Agents. Subject to the last sentence of this Subsection
9.9, the Agent and the Collateral Agent may resign as Agent or Collateral Agent,
as the case may be, at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders
and the Company and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the
Lenders, provided that no such resignation or removal shall become effective
until a successor Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall have been
appointed and shall have accepted such appointment as provided in this
Subsection 9.9. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Lenders shall have the
right to appoint a successor Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be. If
no successor Agent or Collateral Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Agent's or Collateral Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the
Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent or Collateral Agent, then, upon five
Business Days' notice to the Company and the Lenders, the retiring Agent or
Collateral Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent or
Collateral Agent, as the case may be, which shall be a bank which maintains an
office in the United States, or a commercial bank organized under the laws of
the United States of America or of any State thereof, or any Affiliate of such a
bank, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder by a
successor Agent or Collateral Agent, such successor Agent or Collateral Agent,
as the case may be, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent or Collateral Agent,
as the case may be, and the retiring Agent or Collateral Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After the
retiring Agent's or Collateral Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as such
agent, the provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was such agent under this
Agreement. Anything in this Subsection 9.9 to the contrary notwithstanding, so
long as the Company has not failed to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or under any Related Document, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. agrees
not to resign as Agent or Collateral Agent or to take any action in its capacity
as a Lender to remove itself as Agent or Collateral Agent.

reimburse the Agent for all its out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of, and any amendment,
restatement, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the Related
Documents, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and

enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement or the Related
Documents, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel to the Agent and to each Lender, (c) to pay, and indemnify and hold

<PAGE>   49



or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment,
supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of,
this Agreement or the Related Documents, and (d) to pay, and indemnify and hold
harmless each Lender, the Agent and the Collateral Agent from and against, any
and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel) or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever incurred with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement,
performance and administration of this Agreement and the Related Documents (all
the foregoing, collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"), provided that the
Company shall have no obligation hereunder to the Agent, the Collateral Agent or
any Lender with respect to indemnified liabilities arising from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent, the Collateral Agent or any such
Lender. The agreements in this Subsection 10.5 shall survive the repayment of
the Obligations.

1.87 Benefit of Agreement; Participations; Assignments (a) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the
Lenders, the Agent, the Collateral Agent and their respective successors and
assigns, except that (i) the Company may not assign or transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
each Lender and (ii) the Lenders may assign or transfer their respective rights
or obligations under this Agreement only as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c)
of this Subsection 10.6. Any Lender may from time to time change the office,
branch or agency of such Lender at which the Loans are made or carried; provided
that if at the time of any change from one office, branch or agency to another
the effect thereof would be to increase any amount payable by the Company under
this Agreement then such change shall not be made without the prior written
consent of the Company.

(b) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more
banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan
owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, or any other rights and
obligations of such Lender hereunder. In the event of any such sale by a Lender
of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement to the other parties under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for
all purposes under this Agreement, and the Company and the Agent shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. The Company agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Subsection 3.4 with respect to
its participation in the Loans outstanding from time to time; provided that no
Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such
Subsection than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in
respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender
to such Participant had no such transfer occurred. No Participant shall have the
right to consent to any amendment to, or waiver of, any provision of this
Agreement, except any such amendment or waiver which would require the consent
of all of the Lenders pursuant to Subsection 9.1.

(c) Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph (c), any Lender may,
in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with
applicable law, at any time sell to any Lender or to one or more additional
banks or financial institutions (each an "Assignee") all or
<PAGE>   50


any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes
pursuant to an assignment agreement between such Assignee and such transferor
Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit F, with the consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Such assignment agreement
shall be executed by such Assignee and such transferor Lender and shall be
delivered to the Agent for acceptance by the Agent not less than five Business
Days before the proposed effective date of such assignment, together with the
payment of a $2,000 assignment fee for the Agent. Upon such execution, delivery,
acceptance and payment, from and after the effective date specified in such
assignment agreement, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the portion of the rights and obligations of the transferor
Lender purchased by it, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder
and under the Related Documents and (y) the transferor Lender thereunder shall,
to the extent of the portion of its rights and obligations so sold, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an assignment
agreement covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto) . On or after the effective date specified in such assignment
agreement, upon request of the transferor Lender or the Assignee, the Company
shall issue a new Note to the transferor Lender and/or the Assignee. Anything in
this paragraph (c) notwithstanding, no transfer shall be made pursuant to this
paragraph (c) if (i) such transfer by any one transferor Lender to any one
Assignee which is not a Lender is in respect of less than $1,000,000 of the
rights and obligations of such transferor Lender, or (ii) when less than all of
the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender is transferred, the amount
held by any transferor Lender would be less than $1,000,000 after giving effect
to such transfer.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any Lender may pledge, hypothecate or otherwise grant a security
interest in all or any part of its rights hereunder or under its Note to any
Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge, hypothecation or grant shall
relieve such Lender of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

1.88 Sharing of Payments If any Lender (a "benefitted Lender") shall at
any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon,
or receive any Collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such
payment to and Collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of
such other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, such benefitted Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders such portion of each such other
Lender's Loans, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any
such Collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such Collateral or
proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such
benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and
benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The
Company agrees, to the extent it may do so under applicable law, that each
Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may exercise all rights
of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to
such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

1.89 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, all
of which counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument.
<PAGE>   51


1.90 Headings The Section and Subsection headings in this Agreement are
for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation
hereof.

1.91 Obligations Several. The rights and obligations of each Lender
hereunder is several, and no Lender shall be responsible for the obligations of
any other Lender hereunder. The amounts payable by the Company at any time
hereunder or under any Note to each Lender shall be a separate and independent
debt and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising
hereunder and thereunder and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender or
the Agent to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings
for such purpose. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken by
Lenders pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute Lenders to be a
partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity.

1.92 Governing Law THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.

1.93 Submission to Jurisdiction The Company hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally: (i) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Related Document, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the
non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, the

agrees not to plead or claim the same; (iii) agrees that service of process in
any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by

postage prepaid, to the Company at its address set forth in or designated

right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall
limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction.

1.94 Waiver of Jury Trial EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AS TO ANY
ISSUE RELATING HERETO IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 1.1

1.95 Severability Any provision of this Agreement (or any Related
Document) that is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall,
as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such illegality,
invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof (or thereof) or affecting the legality, validity or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree to negotiate
in good faith to replace any illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement (or such Related Document) with a legal, valid and enforceable
provision that, to the extent possible, will preserve the economic bargain of
this
<PAGE>   52



Agreement (or such Related Document), or to otherwise amend this Agreement (or

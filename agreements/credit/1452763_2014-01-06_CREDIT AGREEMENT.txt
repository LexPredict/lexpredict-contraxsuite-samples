2.         REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY.





2.1       Revolving Loan.





(a)       Revolving Loan Commitment.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of Borrower set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, Lender agrees to make such Revolving Loans at such times as Borrower may from time to time request, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, until, but not including, the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, and in such amounts as Borrower may from time to time request up to the Revolving Loan Availability (and subject at all times to the amounts available to be borrowed in accordance herewith); provided, however, that the aggregate principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Revolving Loan Availability; and further provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents to the contrary, each Revolving Loan requested by Borrower under this Agreement shall be subject to Lender’s approval, which approval may be given or withheld in Lender’s sole and absolute discretion.   Revolving Loans made by Lender may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, borrowed again up to, but not including, the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, unless the Revolving Loans are otherwise terminated or extended as provided in this Agreement. The Revolving Loans shall be used by Borrower solely for ongoing working capital purposes.















12





















(b)       Increase to Revolving Loan Commitment.  Borrower may request and the Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion (employing substantially the same analysis and metrics the Lender used when determining to originally extend credit hereunder), agree that on such later indeterminate dates, Lender further increases the Revolving Loan Commitment; and Lender, in its sole discretion, may, but in any event, is not required to, make available such additional  Revolving  Loan  Commitment  increases  to  Borrower  provided  the  following conditions have been satisfied, in Lender’s sole and absolute discretion:







(i)        no Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing, or result from the applicable increase of the Revolving Loan Commitment;




(ii)       Borrower  shall  have  executed  and  delivered  a  new  or  revised Revolving Note;





(iii)     after giving effect to such increase, the amount of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans shall not be in excess of the Revolving Loan Availability;







(iv)      Lender shall have reviewed and accepted, in its sole and absolute discretion, the amount and type of current and historical Receipts of the Credit Parties, or other Collateral required for the increase; and







(v)       Lender shall have received any and all additional documents or agreements included in Section 3 hereof as it shall require in its sole discretion.





(c)   Revolving Loan Interest and Payments.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans shall be repaid on or before the Revolving Loan Maturity Date.   Principal amounts repaid on the Revolving Notes may be re-borrowed.   The principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time shall bear interest at the Interest Rate. The Receipts Collection Fee and accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time shall be payable on a weekly basis on the weekly anniversary date of the Closing Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Closing Date and on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date (each a “PaymentDate”).  Any amount of principal or interest on the Revolving Loans which is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, shall at Lender’s option bear interest payable on demand at the Default Rate.







(d)   Revolving Loan Principal Repayments.







(i)        Mandatory Principal Repayments; Overadvances.   Following the collection of the Reserve Amount, a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of all amounts deposited into the Lock Box Account (in excess of any recurring fees owed under Section 2.2, fees owed to any custodian/back-up servicer, the Receipts Collection Fee, and interest owed under Sections 2.1(c) and 2.4) shall be held by the Lender and credited toward the outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans hereunder on any Payment Date (the “Mandatory Principal Repayment Amount”).   All Revolving  Loans hereunder shall be repaid by Borrower on or before the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, unless payable sooner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.   In the event the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans hereunder exceed the Revolving Loan Availability, Borrower shall, upon notice or demand from Lender, immediately make such repayments of the Revolving Loans or take such other actions as shall be necessary to eliminate such excess.















13


















(ii)       Optional Prepayments.   Borrower may from time to time prepay the Revolving Loan, in whole or in part, provided, however, that if the Borrower prepays more than eighty percent (80%) of the amount of the Revolving Loan Commitment within ninety one (91) to one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, Borrower shall pay to Lender as liquidated damages and compensation for the costs of being prepared to make funds available hereunder an amount equal to two and 50/100 percent (2.50%) of the outstanding Revolving  Loan  Commitment  (the  “Prepayment Penalty”)  except  in  the  case  of  an  Early Termination Notice.  Fees owed pursuant to this Section shall not be applicable with respect to the Mandatory Principal Repayment Amount made pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(i).







(e)   Collections; Lock Box.







(i)        To the extent any Customers make or pay any Receipts to the Credit Parties by a wire transfer, the Credit Parties shall direct all of such Customers to make all such wire transfer payments directly to the Lock Box Account.   To the extent any Customers make or pay any Receipts to the Credit Parties by any other form other than wire transfer (such as through a check), then each Credit Party shall direct all of its Customers to make all such payments and Receipts directly to a post office box designated by, and under the exclusive control of, Lender (such post office box is referred to herein as the “LockBox”). The parties recognize that in many instances, Customers of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries make payments to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries through the use of a credit or debit card.  In that regard, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall, prior to the Closing Date, modify its agreements with all credit/debit card payment processing companies with whom it has agreements or other payment processing relationships (the “PaymentProcessingCompanies”), so as to authorize, direct and cause: (A) all credit/debit card payments from any Customers; and (B) any reserves or holdbacks withheld by any of the Payment Processing Companies, if, as an when distributed or paid to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, to be deposited directly into the Lock Box Account, rather than any other bank accounts of the Credit Parties.  It shall be a condition precedent to the making of any Revolving Loans hereunder that each of the Payment Processing Companies issue and deliver to Lender an estoppel certificate, disbursement direction or other similar document confirming and agreeing: (I) to the foregoing payment directions; (II) that such payment instructions and directions shall not be changed, amended or terminated, except upon written notice from Lender; and (III) that copies of all statements, notices and other communications sent by any Payment Processing Companies to the Credit Parties, also be delivered to Lender. The Credit Parties hereby agree to undertake any and all required actions, execute any required documents, instruments or agreements, or to otherwise do any other thing required or requested by Lender in order to effectuate the foregoing.  Lender shall maintain an account at a financial institution acceptable to Lender in its sole and absolute discretion (the “LockBoxAccount”), which Lock Box Account is (as of the Closing Date) and shall be maintained in Lender’s name, and into which all Receipts, whether through wires, credit and debit card payments from any Customers (whether directly or through any Payment Processing Companies), and all other monies, checks, notes, drafts or other payments of any kind received by the Credit Parties shall be deposited, in the identical form in which such payments were received, whether by cash,













14


















check, direct deposit, or otherwise.  If the Credit Parties, any Affiliate, any shareholder, officer, director, employee or agent of the Credit Parties or any Affiliate, or any other Person acting for or in concert with the Credit Parties, shall receive any monies, checks, notes, drafts or other payments or Receipts, the Credit Parties and each such Person shall  receive all such items in trust for, and as the sole and exclusive property of, Lender, and, immediately upon receipt thereof, shall remit the same (or cause the same to be remitted) in kind to the Lock Box Account.  The Credit Parties and Lender agree that all payments made to such Lock Box Account, whether in respect  of  Receipts,  as  proceeds  of  other  collateral,  or  otherwise  (except  for  proceeds  of Collateral which are required to be delivered to the holder of a Permitted Lien which is prior in right of payment), will be swept from the Lock Box Account to Lender on each Payment Date to be applied according to the following priorities: (1) to unpaid fees and expenses due hereunder including, without limitation, any recurring fees due pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof; (2) to any custodian/back-up servicer (if applicable); (3) to accrued but unpaid interest owed under Sections 2.1(c) and 2.4 hereof; (4) to any accrued but unpaid Receipts Collection Fee; (5) if at any time the Lender is not holding, in the Lock Box Account, an amount equal to at least the Reserve Amount, then twenty percent (20%) of all Receipts received into the Lock Box Account shall be withheld and applied by Lender to amounts required to establish the Reserve Amount, until the Reserve Amount is reached during the duration of this Agreement, as additional security for the Obligations; (6) to amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d), including, but not limited to, the Mandatory Principal Repayment Amount; (7) to amounts payable pursuant to 2.2(g) and (8) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to Lender (including any Reserve Amount then in the Lock Box Account), to reduce the outstanding Revolving Loan balance to zero (each of the foregoing payments, the “Lock Box Payments”).  The amount remaining following the payment of the  Lock  Box Payments on each Payment  Date shall be  referred to herein as the “Net Amount”.  The Credit Parties and the Lender agree that one hundred percent (100%) of the Net Amount will be transferred to Borrower from the Lock Box Account via wire transfer or electronic  funds  transfer  to  an  account  designated  by  the  Borrower  on  the  immediately subsequent Payment Date.   Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable fees, costs and expenses in connection  with  opening  and  maintaining  of  the  Lock  Box,  the  Lock  Box  Account,  or  of creating, administering or switching any payment accounts with any of the Payment Processing Companies.  All of such reasonable fees, costs and expenses, if not paid by Borrower within five (5) business days of Lender’s written request, may be paid by Lender and in such event all amounts paid by Lender shall constitute Obligations hereunder, shall be payable to Lender by Borrower upon demand, and, until paid, shall bear interest at the lowest rate then applicable to Loans hereunder.  It is intended that all Receipts, and all other checks, drafts, instruments and other items of payment or proceeds of Collateral at any time received, due or owing to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be deposited into the Lock Box Account, and if not deposited into the Lock Box Account, shall be remitted or endorsed by the applicable Credit Party to Lender to be deposited into the Lock Box Account, and, if that remittance or endorsement of any such item shall not be made for any reason, Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized to remit or endorse the same on the applicable Credit Party’s behalf.   For purpose of this Section, each Credit Party irrevocably hereby makes, constitutes and appoints Lender (and all Persons designated by Lender for that purpose) as each Credit Party’s true and lawful attorney and agent- in-fact: (A) to endorse the applicable Credit Party’s name upon said items of payment and/or proceeds of Collateral and upon any chattel paper, document, instrument, invoice or similar document or agreement relating to any Receipts of the Credit Parties; (B) to take control in any manner of any item of payment or proceeds thereof; (C) to have access to the applicable Credit Party’s operating accounts, through the Credit Party’s online banking system, or otherwise, to make remittances of any Receipts deposited therein into the Lock Box Account as required hereby; and (D) to have access to any lock box or postal box into which any of the Credit Party’s mail is deposited, and open and process all mail addressed to the Credit Parties and deposited therein.















15


















(ii)       Lender may, at any time and from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, whether before or after notification to any Customer  and  whether  before  or  after  the  maturity of  any of  the  Obligations:  (A) enforce collection of any of the Accounts of any Credit Party or other amounts owed to any Credit Party by suit or otherwise; (B) exercise all of the rights and remedies of any Credit Party with respect to proceedings brought to collect any Accounts or other amounts owed to the Credit Parties; (C) surrender, release or exchange all or any part of any Accounts or other amounts owed to any Credit Party, or compromise or extend or renew for any period (whether or not longer than the original period) any indebtedness thereunder; (D) sell or assign any Account of any Credit Party or other amount owed to the Credit Parties upon such terms, for such amount and at such time or times as Lender deems advisable; (E) prepare, file and sign any Credit Party’s name on any proof of claim in bankruptcy or other similar document against any Customer or other Person obligated to any Credit Party; and (F) do all other acts and things which are necessary, in Lender’s sole discretion, to fulfill any Credit Party’s obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to allow Lender to collect the Accounts or other amounts owed to any Credit Party.  In addition to any other provision hereof, Lender may at any time after the occurrence and during  the  continuance  of  an  Event  of  Default,  at  Borrower’s  expense,  notify  any  parties obligated on any of the Accounts to make payment directly to Lender of any amounts due or to become due thereunder.







(iii)     On a monthly basis, Lender shall deliver to Borrower an invoice and an account statement showing all Loans, charges and payments, which shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Borrower, unless Borrower notify Lender in writing, specifying any error therein, within thirty (30) days of the date such account statement is sent to Borrower and any such notice shall only constitute an objection to the items specifically identified.







2.2       Fees.





(a)       Asset  Monitoring  Fee.  Borrower  agrees  to  pay  to  Lender  an  asset monitoring fee (“Asset Monitoring Fee”) equal to One Thousand Five-Hundred and No/100 United States Dollars (US$1,500.00), which shall be due and payable on the Closing Date, and thereafter on the first day of each calendar quarter during the term of the Revolving Loan Facility.   The Asset Monitoring Fee shall be increased in increments of Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($500.00) each time the Revolving  Loan Commitment amount is increased pursuant to Section 2.1(b); provided that the Asset Monitoring Fee shall never exceed Two Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars (US$2,500.00).

(h)       Matters with Respect to Common Stock.





(i)        Issuance of Conversion Shares.   The parties hereto acknowledge that pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Notes and the Fee Notes, Lender has the right, at its discretion, to convert amounts due under the Revolving Notes or the Fee Notes into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Notes and the Fee Notes.  In the event, for any reason, the Borrower fails to issue, or cause the Transfer Agent to issue, any portion of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Revolving Notes or the Fee Notes (the “Conversion Shares”)  to  Lender  in  connection  with  the  exercise  by  Lender  of  any of  its conversion rights under the Revolving Notes, then the parties hereto acknowledge that Lender shall  irrevocably  be  entitled  to  deliver  to  the  Transfer  Agent,  on  behalf  of  itself  and  the Borrower,  a  “Conversion  Notice”  (as  defined  in  the  Revolving  Note  and  the  Fee  Note) requesting the issuance of the Conversion Shares then issuable in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Notes and the Fee Notes, and the Transfer Agent, provided they are the acting transfer agent for the Borrower at the time, shall, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Transfer Agent to, without any further confirmation or instructions from the Borrower, issue the Conversion Shares applicable to the Conversion Notice then being exercised, and surrender to a nationally recognized overnight courier for delivery to Lender at the address specified  in  the  Conversion  Notice,  a  certificate  of  the  Common  Stock  of  the  Borrower, registered in the name of Lender or its designee, for the number of Conversion Shares to which Lender shall be then entitled under the Revolving Notes or the Fee Notes, as set forth in the Conversion Notice.







(ii)       Issuance of Additional Common Stock.    In  the  event,  for  any reason, the Borrower fails to issue, or cause its Transfer Agent to issue, any portion of the Common Stock issuable to Lender under the Revolving Notes or the Fee Notes, either now or in the future, then the parties hereto acknowledge that Lender shall irrevocably be entitled to deliver  to  the  Transfer  Agent,  on  behalf  of  itself  and  the  Borrower,  a  written  instruction requesting the issuance of the shares of Common Stock then issuable, and the Transfer Agent, provided they are the acting transfer agent for the Borrower at the time, shall, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Transfer Agent to, without any further confirmation or  instructions  from  the  Borrower,  issue such  shares  of  the  Borrower’s  Common  Stock  as directed by Lender, and surrender to a nationally recognized overnight courier for delivery to Lender at the address specified in the Lender’s notice, a certificate of the Common Stock of the Borrower, registered in the name of Lender, for the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to Lender.















18


















(iii)     Removal of Restrictive Legends.  In the event that Lender has any shares of the Borrower’s Common Stock bearing any restrictive legends, and Lender, through its counsel or other representatives, submits to the Transfer Agent any such shares for the removal of the restrictive legends thereon, whether in connection with a sale of such shares pursuant to any exemption to the registration requirements under the Securities Act, or otherwise, and the Borrower and or its counsel refuses or fails for any reason to render an opinion of counsel or any other documents, certificates or instructions required for the removal of the restrictive legends, then:  (A)  to  the  extent  such  legends  could  be  lawfully  removed  under  applicable  laws, Borrower’s  failure  to  provide  the  required  opinion  of  counsel  or  any  other  documents, certificates  or  instructions  required  for  the  removal  of  the  restrictive  legends  shall  be  an immediate Event of Default under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents; and (B) the Borrower hereby agrees and acknowledges that Lender is hereby irrevocably and expressly authorized to have counsel to  Lender render any and  all opinions and other certificates or instruments which may be required for purposes of removing such restrictive legends, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Transfer Agent to, without any further confirmation or instructions from the Borrower, issue any such shares without restrictive legends as instructed by Lender, and surrender to a common carrier for overnight delivery to the address as  specified  by  Lender,  certificates,  registered  in  the  name  of  Lender  or  its  designees, representing the shares of Common Stock to which Lender is entitled, without any restrictive legends and otherwise freely transferable on the books and records of the Borrower.







(iv)      Authorized  Agent  of  the  Borrower.     The  Borrower  hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender and its counsel and its representatives, each as the Borrower’s duly authorized agent and attorney-in-fact for the Borrower for the purposes of authorizing and instructing the Transfer Agent to process issuances, transfers and legend removals upon instructions from Lender, or any counsel or representatives of Lender, as specifically contemplated herein.  The authorization and power of attorney granted hereby is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable so long as any Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents remain outstanding, and so long as the Lender owns or has the right to receive, any shares of the Borrower’s Common Stock hereunder, under the Revolving Notes or under the Fee Notes.  In this regard, the Borrower hereby confirms to the Transfer Agent and the Lender that it can NOT and will NOT give instructions, including stop orders or otherwise, inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement with regard to the matters contemplated herein, and that the Lender shall have the absolute right to provide a copy of this Agreement to the Transfer Agent as evidence of the Borrower’s irrevocable authority for Lender and Transfer Agent to process issuances, transfers and legend removals upon instructions from Lender, or any counsel or representatives of Lender, as specifically contemplated herein, without any further instructions, orders or confirmations from the Borrower.







(v)       Injunction and Specific Performance.   The Borrower specifically acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of any provision of this Section 2.2(h), the Lender will be irreparably damaged and that damages at law would be an inadequate remedy if this Agreement were not specifically enforced.  Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 2.2h) by the Borrower, the Lender shall be entitled to obtain, in addition to all other rights or remedies Lender may have, at law or in equity, an injunction restraining such breach, without being required to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security, and/or to a decree for specific performance of the provisions of this Section 2.2(h).















19


















2.3       Renewal of Revolving Loans; Non-Renewal of Revolving Loans; Fees.  On the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, so long as no Event of Default exists, and so long as no event has occurred that, with the passage of time, the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, Borrower shall have the option to request a renewal of the Revolving Loan Commitment and extension of the Revolving Loan Maturity Date for one (1) additional six (6) month  period.    To  make  such  request,  Borrower  shall  give  written  notice  to  Lender  of Borrower’s request to renew the Revolving Loan Commitment and extend the Revolving Loan Maturity Date for an additional six (6) month period on or before the Revolving Loan Maturity Date.  Lender may elect to accept or reject Borrower’s request for a renewal of the Revolving Loan Commitment and extension of the Revolving Loan Maturity Date in its sole and absolute discretion, which such acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld.  In the event Lender shall accept Borrower’s request for renewal and extension, Borrower shall, immediately upon demand from Lender and as a condition to the renewal and extension, deliver a renewal fee to Lender equal to two percent (2%) of the then outstanding Revolving Loan Commitment.







2.4       Interest and Fee Computation; Collection of Funds.   Interest accrued hereunder shall be payable as set forth in Section 2.1 hereof.   Except as otherwise set forth herein, all interest and fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days and shall be paid for the actual number of days elapsed.   Principal payments submitted in funds not immediately available shall continue to bear interest until collected.  If any payment to be made by Borrower hereunder or under the Revolving Notes shall become due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing any interest in respect of such payment.  Any Obligations which are not paid when due (subject to applicable grace periods) shall bear interest at the Default Rate.







2.5       Automatic Debit.    In  order  to  effectuate  the  timely  payment  of  any  of  the Obligations when due, Borrower hereby authorizes and directs Lender, at Lender’s option, to: (i) debit, or cause or instruct the debit of, the amount of the Obligations to any ordinary deposit account  of  Borrower;  or  (ii) make  a Revolving  Loan hereunder  to  pay the  amount  of  the Obligations.







2.6       Discretionary Disbursements.   Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, may immediately upon notice to Borrower, disburse any or all proceeds of the Revolving Loans made or available to Borrower pursuant to this Agreement to pay any fees, costs, expenses or other amounts required to be paid by Borrower hereunder and not so paid.  All monies so disbursed shall be a part of the Obligations, payable by Borrower on demand from Lender.







2.7       US Dollars; Currency Risk.  All Receipts will be in Dollars.  In the event Receipts are not in Dollars, Borrower shall bear the risk of Lender’s currency losses, and if Lender suffers a currency loss and the result is to increase the cost to Lender or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by Lender under this Agreement, under the Revolving Notes or under the Fee Notes with respect thereto, then after demand by Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth reasonably detailed calculations of the basis of such demand), Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender for such increased cost or such reduction.  Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to advance or cause an advance of Revolving Loans to pay for the increased costs or reductions associated with any such currency losses.

conversion must comply with Sections 2.2(a) or 2.2(b) hereof, as applicable; and (iv) failure by such Borrower to properly continue Eurodollar Revolving Loans at the end of an Interest Period shall be deemed a conversion to Base Rate Loans.


2.3 Funding of Revolving Loans.

Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly inform the Lenders as to the terms thereof. Each Lender will make its pro rata share of the Revolving Loans available to the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. on the date specified in the Notice of Borrowing by deposit (in U.S.
dollars) of immediately available funds at the offices of the Administrative Agent at its principal office in Charlotte, North Carolina, or at such other address as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing. All Revolving Loans shall be made
by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of each Lender’s Commitment Percentage.

No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make Loans hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to fulfill its obligations
hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the time of any such Loan that such Lender does not intend to make available to the
Administrative Agent its portion of the Loans to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Loans, and the Administrative Agent in
reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion without any obligation to do so) make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly
notify the relevant Borrower and such Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, interest on
such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per annum
rate equal to (a) from such Borrower at the applicable rate for such Loan pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (b) from a Lender at the Federal Funds Rate.

Each request for Revolving Loans shall be, in the case of Eurodollar Revolving Loans, in an aggregate principal amount that
is not less than the lesser of $10,000,000 or the remaining amount available to be borrowed and, in the case of Base Rate Loans, in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than the lesser of $5,000,000 or the remaining amount available to be
borrowed. Any Revolving Loan requested shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 unless the request is for all of the remaining amount available to be borrowed.

2.5 Reductions of Revolving Loan Commitment.

Upon at least three Business Days’ notice, Dominion Resources, on its own behalf and/or acting on
the request of any other Borrower, shall have the right to permanently terminate or reduce the aggregate unused amount of the Revolving Loan Commitment available to it and/or such other Borrower at any time or from time to time; provided that
(a) each partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount at least equal to $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 above such amount and (b) no reduction shall be made which would reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment to an

effect.

The date, amount, type, interest rate and duration of
Interest Period (if applicable) of each Loan made by each Lender to each Borrower, and each payment made on account of the principal thereof, shall be recorded by such Lender on its books; provided that the failure of such Lender to make any
such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of such Borrower to make a payment when due of any amount owing hereunder or under any Note in respect of the Loans to be evidenced by such Note, and each such recordation or
endorsement shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error.

applied as such Borrower may elect; provided that if such Borrower fails to specify the application of a voluntary prepayment then such prepayment shall be applied in each case first to Base Rate Loans of such Borrower and then to Eurodollar
Revolving Loans of such Borrower in direct order of Interest Period maturities.

(b) Mandatory Prepayments.

(i) If at any time the amount of Revolving Loans outstanding plus the aggregate amount of Competitive Bid Loans outstanding plus the aggregate amount of L/C Obligations exceeds the Revolving Loan Commitment, one or
more of the Borrowers shall immediately make a principal payment to the Administrative Agent in the manner and in an amount necessary to be in compliance with Section 2.1 hereof.

Credit Facility or any other credit facility of CNG, DRI or VaPower, whether now existing or otherwise established (other than the Existing VaPower Credit Facility), are increased from the aggregate commitments under such facilities as at the
Closing Date, the Revolving Loan Commitment will be automatically reduced hereunder in an amount equal to the aggregate dollar amount of such increased commitments under such other facilities, and one or more of the Borrowers shall make any related
principal payment to the Administrative Agent to reduce the Loans outstanding to be in compliance with clause (i) above.

(iii) Any payments made under this Section 3.2(b) shall be subject to Section 4.3 hereof and shall be applied first to Base Rate
Loans of the relevant Borrower, then to Eurodollar Revolving Loans of the relevant Borrower in direct order of Interest Period maturities, then to Competitive Bid Loans of the relevant Borrower pro rata among all Lenders holding same.



20








3.3 Payment in Full at Maturity.

On the Maturity Date, the entire outstanding principal balance of all Loans, together with accrued but unpaid interest and
all other sums owing under this Credit Agreement, shall be due and payable in full, unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 10 hereof.

3.4 Fees.

(a) Facility Fees.

(i) In consideration of the Revolving Loan Commitment being made available by the Lenders hereunder, DRI agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the pro rata benefit of each Lender, a per annum fee equal to the Applicable Percentage for Facility Fees multiplied by the Revolving Loan Commitment (the “Facility Fees”).

(ii) The accrued Facility Fees shall be due and payable in
arrears on each Fee Payment Date (as well as on any date that the Revolving Loan Commitment is reduced) for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter (or portion thereof), beginning with the first of such dates to occur after the Closing Date.


(b) Utilization Fees.

(i) If on any day the sum of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all Loans to the Borrowers plus the L/C Obligations then outstanding exceeds the product of (A) one-half (1/2) times (B) the Revolving Loan Commitment, each Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the pro rata benefit of each Lender, a per annum fee equal to the Applicable Percentage for Utilization Fees multiplied by such Borrower’s outstanding Loans plus the L/C Obligations then outstanding (the
“Utilization Fees”).

(ii) The
accrued Utilization Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date (as well as on any date that the Revolving Loan Commitment is reduced), beginning with the first of such dates to occur after the Closing Date.


(c) Administrative Fees. Dominion Resources agrees to
pay to the Administrative Agent an annual fee as agreed to between the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent.

3.5 Place and Manner of Payments.

All payments of principal, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts to be made by each Borrower under this Credit Agreement shall be received not later
than 2:00 p.m. on the date when due in U.S. dollars and in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction, counterclaim or withholding of any kind, by the Administrative Agent at its offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, except payments to
be made directly to the Issuing Lender as provided herein. Each Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Administrative Agent, the Loans, fees or other amounts payable by such Borrower hereunder to
which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails to specify, or if such



21









application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent, shall distribute such payment to the Lenders in such manner as it
reasonably determines in its sole discretion).

3.6 Pro Rata
Treatment.

Except to the extent otherwise provided herein,
all Revolving Loans, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loan, each payment of interest on the Revolving Loans, each payment of Facility Fees and Letter of Credit Fees, each reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitment, and each
conversion or continuation of any Revolving Loans, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective Commitment Percentages.

3.7 Computations of Interest and Fees.

(a) Except for Base Rate Loans, on which interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year as the case may
be, all computations of interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.

(b) It is the intent of the Lenders and each Borrower to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in
effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Borrowers are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral. In no
way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes
or otherwise, exceed the maximum non-usurious amount permissible under applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum non-usurious
amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such documents shall be automatically reduced to the maximum non-usurious amount permitted under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any
amendment or new document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum lawful amount, an amount equal
to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans of the relevant Borrower and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the relevant Borrower
or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans of the relevant. The right to demand payment of the Loans of any Borrower or any other indebtedness
evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such
demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or
extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum non-usurious amount permitted by applicable law.


22








3.8 Sharing of Payments.

Each Lender agrees that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Revolving Loan or L/C
Obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker’s lien, counterclaim or otherwise (including, but not limited to, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code) in excess of its pro rata
share as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans, in such amounts and with such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable in order that all
Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. Each Lender further agrees that if a payment to a Lender (which is obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of
set-off, banker’s lien, counterclaim or otherwise) shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of
that benefit to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation in Loans made to such Borrower may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise
all rights of payment, including set-off, banker’s lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the
date when such amount is due, such payments shall accrue interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is due until the day such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent or such other Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal
Funds Rate.

3.9 Evidence of Debt.

(a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan
made by such Lender to a Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender by or for the account of each Borrower from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each Lender will make
reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register for each Borrower pursuant to Section 12.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which
Registers and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from or for the account of the Borrowers and each Lender’s share thereof. The Administrative Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the
accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.

(c) The entries made in the accounts, Registers and subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.9 (and, if consistent
with the entries of the



23









Administrative Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of each Borrower therein recorded;
provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain any such account, such Registers or such subaccounts, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower
to repay the Loans made by such Lender to such Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof.

SECTION 4. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING LOANS

4.1 Eurodollar Loan Provisions.

(a) Unavailability. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall have determined in good faith (i) that U.S. dollar deposits in the principal amounts requested with respect to a Eurodollar Loan are not
generally available in the London interbank Eurodollar market or (ii) that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give notice of such determination
to the Borrowers and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination under clauses (i) or (ii) above, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
longer exist, (A) any request by a Borrower for Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be), and (B) any request by a Borrower for conversion into or
continuation of Eurodollar Revolving Loans shall be deemed to be a request for conversion into or continuation of Base Rate Loans.

(b) Change in Legality.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any
Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar
Loan, then, by written notice to the relevant Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

(A) declare that Eurodollar Loans, and conversions to or continuations of Eurodollar Loans, will not thereafter be made by such Lender to
such Borrower hereunder, whereupon any request by such Borrower for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Eurodollar Loans shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Base Rate Loans (or
Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

(B) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it to such Borrower be converted to Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate
Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be) in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be).


24








In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (A) or (B) above, all payments
and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender to such Borrower or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender to such Borrower shall instead be applied
to repay the Base Rate Loans (or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans, as the case may be) made by such Lender to such Borrower in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

(c) Increased Costs. If at any time a Lender shall incur increased
costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to the making, the commitment to make or the maintaining of any Eurodollar Loan because of (i) any change since the date of this Credit Agreement in any applicable
law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or such order) including, without limitation, the
imposition, modification or deemed applicability of any reserves, deposits or similar requirements (such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation
D to the extent included in the computation of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) or (ii) other circumstances affecting the London interbank Eurodollar market; then the relevant Borrower shall pay to such Lender promptly upon written demand
therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender may determine in its sole discretion) as may be required to compensate such Lender for such increased
costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder.

Each
determination and calculation made by a Lender under this Section 4.1 shall, absent manifest error, be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

4.2 Capital Adequacy.

If, after the date hereof, any Lender has determined that the adoption or effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital
adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender
(or its parent corporation) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
such Lender’s (or parent corporation’s) capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to any Borrower to a level below that which such Lender (or its parent corporation) could have achieved but for such
adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s (or parent corporation’s) policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from such Lender, the relevant Borrower shall pay to such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender (or its parent corporation) for such reduction. Each determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this Section 4.2 shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and
binding on the parties hereto.

4.3 Compensation.



25








Each Borrower shall compensate each Lender, upon its written request, for all reasonable losses, expenses
and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by the Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans to such Borrower) which such Lender
may sustain:

(a) if for any reason (other than a default by
such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a borrowing of Eurodollar Loans or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loans to such Borrower does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Competitive Bid Request to such Borrower, as the
case may be;

(b) if any repayment, continuation or conversion
of any Eurodollar Loan or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loan by such Borrower occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, including, without limitation, in connection with any demand, acceleration, mandatory
prepayment or otherwise (including any demand under this Section 4); or

(c) if such Borrower fails to repay its Eurodollar Loans or Absolute Rate Competitive Bid Loan when required by the terms of this Credit Agreement.

Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Section 4.3 shall be made as though the Lender has actually
funded its relevant Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of that Loan, having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the
transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of that Lender to a domestic office of that Lender in the United States of America; provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its Eurodollar Loans in any manner it
sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the calculation of amounts payable under this Section 4.3.

4.4 Taxes.

(a) Tax Liabilities Imposed on a Lender. Any and all payments by a Borrower hereunder or under any of the Credit Documents shall be made, in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding taxes measured
by net income and franchise taxes imposed on any Lender by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender is organized or transacting business or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, being hereinafter referred to as
“Taxes”). If such Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.4) such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such
deductions, (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iv) such Borrower shall deliver to such Lender evidence of such payment to the relevant
Governmental Authority.


26








(b) Other Taxes. In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay, upon notice from a Lender and prior to
the date when penalties attach thereto, all present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies of the United States or any state or political subdivision thereof or any applicable foreign
jurisdiction that arise from any payment made hereunder by such Borrower or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise from such Borrower’s participation with respect to, this Credit Agreement (collectively, the
“Other Taxes”).

(c) Refunds. If a
Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a refund (or a refund in the form of a credit) (each, a “Refund”) from a Governmental Authority (as a result of any error in the
amount of Taxes or Other Taxes paid to such Governmental Authority or otherwise) of Taxes or Other Taxes which a Borrower has paid, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts, pursuant to this Section 4.4, it shall promptly
notify such Borrower of the availability of such Refund and shall, within 30 days after receipt of written notice by such Borrower, make a claim to such Governmental Authority for such Refund at such Borrower’s expense if, in the judgment of
such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), the making of such claim will not be otherwise disadvantageous to it; provided that nothing in this subsection (c) shall be construed to require any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to institute any administrative proceeding (other than the filing of a claim for any such Refund) or judicial proceeding to obtain such Refund.

If a Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives a Refund from a Governmental Authority (as a result of
any error in the amount of Taxes or Other Taxes paid to such Governmental Authority or otherwise) of any Taxes or Other Taxes which have been paid by a Borrower, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 4.4, it shall promptly pay to such Borrower the amount so received (but only to the extent of payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 4.4 with respect to Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such Refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including the net amount of taxes, if any, imposed on such Lender or the Administrative Agent with respect to such Refund) of such Lender or Administrative Agent, and without interest
(other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such Refund); provided, however, that such Borrower, upon the request of Lender or the Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such
Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such Refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained in this
Section 4.4(c) shall require any Lender or the Administrative Agent to make available any of its tax returns (or any other information that it deems to be confidential or proprietary).

(d) Foreign Lender. Each Lender (which, for purposes of this
Section 4.4, shall include any Affiliate of a Lender that makes any Eurodollar Loan pursuant to the terms of this Credit Agreement) that is not a “United States person” (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
shall submit to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or before the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Person that becomes a Lender after the Closing Date by assignment, promptly upon such assignment), two duly completed and signed copies of
(A) either (1) Form W-8BEN, or any applicable successor form, of the United States Internal Revenue Service entitling such Lender to a complete exemption from withholding on all



27









amounts to be received by such Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement and/or the Notes or (2) Form W-8ECI, or any applicable successor form, of the
United States Internal Revenue Service relating to all amounts to be received by such Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement and/or the Notes and, if applicable, (B) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-9 entitling such Lender to
receive a complete exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each such Lender shall, from time to time after submitting either such form, submit to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed
copies of such forms (or such successor forms or other documents as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may be (1) reasonably requested in writing by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent
and (2) appropriate under then current United States laws or regulations. Upon the reasonable request of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each Lender that has not provided the forms or other documents, as provided above, on the basis
of being a United States person shall submit to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a “United States person.”

4.5 Mitigation; Mandatory Assignment.

The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall use reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate any increased cost or suspension
of the availability of an interest rate under Sections 4.1 through 4.4 above to the greatest extent practicable (including transferring the Loans to another lending office or Affiliate of a Lender) unless, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent
or such Lender, such efforts would be likely to have an adverse effect upon it. In the event a Lender makes a request to a Borrower for additional payments in accordance with Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.4, then, provided that no Default or
Event of Default with respect to such Borrower has occurred and is continuing at such time, such Borrower may, at its own expense (such expense to include any transfer fee payable to the Administrative Agent under Section 12.3(b) and any
expense pursuant to Section 4 hereof) and in its sole discretion, require such Lender to transfer and assign in whole (but not in part), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 12.3(b)), all
of its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement to an Eligible Assignee which shall assume such assigned obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that
(a) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority and (b) the Borrowers or such Eligible Assignee shall have paid to the assigning Lender in immediately available
funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the portion of the Loans hereunder held by such assigning Lender and all other amounts owed to such assigning Lender hereunder, including amounts owed pursuant to Sections
4.1 through 4.4 hereof.

SECTION 5. LETTERS OF CREDIT


5.1 L/C Commitment. (a) As of the Closing
Date, the existing letters of credit set forth on Schedule 5.1 shall be deemed Letters of Credit hereunder. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in
Section 5.4(a), agrees to issue new letters of credit (“Letters of Credit”) for the account of the relevant Borrower on any Business Day from the Closing Date until the date that is ten Business Days prior to the Maturity Date in such
form as may be approved from time to time by the Issuing Lender; provided that the Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue any Letter



28









of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment, (ii) the aggregate amount of the
Utilized Revolving Commitments would be greater than the Revolving Loan Commitments or (iii) unless the applicable Issuing Lender shall otherwise consent hereto, the aggregate amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by WBNA or any
other Lender, each as Issuing Lender, would exceed 50% of the L/C Commitment. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars, (ii) have a face amount of at least $1,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed by the Issuing Lender) and
expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date; provided, that, if one or more Letters of Credit shall at any time have an
expiry date that is later than the Maturity Date, the relevant Borrower shall, not later than (i) five days preceding the Maturity Date, deposit in a cash collateral account established with the Administrative Agent, on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, an amount equal to the L/C Obligations with respect to such Letters of Credit, if the relevant Borrower’s senior unsecured long-term, non-credit enhanced debt rating in effect is at least BBB- as
published by S&P and is at least Baa3 as published by Moody’s or (ii) fifteen days preceding the Maturity Date, deposit in a cash collateral account established with the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the L/C Obligations with
respect to such Letters of Credit if the relevant Borrower’s senior unsecured long-term, non-credit enhanced debt rating in effect is lower than BBB- as published by S&P or is lower than Baa3 as published by Moody’s; provided,
further, that the obligations under this Section 5 in respect of such Letters of Credit of (i) the Borrowers shall survive the Maturity Date and shall remain in effect until no such Letters of Credit remain outstanding and
(ii) each Lender shall be reinstated, to the extent any such cash collateral, the application thereof or reimbursement in respect thereof is required to be returned to the Borrowers by the Issuing Bank after the Maturity Date. Amounts held in
such cash collateral account shall be held and applied by the Administrative Agent in the manner and for the purposes set forth in Section 10.2(c).

(b) The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender
or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law.

5.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letter of Credit. The Borrowers may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices
specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing
Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby
(but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating
thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender and the relevant Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the relevant
Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof. The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount
thereof).


29








5.3 Fees and Other Charges. (a) The Borrowers will pay a fee (“Letter of Credit
Fees”) on all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Percentage then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans, shared ratably among the Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date
after the issuance date. In addition, the relevant Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee on the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit as specified in the fee letter by and between DRI and WBNA
dated January 10, 2006, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.

(b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the relevant Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as
are incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit.

5.4 L/C Participations. (a) The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the
Issuing Lenders to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participant’s own
account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participant’s Commitment Percentage in the Issuing Lender’s obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing
Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the relevant Borrower in accordance
with the terms of this Credit Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender’s address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant’s Commitment Percentage of the
amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed.

(b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 5.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the
Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate
during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such
period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 5.4(a) is not made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date
such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the Adjusted Base Rate. A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to
any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(c) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro
rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 5.4(a), the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter



30









of Credit (whether directly from the Borrowers or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of
interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to
be returned by the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.

5.5 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrowers. The Borrowers agree to reimburse the Issuing Lender on the
Business Day next succeeding the Business Day on which the Issuing Lender notifies the relevant Borrower of the date and amount of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit and paid by the Issuing Lender for the amount of (a) such draft so
paid and (b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment. Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices referred to herein in Dollars and
in immediately available funds. Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until payment in full at the rate set forth in (i) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant
notice, Section 3.1(a)(i) and (ii) thereafter, Section 3.1(b).

5.6 Obligations Absolute. The Borrowers’ obligations under this Section 5 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or

and at any time thereafter unless and until such Event of Default has been waived by the Required Lenders or cured to the satisfaction of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may with the consent of the Required Lenders, and shall, upon
the request and direction of the Required Lenders, by written notice to such Borrower take any of the following actions without prejudice to the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to enforce its claims against such Borrower, except as

Borrower is CNG, then also to Dominion Resources) shall be immediately terminated.

(ii) Acceleration of Loans. Declare the unpaid principal of and any accrued interest in respect of all Loans made to such Borrower
(and, if such Borrower is CNG, then also to Dominion Resources) and any and all other indebtedness or obligations of any and every kind (including all amounts of L/C Obligations, whether or not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding Letters of
Credit shall have presented the documents required thereunder) owing by such Borrower (and, if such Borrower is CNG, then also by Dominion Resources) to any of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent hereunder to be due whereupon the same shall be
immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by such Borrower (and, if such Borrower is CNG, then also by Dominion Resources).

(iii) Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all
rights and interests created and existing under the Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all rights of set-off, as against such Borrower.

of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under the other Credit Documents. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon,

In carrying out the foregoing, (a) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding
category and (b) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on each Lender’s Commitment Percentages) of amounts available to be applied.

SECTION 11. AGENCY PROVISIONS

11.1 Appointment.

Each Lender hereby designates and appoints WBNA as administrative agent of such Lender to act as specified herein and the other Credit Documents, and each
such Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent, as the agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties
as are expressly delegated by the terms hereof and of the other Credit Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere herein and in the other Credit Documents,
the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and therein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, or shall otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent. The provisions of this Section are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and no Borrower shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as
agent of the Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of agency or trust with or for any Borrower.

11.2 Delegation of Duties.

The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties hereunder or under the other Credit Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall
be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.


11.3 Exculpatory Provisions.

Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection herewith or in connection with any of the other Credit Documents (except for its or
such Person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by a Borrower contained herein or in any of the other Credit
Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection herewith or in connection with the other Credit Documents, or enforceability or
sufficiency therefor of any of the other Credit Documents, or for any failure of the Borrowers to perform their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for the effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Credit Agreement, or any of the other Credit Documents or for any representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or made by a Borrower in any
written or oral statement or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports, certificates or any other documents in connection



47









herewith or therewith furnished or made by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders or by or on behalf of a Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
or be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained herein or therein or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or of the existence or possible
existence of any Default or Event of Default or to inspect the properties, books or records of a Borrower. The Administrative Agent is not a trustee for the Lenders and owes no fiduciary duty to the Lenders. None of the Lenders identified on the
facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as “Syndication Agent” or “Documentation Agent” shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders as such, nor shall they have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender.

11.4 Reliance on Communications.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to a Borrower, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent with reasonable care). The Administrative Agent
may deem and treat the Lenders as the owner of its interests hereunder for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent in accordance with
Section 12.3(b). The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Credit Agreement or under any of the other Credit Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders (or to the extent specifically provided in Section 12.6, all the Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be
incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents in accordance with
a request of the Required Lenders (or to the extent specifically provided in Section 12.6, all the Lenders) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders (including their
successors and assigns).

11.5 Notice of Default.


The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the relevant Borrower referring to the Credit Document, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be directed by the Required Lenders (or, to the extent specifically provided in Section 12.6, all the Lenders).

11.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders.


48








Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent or any affiliate thereof hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Borrower,
shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of a
Borrower and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Credit Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary
to inform itself as to the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of a Borrower. Except for (i) delivery of the Credit Documents and (ii) notices, reports and other documents
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, assets, property, financial or other conditions, prospects or creditworthiness of a Borrower which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates.

11.7 Indemnification.

Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as
such (to the extent not reimbursed by a Borrower and without limiting the obligation of a Borrower to do so), ratably according to its Revolving Loan Commitment, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including without limitation at any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out of this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. If any indemnity furnished to the Administrative Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the
Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished. The agreements in this
Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Credit Documents.

11.8 Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity.


49








The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue or participate in Letters of Credit
for the account of, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with a Borrower as though the Administrative Agent were not Administrative Agent hereunder. With respect to the Loans made by it, the Administrative Agent shall
have the same rights and powers under this Credit Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though they were not Administrative Agent, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” shall include the Administrative Agent in its
individual capacity.

11.9 Successor Administrative
Agent.

The Administrative Agent may, at any time, resign
upon 30 days written notice to the Lenders. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent shall select a successor Administrative Agent provided such successor is an Eligible Assignee (or if no Eligible
Assignee shall have been so appointed by the retiring Administrative Agent and shall have accepted such appointment, then the Lenders shall perform all obligations of the retiring Administrative Agent until such time, if any, as a successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment as provided for above). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor Administrative Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent, as
appropriate, under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the provisions of this Section 11.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Credit
Agreement.

respective parties at the address or telecopy numbers set forth on Schedule 12.1, or at such other address as such party may specify by written notice to the other parties hereto.

Notices and other communications to any Lender hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant
to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Section 2 unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. The Administrative Agent or a
Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to



50









it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular
notices or communications.

12.2 Right of Set-Off;
Adjustments.

In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default by a Borrower and the commencement of remedies described in Section 10.2, each Lender is authorized at any
time and from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind (all of which rights being hereby expressly waived), to set-off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other
indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender (including, without limitation branches, agencies or Affiliates of such Lender wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of such Borrower against obligations and liabilities of such
Borrower to the Lenders hereunder, under the Notes, the other Credit Documents or otherwise, irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall have made any demand hereunder and although such obligations, liabilities or claims,
or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured, and any such set-off shall be deemed to have been made immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default even though such charge is made or entered on the books of such Lender subsequent thereto.
Each Borrower hereby agrees that any Person purchasing a participation in the Loans and Commitments to it hereunder pursuant to Section 11.3(c) may exercise all rights of set-off with respect to its participation interest as fully as if such
Person were a Lender hereunder.

Except to the extent that this
Credit Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender, if any Lender (a “Benefitted Lender”) shall receive any payment of all or part of the obligations owing to it by a Borrower under this Credit
Agreement, receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 10.1(e), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment
to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of the obligations owing to such other Lender by such Borrower under this Credit Agreement, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating
interest in such portion of the obligations owing to each such other Lender, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits
of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the
purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

12.3 Benefit of Agreement.

(a) Generally. This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided that a Borrower may not assign and transfer any
of its interests (except as permitted by Section 8.2) without prior written consent of the Lenders; and provided further that the rights of each Lender to transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights and/or obligations hereunder shall
be limited as set forth in this Section 12.3.


51








(b) Assignments. Each Lender may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Loans, its Notes, and its Commitment); provided, however, that:

(i) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee;

(ii) each of (A) the Administrative Agent and (B) the Issuing Lenders, shall have provided their
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld);

(iii) DRI shall have provided its written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) which consent shall not be required during the existence of a Default or Event of Default;

(iv) any such partial assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to $5,000,000 (or, if less, the
remaining amount of the Commitment being assigned by such Lender) or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof;

(v) each such assignment by a Lender shall be of a constant, and not varying, percentage of all of its rights and obligations under this
Credit Agreement and the Notes; and

(vi) the
parties to such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance an Assignment Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit 12.3, together with a processing fee from the assignor of $4,000.

Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment Agreement, the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of such assignment, have the obligations, rights, and benefits of a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such assignment, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Credit Agreement. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this Section 12.3(b), the assignor, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that,
if required, new Notes are issued to the assignee. If the assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a State thereof, it shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption
from deduction or withholding of taxes in accordance with Section 4.4.

By executing and delivering an assignment agreement in accordance with this Section 12.3(b), the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and
the other parties hereto as follows: (A) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and the assignee warrants that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (B) except as set forth in clause (A) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Credit Agreement, any of
the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or the financial condition of a Borrower or the performance or



52









observance by such Borrower of any of its obligations under this Credit Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (C) such assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into such assignment agreement; (D) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Credit Agreement, the
other Credit Documents and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such assignment agreement; (E) such assignee will independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit
Agreement and the other Credit Documents; (F) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document as are delegated
to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (G) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms
of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Credit Agreement acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 12.3 concerning assignments relate only
to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including any pledge or assignment by a Lender to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable law.

(c) Register. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each
Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time by each Borrower
(collectively, the “Registers”). The entries in the Registers shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the relevant Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement. The Registers shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

(d) Acceptance. Upon its receipt of an
assignment agreement executed by the parties thereto, together with any Note subject to such assignment and payment of the processing fee, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment Agreement has been completed and is in substantially the
form of Exhibit 12.3, (i) accept such assignment agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the parties thereto.

(e) Participations. Each Lender may sell, transfer, grant or assign
participations in all or any part of such Lender’s interests and obligations hereunder; provided that (i) such selling Lender shall remain a “Lender” for all purposes under this Credit Agreement (such selling Lender’s
obligations under the Credit Documents remaining unchanged) and the participant shall not constitute a Lender hereunder, (ii) no such participant shall have, or be granted, rights to approve any amendment or waiver relating to this Credit
Agreement or the other Credit Documents except to the extent any such amendment or waiver would (A) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on or fees in respect of any Loans in which the participant is



53









participating, or (B) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal (including extension of the Maturity Date or the date of any mandatory
prepayment), interest or fees in respect of any Loans in which the participant is participating and (iii) sub-participations by the participant (except to an Affiliate, parent company or Affiliate of a parent company of the participant) shall
be permitted with the consent of the Borrowers (which, in each case, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be required during the existence of a Default or Event of Default). In the case of any such participation, the
participant shall not have any rights under this Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents (the participant’s rights against the selling Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the participation agreement with such
Lender creating such participation) and all amounts payable by such Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation; provided, however, that such participant shall be entitled to receive additional
amounts under Section 4 to the same extent that the Lender from which such participant acquired its participation would be entitled to the benefit of such cost protection provisions.

(f) Payments. No Eligible Assignee, participant or other transferee of any Lender’s rights shall be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 4 than such Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made with the relevant Borrower’s written consent.

(g) Nonrestricted Assignments. Notwithstanding any other provision set
forth in this Credit Agreement, any Lender may at any time assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A and any operating circular issued by such Federal
Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.

(h) Information. Any Lender may furnish any information concerning a Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Lender from time
to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants) who is notified of the confidential nature of the information and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to keep confidential all non-public information from
time to time supplied to it.

12.4 No Waiver; Remedies
Cumulative.

No failure or delay on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between a Borrower and the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The
rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on a Borrower in any case shall entitle such Borrower to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

12.5 Payment of Expenses, etc.


54








Each Borrower agrees to: (a) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of (i) the
Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery and administration of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to therein (including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of outside legal counsel to the Administrative Agent) and any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto and thereto including, but not limited to, any such amendments, waivers or consents resulting

claims, damages or expenses incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way related to, or by reason of, any investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender or its
Affiliates is a party thereto) related to the entering into and/or performance of any Credit Document or the use of proceeds of any Loans (including other extensions of credit) hereunder or the consummation of any other transactions contemplated in
any Credit Document by such Borrower, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding (but excluding any such losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Person to be indemnified).

12.6 Amendments, Waivers and Consents.

Neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any of the terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination is in writing and signed by the Required Lenders and the Borrowers; provided that no such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination shall without the consent
of each Lender affected thereby:

(b) reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest

(c) reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation;

(d) increase or extend the Commitment of a Lender over the amount thereof in effect (it being understood and agreed that a

55








(e) release a Borrower from its obligations under the Credit Documents or consent to the transfer or
assignment of such obligations;

(f) amend, modify or waive any
provision of this Section or Section 3.6, 3.8, 10.1(a), 11.7, 12.2, 12.3 or 12.5;

(g) reduce any percentage specified in, or otherwise modify, the definition of Required Lenders; or

(h) release all or substantially all of any cash collateral while any Letters of Credit or Reimbursement Obligations remain outstanding.

Notwithstanding the above, no provisions of Section 11 may be amended or
modified without the consent of the Administrative Agent and no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lenders without the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent or the Issuing Lenders, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is required in certain circumstances as set forth above, each Lender is entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any reorganization plan that affects the Loans and each Lender
acknowledges that the provisions of Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersede the unanimous consent provisions set forth herein.

shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Credit Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. Delivery of executed counterparts by facsimile shall be effective as an
original and shall constitute a representation that an original will be delivered.

the Required Lenders or to object to any matter requiring the consent of all the Lenders; provided, however, that all other benefits and obligations under the Credit Documents shall apply to such Defaulting Lender.

12.14 Entirety.

12.16 Submission to Jurisdiction.

Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Credit Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Credit Agreement shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Credit Agreement against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Credit Agreement in any court referred to above. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. Each of the Borrowers also hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal
action or proceeding referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

12.17 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees to keep confidential all non-public information provided to it
by any Borrower pursuant to this Agreement that is designated by such Borrower as confidential; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from disclosing any such information (a) to the Administrative
Agent, any other Lender or any of its Affiliates, (b) subject to an agreement to comply with the provisions of this Section, to any actual or prospective Assignee or participant, (c) to its employees, directors, agents, attorneys and
accountants or those of any of its affiliates, (d) upon the request or demand of any Governmental Authority, (e) in response to any order of any court or other Governmental Authority or as may otherwise be required pursuant to any
requirement of law, (f) if required to do so in connection with any litigation or similar proceeding, (g) that has been publicly disclosed, (h) to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization or any
nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued with respect to such Lender, or (i) in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or
under any other Credit Document.

12.18 Designation of
SPVs.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Lender, (a “Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPV”), identified as such in writing from time to time by such Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrowers, the option to fund all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Credit Agreement; provided that (i) nothing



58









herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or
any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof, (iii) no SPV shall have any voting rights pursuant to Section 12.6 and (iv) with respect to notices, payments and other
matters hereunder, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be obligated to deal with an SPV, but may limit their communications and other dealings relevant to such SPV to the applicable Granting Lender. The funding of a
Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Revolving Loan Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent that, and as if, such Loan were funded by such Granting Lender.

As to any Loans or portion thereof made by it, each SPV shall have all the rights that its applicable Granting Lender making
such Loans or portion thereof would have had under this Credit Agreement; provided, however, that each SPV shall have granted to its Granting Lender an irrevocable power of attorney, to deliver and receive all communications and notices under
this Agreement (and any related documents) and to exercise on such SPV’s behalf, all of such SPV’s voting rights under this Credit Agreement. No additional Note shall be required to evidence the Loans or portion thereof made by an SPV; and
the related Granting Lender shall be deemed to hold its Note as agent for such SPV to the extent of the Loans or portion thereof funded by such SPV. In addition, any payments for the account of any SPV shall be paid to its Granting Lender as agent
for such SPV.

Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV
shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreements shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness
of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.


In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Credit Agreement, any SPV may (i) at any time and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign or participate all or a portion of its interest in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions
providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency,
commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such SPV. This Section 12.17 may not be amended without the written consent of any Granting Lender affected thereby.

12.19 USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies each Borrower
that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001) (the “Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which
information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in accordance with the Act.

ARTICLE 2. THE CREDITS

Section 2.1. THE REVOLVING CREDIT. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof and so long as there is no Default, the Bank will make Revolving Credit
Advances to the Borrower, from time to time, until the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, as requested by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.2;
provided that the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Advances at
any time outstanding hereunder shall not exceed the Maximum Revolving Credit
Amount. The Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Bank the Revolving Credit
Note to evidence the Revolving Credit Advances. Subject to the foregoing
limitations and the provisions of Section 4.1 below, the Borrower may borrow,
repay pursuant to Section 4.2 and reborrow Revolving Credit Advances hereunder
from the date of this Agreement to the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

Section 2.2. REQUESTS FOR REVOLVING CREDIT ADVANCES. Each Revolving
Credit Advance shall be made on notice given by the Borrower to the Bank not
later than 12:00 noon (Boston time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing (a
"Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER that if the Borrower
elects a LIBOR Pricing Option with respect to any Revolving Credit Advance in
accordance with Section 2.4 hereof, such Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing
shall be given by the Borrower contemporaneously with a Pricing Notice in the
manner and within the time specified in Section 2.4. Each such Notice of
Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be by telephone or telecopy, in each case
confirmed immediately in writing by the Borrower, specifying therein (a) the
requested date of such Revolving Credit Advance, and (b) the amount of such
Revolving Credit Advance (which must be a minimum of $250,000 in the case of
requests for Prime Rate Loans and $500,000 and increments of $100,000 in the
case of requests for LIBOR Rate Loans). The Borrower agrees to indemnify and
hold the Bank harmless for any action, including the making of any Revolving
Credit Advances hereunder, or loss or expense, taken or incurred by the Bank in
good faith reliance upon such telephone request. At the time of the initial
request for a Revolving Credit Advance made under this Section 2.2, the Borrower
shall have provided the Bank with a Compliance Certificate. The Borrower hereby
agrees (i) that the Bank shall be entitled to rely upon the Compliance
Certificate most recently

7
<PAGE>   12

delivered to the Bank until it is superseded by a more recent Compliance
Certificate, and (ii) that each request for a Revolving Credit Advance, whether
by telephone or in writing or otherwise, shall constitute a confirmation of the
representations and warranties contained in the most recent Compliance
Certificate then in the Bank's possession.

Section 2.3. INTEREST ON REVOLVING CREDIT ADVANCES. Subject to the
terms of Section 2.4 relating to LIBOR Pricing Options, the Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid balance of the Revolving Credit Advances from time to
time outstanding at a per annum rate equal to the Prime Rate. Interest on the
Revolving Credit Advances shall be payable monthly in arrears on the last day of
each month, commencing November 30, 1995 and continuing until all of the
Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Bank under the Revolving Credit Note shall
have been paid in full.

Section 2.4. ELECTION OF LIBOR PRICING OPTIONS. Subject to all the
terms and conditions hereof and so long as there exists no Default, the Borrower
may, by delivering a notice (a "Pricing Notice") to the Bank received at or
before 10:00 a.m. Boston time on the date two Business Days prior to the
commencement of the Interest Period selected in such Pricing Notice, elect to
have all or a portion of the outstanding Revolving Credit Advances, as the
Borrower may specify in such Pricing Notice, accrue and bear daily interest
during the Interest Period so selected at a per annum rate equal to the
Applicable LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such
election made with respect to the Revolving Credit Advances shall be in an
amount not less than $500,000 and in increments of $100,000; and PROVIDED
FURTHER that no such election will be made if it would result in there being
more than four (4) LIBOR Pricing Options in the aggregate outstanding at any one
time. Interest on Revolving Credit Advances bearing interest at the Applicable
LIBOR Rate shall be paid for the applicable Interest Period on the last day
thereof and when such LIBOR Rate Loan is due (whether at maturity, by reason of
acceleration or otherwise). Each Pricing Notice shall be substantially in the
form of EXHIBIT D attached hereto and shall specify: (i) the selection of a
LIBOR Pricing Option; (ii) the effective date and amount of Revolving Credit
Advances subject to such LIBOR Pricing Option, subject to the limitations set
forth herein; and (iii) the duration of the applicable Interest Period. Each
Pricing Notice shall be irrevocable.

Section 2.5. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS. During the continuance of any Event
of Default, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank additional interest on the unpaid
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Note and, to the extent permitted by
law, on any overdue installments of interest, at a rate per annum equal to the
stated interest applicable to the Revolving Credit Advances or Term Loan plus
2%.

Section 2.6. SET-OFF; COMPUTATION OF INTEREST; ETC. The Borrower hereby
authorizes and directs the Bank, without prior notice to the Borrower, to charge
the Borrower's deposit accounts with the Bank for all payments of principal and
interest on the Revolving Credit Note and for all other amounts due under
Sections 2.3, 2.5, 2.9, 2.11, 2.12, 4.1, 12 or 13.7 or any other provision
hereof or of any other Bank Agreement. Interest hereunder and under the
Revolving Credit Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the
number of days actually elapsed. Any increase or decrease in the interest rate
on the Revolving Credit Note resulting from a change in the Base Rate shall be
effective immediately from the date of such change. No interest payment or
interest rate charged hereunder shall exceed the maximum rate authorized

8
<PAGE>   13

from time to time by applicable law. If the due date for any payment of
principal is extended by operation of law, interest shall be payable for such
extended time. If any payment required by this Agreement becomes due on a day
that is not a Business Day such payment may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension shall be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment. The outstanding amount of the Revolving Credit
Advances as reflected on the Bank's records from time to time shall be
considered correct and binding on the Borrower (absent manifest error) unless
within 30 days after receipt of any notice by the Bank of such outstanding
amount, the Borrower notifies the Bank in writing to the contrary.

Section 2.7. COMMITMENT FEE. For the period commencing from February 1,
1996, through the Revolving Credit Termination Date, the Borrower shall pay to
the Bank a commitment fee of 3/8% per annum of the actual daily Unused Revolving
Credit Amount. The facility fee shall be payable in arrears on May 1, 1996 and
on the first day of each February, May, August and November thereafter.

Section 2.8. REDUCTION OF COMMITMENT BY THE BORROWER. The Borrower at
its option may, at any time and from time to time, irrevocably reduce in part
(in integral multiples of $1,000,000) the unused portion of the Maximum
Revolving Credit Amount on not less than five (5) Business Days' prior written
notice to the Bank. No such reduction may be reinstated by the Borrower.

Section 2.9. INCREASED COSTS, ETC.

(a) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if any
changes in present or future applicable law (which term "applicable law", as
used in this Agreement, includes statutes and rules and regulations thereunder
and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by any governmental or
other regulatory body or official charged with the administration or the
interpretation thereof and requests, directives, instructions and notices at any
time or from time to time heretofore or hereafter made upon or otherwise issued
to the Bank by any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority,
whether or not having the force of law), including without limitation any change
according to a prescribed schedule of increasing requirements, whether or not
known or in effect as of the date hereof, shall (i) subject the Bank to any tax,
levy, impost, duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature with
respect to this Agreement or the payment to the Bank of any amounts due to it
hereunder, or (ii) materially change the basis of taxation of payments to the
Bank of the principal of or the interest on the Revolving Credit Advances or any
other amounts payable to the Bank hereunder, or (iii) impose or increase or
render applicable any special or supplemental deposit or reserve or similar
requirements or assessment against assets held by, or deposits in or for the
account of, or any liabilities of, or loans by an office of the Bank in respect
of the transactions contemplated herein, or (iv) impose on the Bank any other
condition or requirement with respect to this Agreement or any Revolving Credit
Advance, and the result of any of the foregoing is (A) to increase the cost to
the Bank of making, funding or maintaining all or any part of the Revolving
Credit Advances or its commitment hereunder, or (B) to reduce the amount of
principal, interest or other amount payable to the Bank hereunder, or (C) to
require the Bank to make any payment or to forego any interest or other sum
payable hereunder, the amount of which payment or foregone interest or other sum
is calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed
received by the Bank from the Borrower hereunder, then, and in each such case
not otherwise provided for hereunder, the

9
<PAGE>   14

Borrower will upon demand made by the Bank promptly following the Bank's receipt
of notice pertaining to such matters accompanied by calculations thereof in
reasonable detail, pay to the Bank such additional amounts as will be sufficient
to compensate the Bank for such additional cost, reduction, payment or foregone
interest or other sum; provided that the foregoing provisions of this sentence
shall not apply in the case of any additional cost, reduction, payment or
foregone interest or other sum resulting from any taxes charged upon or by
reference to the overall net income, profits or gains of the Bank. In
determining the additional amounts payable hereunder, the Bank may use any
reasonable method of averaging, allocating or attributing such additional costs,
reductions, payments, foregone interest or other sums among its customers.

(b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, after
the date hereof, the Bank shall have determined that any present or future
applicable law, rule, regulation, guideline, directive or request (whether or
not having force of law), including without limitation any change according to a
prescribed schedule of increasing requirements, whether or not known or in
effect as of the date hereof, regarding capital requirements for banks or bank
holding companies generally, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by the Bank with any of the foregoing, either imposes a requirement upon the
Bank to allocate additional capital resources or increases the Bank's
requirement to allocate capital resources or the Bank's commitment to make, or
to the Bank's maintenance of, the Revolving Credit Advances hereunder, which has
or would have the effect of reducing the return on the Bank's capital to a level
below that which the Bank could have achieved (taking into consideration the
Bank's then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming full
utilization of the Bank's capital) but for such applicability, change,
interpretation, administration or compliance, by any amount deemed by the Bank
to be material, the Bank shall promptly after its determination of such
occurrence give notice thereof to the Borrower. The Borrower and the Bank shall
thereafter attempt to negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the compensation
payable hereunder which will adequately compensate the Bank for such reduction.
If the Borrower and the Bank are unable to agree to such adjustment within
thirty (30) days of the day on which the Borrower receives such notice, then
commencing on the date of such notice (but not earlier than the effective date
of any such applicability, change, interpretation, administration or
compliance), the fees payable hereunder shall increase by an amount which will,
in the Bank's reasonable determination, evidenced by calculations in reasonable
detail furnished to the Borrower, compensate the Bank for such reduction, the
Bank's determination of such amount to be conclusive and binding upon the
Borrower, absent manifest error. In determining such amount, the Bank may use
any reasonable methods of averaging, allocating or attributing such reduction
among its customers. The provisions of this Section 2.9 shall be applied to the
Borrower so as not to discriminate against the Borrower vis-a-vis other
customers of the Bank.

Section 2.10. USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of all Revolving Credit
Advances shall be used by the Borrower for working capital and general corporate
purposes. The Borrower will not, directly or indirectly, use any part of such
proceeds for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock within the
meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
or to extend credit to any Person for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any
such margin stock.

10

Section 2.11. CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES.  In the event that:

(a) on any date on which the Applicable LIBOR Rate would
otherwise be set the Bank shall have determined in good faith (which
determination shall be final and conclusive) that adequate and fair means do not
exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate, as applicable; or

(b) at any time the Bank shall have determined in good faith
(which determination shall be final and conclusive) that

(i)  the implementation of LIBOR Pricing Option has been
made impracticable or unlawful by (A) the occurrence of a contingency
that materially and adversely affects the London interbank market, or
(B) compliance by the Bank in good faith with any applicable law or
governmental regulation, guideline or order or interpretation or change
thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation
or administration thereof or with any request or directive of any such
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law); or

(ii) the LIBOR Rate shall no longer represent the
effective cost to the Bank for U.S. dollar deposits in the London
interbank market, as applicable for deposits in which they regularly
participate;

then, and in such event, the Bank shall forthwith so notify the Borrower
thereof. Until the Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise
to such notice no longer apply, the obligation of the Bank to allow election by
the Borrower of a LIBOR Pricing Option shall be suspended. If at the time the
Bank so notifies the Borrower, the Borrower has previously given the Bank a
Pricing Notice with respect to a LIBOR Pricing Option, but the LIBOR Pricing
Option requested therein has not yet gone into effect, such Pricing Notice shall
automatically be deemed to be withdrawn and be of no force or effect. Upon such
date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the
date such notice is given), the LIBOR Pricing Option with respect to all LIBOR
Rate Loans shall be terminated and the Borrower shall pay all interest due on
such LIBOR Rate Loans and any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section
4.4.

Section 2.12. CONVERSION TO TERM LOAN.

(a) At the Borrower's election, which may be exercised only
once upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Bank prior to
October 20, 1998 (the "Election Date"), the Borrower may elect to convert all or
a portion of the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances outstanding
(the "Converted Amount") on the Election Date (the "Term Loan Amount") to a term
loan (the "Term Loan"). Interest on the Term Loan shall accrue from the Election
Date at the Prime Rate, subject to the Borrower's right to have the Term Loan
bear interest at a fixed rate as provided in paragraph (b) below, and in either
case interest shall be payable monthly in arrears on the last day of each month,
commencing on the month immediately following the month of the Election Date.
The principal of the term loan shall be repaid in thirty-six equal monthly
installments in an amount equal to l/36 of the Term Loan Amount, payable monthly
on the last day of each month, commencing on the month immediately following the
month of the Election Date, with the outstanding principal balance and all
accrued and unpaid interest and other charges due no later than October 20, 2001
(the "Term Loan Maturity Date").

11
<PAGE>   16

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
so long as there exists no Default, from time to time on any Business Day from
and after the Revolving Credit Termination Date, the Borrower may request that
the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan bear interest at a fixed rate
through the Term Loan Maturity Date, and, if such financing is then available
and being offered to borrowers in the Bank's ordinary course of business, the
Bank shall promptly quote a proposed fixed rate to the Borrower. If the Borrower
accepts such proposed fixed rate at the time it is offered, the interest rate on
the Term Loan shall accrue at such fixed rate from such date through the Term
Loan Maturity Date, and the Borrower, at the request of the Bank, shall execute
and deliver such confirmation thereof, including a revised note reflecting such
change, as requested by the Bank. If the Borrower does not accept such proposed
fixed rate at the time it is offered, the offer shall be deemed to be rejected,
but the Borrower may thereafter request further fixed rate quotations in
accordance with this Section 2.12(b).


ARTICLE 3. CONDITIONS OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT ADVANCES

<PAGE>   18

(a) The Borrower may make prepayments to the Bank of any
outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances or the Term Loan
equal to $250,000 or an integral multiple thereof which are Prime Rate Loans in
accordance with Section 4.2 at any time prior to 12:00 noon (Boston time) on any
Business Day without premium or penalty.

(b) The Borrower may not make prepayments to the Bank of any

Section 4.3. PAYMENT AND INTEREST CUTOFF. Notice of each prepayment
pursuant to Section 4.2(a) shall be given to the Bank in the case of prepayment
of Prime Rate Loans, not later than 12:00 noon (Boston time) on the date of
payment, and shall specify the total principal amount of the Revolving Credit
Advances to be paid on such date. Notice of prepayment having been given in
compliance with this Section 4.3, the amount specified to be prepaid shall
become due and payable on the date specified for prepayment and from and after
said date (unless the Borrower shall default in the payment thereof) interest
thereon shall cease to accrue. Unpaid interest on the principal amount of any
Revolving Credit Advances or the Term Loan so prepaid accrued to the date of
prepayment shall be due on the date of prepayment.

Section 4.4. PAYMENTS NOT AT END OF INTEREST PERIOD. If the Borrower
for any reason makes any payment of principal with respect to any LIBOR Rate
Loan on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable to
such LIBOR Rate Loan, including without limitation by reason of acceleration, or
fails to borrow a LIBOR Rate Loan after electing a LIBOR Pricing Option with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.4, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank, an
amount computed pursuant to the following formula:


L = (R - T) x P x D
360

L    =   amount payable to the Bank
R    =   the effective rate of interest on such LIBOR Rate Loan
T        = the effective interest rate per annum at which any readily
marketable bond or other obligation of the United States,
selected in the Bank's sole discretion, maturing on or near
the last day of the then applicable Interest Period of such
LIBOR Rate Loan and in approximately the same amount as such
LIBOR Rate Loan can be purchased by the Bank on the day of
such payment of principal or failure to borrow
P    =   the amount of principal prepaid or the amount of the requested
LIBOR Rate Loan
D    =   the number of days remaining in the Interest Period as of
the date of such payment or the number of days of the
requested Interest Period

Section 4.5. INDEMNIFICATION FOR LOSSES UPON PREPAYMENT OF FIXED RATE
TERM LOAN. If the Borrower shall at any time repay or prepay any principal of
the Term Loan which is bearing interest at a fixed rate on a date other than on
the scheduled date for payment thereof (as a consequence of acceleration
pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof, or otherwise), then the Borrower shall, on
demand made by the Bank at any time, pay to the Bank a sum (in this Section 4.5
called

14
<PAGE>   19

the "Reimbursable Cost") which shall be determined by the Bank in the following
manner after each such repayment or prepayment:

(a) FIRST, the Bank shall determine the amount by which:

(i) the total amount of interest which would have
otherwise accrued under the Term Loan on the principal so paid, during
the period (the "Reemployment Period") beginning on the date of such
payment and ending on the stated maturity of such principal;

shall exceed

(ii) the total amount of interest which would accrue,
during the Reemployment Period, on any readily marketable bond or other
obligation customarily issued by the United States designated by the
Bank in its sole discretion at or about the time of such payment (such
bond or other obligation of the United States to be in an amount equal
(as nearly as may be) to the amount of principal so paid and to have a
maturity comparable to the Reemployment Period, and the interest to
accrue thereon to take account of amortization of any discount from par
or accretion of premium above par at which the same is selling at the
time of designation).

(b) SECOND, the Bank shall divide such excess by the number of
interest payments which Acquisition would have been required to make during the
Reemployment Period, in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan in respect of
the principal so paid, with the resulting amount being hereinafter called an
"Installment Amount."

(c) THIRD, an Installment Amount shall be treated as payable
on each date on which interest would have been payable by the Borrower during
the Reemployment Period had the principal amount not been so paid.

(d) FOURTH, the amount to be paid on each such date shall be
the present value of an Installment Amount determined by discounting the amount
thereof from the date on which such Installment Amount is to be treated as
payable, at the same annual interest rate as that payable on the bond or other
obligation of the United States designated as aforesaid by the Bank.


ARTICLE 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Note and all other Bank Agreements and
other documents delivered or to be delivered by the Borrower or any Subsidiary
to the Bank, and the incurrence of Indebtedness to the Bank hereunder or
thereunder, now or hereafter owing,

(a) are within the corporate powers of the Borrower and each

Directors or other similar governing body, and, if required by law, by its
charter documents or by its By-Laws, by its stockholders;

(b) do not require any approval or consent of, or filing with,

and to the exercise of judicial discretion in accordance with general equitable
principles.

Section 5.7. OTHER AGREEMENTS. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is a party to any indenture, loan or credit agreement, or any lease or other
agreement or instrument, or subject to any charter or corporate restriction,
which is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, properties,

Subsidiary, or which restricts the ability of the Borrower or any Subsidiary to
carry out any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Note or
any of the Bank Agreements executed in connection herewith and therewith.

Section 5.8. PAYMENT OF TAXES. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
filed all tax returns which are required to be filed by them and have paid, or
made adequate provision for the payment of, all taxes which have or may become
due pursuant to said returns or to assessments received. All federal tax returns
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries through their fiscal year ended in 199_
have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service or are not subject to such
audit by virtue of the expiration of the applicable period of limitation, and
the results of such audits are fully reflected in the balance sheet contained in
the 1995 Financial Statements. The Borrower knows of no material additional

exhibits, memoranda or reports furnished to the Bank by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement

any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

Section 5.11. CHANGES IN CONDITION. Since the date of the balance sheet
contained in the 1995 Financial Statements, there has been no material adverse
change in the business or assets or in the condition, financial or otherwise, of
the Borrower or any Subsidiary, and neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has
entered into any transaction outside of the ordinary course of business which is

infringement of any license, patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, trade
name, trade secret or other intellectual property right of others. To the best
knowledge of the Borrower, there is no infringement or claim of infringement by
others of any material license, patent, copyright, service mark, trademark,
trade name, trade secret or other intellectual property right of Borrower and
its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.13. LITIGATION. There is no litigation, at law or in equity,
or any proceeding before any federal, state, provincial or municipal board or
other governmental or administrative agency pending or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower, threatened, or any basis therefor, which involves a material risk of
any judgment or liability which could result in any material adverse change in
the business or assets or in the condition, financial or otherwise, of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, and no judgment, decree, or order of any federal,
state, provincial or municipal court, board or other governmental or
administrative agency has been issued against the Borrower or any Subsidiary
which has or may have a material adverse effect on the business or assets or on
the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

Section 5.14. PENSION PLANS. No employee benefit plan established or
maintained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any other Person a member of the
same "control group," as the Borrower (a "Pension Affiliate"), within the

which the Borrower or any Subsidiary contributes) which is subject to Part 3 of
Subtitle B of Title I of the ERISA, had a material accumulated funding

18
<PAGE>   23

deficiency (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA) as of the last day

Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Borrower in an outstanding principal

to perform or observe any provision of any agreement or instrument relating to

or any Subsidiary in any court (i) for an amount in excess of 10% of the

30
<PAGE>   35

any Bank Agreement or any such instrument, and (unless there shall have occurred
an Event of Default under Section 10.1(f), in which case the unpaid balance of
Bank Obligations shall automatically become due and payable) may, by notice in
writing to the Borrower declare (a) its obligation to make Revolving Credit
Advances to be terminated, whereupon such obligation shall be terminated and (b)
declare all or any part of the unpaid balance of the Bank Obligations then
outstanding to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon such unpaid balance or
part thereof shall become so due and payable without presentation, protest or
further demand or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived.
In such event, the Bank may proceed to enforce payment of such balance or part
thereof in such manner as it may elect, and the Bank may offset and apply toward
the payment of such balance or part thereof any Indebtedness of it or any
Subsidiary to the Borrower, or to any obligor on the Bank Obligations, including
any Indebtedness represented by deposits in any general or special account
maintained with the Bank or with any other bank controlling, controlled by or
under common control with the Bank.


ARTICLE 11. WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS; REMEDIES

No delay or omission on the part of the Bank in exercising its rights
and remedies against the Borrower or any other interested party shall constitute
a waiver of any rights or remedies of the Bank. A breach by the Borrower of its
obligations under this Agreement may be waived only by a written waiver executed
by the Bank. The Bank's waiver of a breach by the Borrower in one or more
instances shall not constitute or otherwise be an implicit waiver of subsequent
breaches. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower hereby agrees
to waive, and does hereby absolutely and irrevocably waive (a) all presentments,
demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest
and notices of dishonor in connection with any of the Indebtedness evidenced by
the Revolving Credit Note, (b) any requirement of diligence or promptness on the
Bank's part in the enforcement of its rights under the provisions of this
Agreement or any Bank Agreement, and (c) any and all notices of every kind and
description which may be required to be given by any statute or rule of law with
respect to the Borrower's liability (i) under this Agreement or in respect of
the Indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving Credit Note or any other Bank
Obligation or (ii) under any other Bank Agreement. No course of dealing between
the Borrower and the Bank shall operate as a waiver of any of the Bank's rights
under this Agreement or any Bank Agreement or with respect to any of the Bank
Obligations. This Agreement shall be amended only by a written instrument
executed by the parties hereto making explicit reference to this Agreement. The
Bank's rights and remedies under this Agreement and under all subsequent
agreements between the Bank and the Borrower shall be cumulative and any rights
and remedies expressly set forth herein shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any other rights and remedies which may be available to the Bank
in law or at equity.


ARTICLE 12. INDEMNIFICATION

Without limitation of any other obligation or liability of the Borrower
or right or remedy of the Bank contained herein, the Borrower hereby covenants
and agrees to indemnify and hold the Bank, and the shareholders, directors,
agents, officers, partners, subsidiaries and affiliates of the Bank, harmless
from and against any and all damages, losses, settlement payments,

31
<PAGE>   36

obligations, liabilities, claims, including, without limitation, claims for
finder's or broker's fees, actions or causes of action, and reasonable costs and
expenses incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be paid by an indemnified
party in each case by reason of or resulting from any claim relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby other than any such claims which are determined
by a final, non-appealable order of a court to be the result of the Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Promptly upon receipt by any indemnified party
hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action against such indemnified
party for which a claim is to be made against the Borrower hereunder, such
indemnified party shall notify the Borrower in writing of the commencement
thereof, although the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the
indemnification rights of any such indemnified party hereunder. The Borrower
shall have the right, at its option upon notice to the indemnified parties, to
defend any such matter at its own expense and with its own counsel, except as
provided below, which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the indemnified
parties. The indemnified party shall cooperate with the Borrower in the defense
of such matter. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such matter at its own expense. In
the event that (a) the employment of separate counsel by an indemnified party
has been authorized in writing by the Borrower, (b) the Borrower has failed to
assume the defense of such matter or (c) the named parties to any such action
(including impleaded parties) include any indemnified party who has been advised
by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it or
prospective bases for liability against it, which are different from those
available to or against the Borrower, then the Borrower shall not have the right
to assume the defense of such matter with respect to such indemnified party. The
Borrower shall not be liable for any compromise or settlement of any such matter
effected without its written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably
delayed. The Borrower shall not compromise or settle any such matter against an
indemnified party without the written consent of the indemnified party, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.


ARTICLE 13. MISCELLANEOUS

Section 13.1. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

portion of such commitments, the Revolving Credit Note and its rights under any
other Bank Agreement, the assignee, transferee or recipient thereof shall have,

transferee, as the case may be, and in

Credit Agreement


Harris Trust and Savings Bank
Chicago, Illinois

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, JPS Packaging Company, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), applies to you (the "Bank") for your commitment, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof and on the basis of the representations and
warranties hereinafter set forth, to extend credit to the Company, all as more
fully hereinafter set forth.

Section 1.     The Credits.

Section 1.1.  Revolving Credit.  Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Bank agrees to extend a revolving credit (the "Revolving Credit") to
the Company which may be availed of by the Company from time to time during the
period from and including the date hereof to but not including the Termination
Date, at which time the commitment of the Bank to extend credit under the
Revolving Credit shall expire. The Revolving Credit may be utilized by the
Company in the form of Loans and Letters of Credit, all as more fully
hereinafter set forth, provided that the aggregate principal amount of Loans and
Letters of Credit outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the lesser of (i)
$15,000,000 (such amount as the same may be reduced pursuant hereto being
hereinafter referred to as the "Revolving Credit Commitment") and (ii) the
Available Borrowing Base as then determined and computed. During the period from
and including the date hereof to but not including the Termination Date, the
Company may use the Revolving Credit Commitment by borrowing, repaying and
reborrowing Loans in whole or in part and/or by having the Bank issue Letters of
Credit, having such Letters of Credit expire or otherwise terminate without
having been drawn upon or, if drawn upon, reimbursing the Bank for each such
drawing, and having the Bank issue new Letters of Credit, all in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, the Bank shall have the right from time to
time to establish reserves against the amount of Revolving Credit which the
Company may otherwise request hereunder in such amounts and with respect to such
matters as the Bank shall deem necessary or appropriate in its reasonable
judgment. The amount of such reserves shall be subtracted from the Borrowing
Base when calculating the amount of availability under the Revolving Credit
Commitment. Additionally, the Bank may from time to time reduce the percentages
applicable to Eligible Accounts and Eligible Inventory as they relate to the
Borrowing Base if the Bank determines in its reasonable judgment that there has
been a material adverse change in circumstances relating to any or all of such
Collateral from those circumstances in existence on the date of this Agreement
or in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company. The Bank agrees to
give the Company five (5) Business Days' prior notice of the establishment of
any such reserve or the reduction of any such percentage.

<PAGE>

Section 1.2.   Revolving Credit Loans.  Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Revolving Credit may be availed of by the Company in the form of
loans (individually a "Loan" and collectively the "Loans"). All Loans shall be
made against and evidenced by a single promissory note of the Company in the
form (with appropriate insertions) attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Revolving
Credit Note") payable to the order of the Bank in the principal amount of its
Revolving Credit Commitment. The Revolving Credit Note shall be dated the date
of issuance thereof, be expressed to bear interest as set forth in Section 2
hereof, and be expressed to mature on the Termination Date. Without regard to
the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Note stated on its face, the actual
principal amount at any time outstanding and owing by the Company on account of
the Revolving Credit Note shall be the sum of all Loans made hereunder less all
payments of principal actually received by the Bank.

Section 1.3.   Letters of Credit.  (a) General Terms.  Subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, the Revolving Credit may be availed of by the Company in
the form of standby and commercial letters of credit issued by the Bank for the
account of the Company (individually a "Letter of Credit" and collectively the
"Letters of Credit"), provided that the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit
issued and outstanding hereunder shall not at any one time exceed $1,500,000.
For purposes of this Agreement, a Letter of Credit shall be deemed outstanding
as of any time in an amount equal to the maximum amount which could be drawn
thereunder under any circumstances and over any period of time plus any
unreimbursed drawings then outstanding with respect thereto. If and to the
extent any Letter of Credit expires or otherwise terminates without having been
drawn upon, the availability under the Revolving Credit Commitment shall to such
extent be reinstated.

(b)  Term.  Each Letter of Credit issued hereunder shall expire not later
than the earlier of (i) twelve (12) months from the date of issuance (or be
cancelable not later than twelve (12) months from the date of issuance and each
renewal) or (ii) the Termination Date.

(c)  General Characteristics.  Each Letter of Credit issued hereunder shall
be payable in U.S. dollars, conform to the general requirements of the Bank for
the issuance of standby or commercial letters of credit, as the case may be, as
to form and substance, and be a letter of credit which the Bank may lawfully
issue.

(d)  Applications.  At the time the Company requests each Letter of Credit
to be issued (or prior to the first issuance of a Letter of Credit in the case
of a continuing application), the Company shall execute and deliver to the Bank
an application for such Letter of Credit in the form then customarily prescribed
by the Bank (individually an "Application" and collectively the "Applications").
Subject to the other provisions of this subsection, the obligation of the
Company to reimburse the Bank for drawings under a Letter of Credit shall be
governed by the Application for such Letter of Credit. Anything contained in the
Applications to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) in the event the Bank is not
reimbursed by the Company for the amount the Bank pays on any draft drawn under
a Letter of Credit issued hereunder by 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date
when such drawing is paid, the obligation of the Company to reimburse the Bank
for the amount of


<PAGE>

such draft paid shall bear interest (which the Company hereby promises to pay on
demand) from and after the date the draft is paid until payment in full thereof
at the rate per annum determined by adding 2% to the Domestic Rate as from time
to time in effect, (ii) the Company shall pay fees in connection with each
Letter of Credit as set forth in Section 2 hereof, (iii) except as otherwise
provided in Sections 3 and 4 hereof, prior to the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default the Bank will not call for additional collateral security for
the obligations of the Company under the Applications other than the collateral
security contemplated by this Agreement and the Collateral Documents and
collateral security consisting of rights in goods (or documents of title
evidencing the same) financed under such Applications, and (iv) except as
otherwise provided in Sections 3 and 4 hereof, prior to the occurrence of a
Default or an Event of Default the Bank will not call for the funding of a
Letter of Credit by the Company prior to being presented with a draft drawn
thereunder (or, in the event the draft is a time draft, prior to its due date).

Section 1.4.   Manner and Disbursement of Loans.  (a) The Company shall
give written or telephonic notice to the date Bank (which notice shall be
irrevocable once given) by no later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date
the Company requests the Bank to make a Loan hereunder. Each such notice shall
specify the date of the Loan requested (which must be a Business Day) and the
amount of such Loan. The Company agrees that the Bank may rely upon any written
or telephonic notice given by any person the Bank in good faith believes is an
Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent investigation.

(b)  The Company hereby irrevocably authorizes the Bank to make Loans from
time to time hereunder for payment of any Obligation then due and payable
(whether such Obligation is for interest then due on a Loan, reimbursement under
an Application or otherwise), and any such Loan may be made without regard to
the provisions of Section 7 hereof. The Company acknowledges and agrees,
however, that the Bank shall not be under any obligation to make a Loan under
this Section 1.4(b), and the Bank shall incur no liability to the Company or any
other Person for refusing to make a Loan under this Section 1.4(b).

(c)  Subject to the provisions of Section 7 hereof, the proceeds of each
Loan made under Section 1.4(a) hereof shall be made available to the Company at
the principal office of the Bank in Chicago, Illinois, in immediately available
funds, in the case of the initial Loan made hereunder, in accordance with the
terms of the written disbursement instructions of the Company, and, in the case
of each subsequent Loan, by deposit to the Company's general account with the
Bank known as Account Number 303-831-2. The proceeds of each Loan made under
Section 1.4(b) hereof shall be disbursed by the Bank by way of direct payment of
the relevant Obligation.

SECTION 2.     INTEREST, FEES, TERM AND TERMINATION.

Section 2.1.   Interest Rate Options. (a) Generally. Subject to all of the
terms and conditions of this Section 2, portions of the principal indebtedness
evidenced by the Revolving Credit Note (all of the indebtedness evidenced by the
Revolving Credit Note bearing interest at the same rate for the same period of
time being hereinafter referred to as


<PAGE>

a "Portion") may, at the option of the Company, bear interest with reference to
the Domestic Rate (the "Domestic Rate Portion") or with reference to an Adjusted
LIBOR ("LIBOR Portions") and Portions may be converted from time to time from
one basis to the other. All of the indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving
Credit Note which is not part of a LIBOR Portion shall constitute a single
Domestic Rate Portion. All of the indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving Credit
Note which bears interest with reference to a particular Adjusted LIBOR for a
particular Interest Period shall constitute a single LIBOR Portion. There shall
not be more than three (3) LIBOR Portions applicable to the Revolving Credit
Note outstanding at any one time. Anything contained herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the obligation of the Bank to create, continue or effect by
conversion any LIBOR Portion shall be conditioned upon the fact that at the time
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. The
Company hereby promises to pay interest on each Portion at the rates and times
specified in this Section 2.

(b)  Domestic Rate Portion. The Domestic Rate Portion shall bear interest
at the Domestic Rate as in effect from time to time, provided that if the
Domestic Rate Portion or any part thereof is not paid when due (whether by lapse
of time, acceleration or otherwise) such Portion shall bear interest, whether
before or after judgment, until payment in full thereof at the rate per annum
determined by adding 2% to the interest rate which would otherwise be applicable
thereto from time to time. Interest on the Domestic Rate Portion shall be
payable monthly in arrears on the first Business Day of each month in each year
(commencing August 1, 1998) and at maturity of the Revolving Credit Note and
interest after maturity (whether by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise)
shall be due and payable upon demand. Any change in the interest rate on the
Domestic Rate Portion resulting from a change in the Domestic Rate shall be
effective on the date of the relevant change in the Domestic Rate.

(c)  LIBOR Portions. Each LIBOR Portion shall bear interest for each
Interest Period selected therefor at a rate per annum determined by adding the
Applicable Margin to the Adjusted LIBOR for such Interest Period, provided that
if any LIBOR Portion is not paid when due (whether by lapse of time,
acceleration or otherwise) such Portion shall bear interest, whether before or
after judgment, until payment in full thereof through the end of the Interest
Period then applicable thereto at the rate per annum determined by adding 2% to
the interest rate which would otherwise be applicable thereto (provided that if
any Interest Period is longer than one month, then interest on the LIBOR Portion
having such Interest Period shall be due and payable on the date occurring each
month after the date such Interest Period began and on the last day of such
Interest Period), and effective at the end of such Interest Period such LIBOR
Portion shall automatically be converted into and added to the Domestic Rate
Portion and shall thereafter bear interest at the interest rate applicable to
the Domestic Rate Portion after default. Interest on each LIBOR Portion shall be
due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and
interest after maturity (whether by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise)
shall be due and payable upon demand. The Company shall notify the Bank on or
before 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the third Business Day preceding the end of
an Interest Period applicable to a LIBOR Portion whether such LIBOR Portion is
to continue as a LIBOR Portion, in which event the Company shall notify the Bank
of the new Interest Period selected therefor, and in the event the Company

<PAGE>

shall fail to so notify the Bank, such LIBOR Portion shall automatically be
converted into and added to the Domestic Rate Portion as of and on the last day
of such Interest Period.

Section 2.2. Minimum and Maximum Amounts. Each LIBOR Portion shall be in a
minimum amount of $500,000 or such greater amount which is an integral multiple
of $100,000.

Section 2.3. Manner of Rate Selection. The Company shall notify the Bank by
11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date
upon which the Company requests that any LIBOR Portion be created or that any
part of the Domestic Rate Portion be converted into a LIBOR Portion. If any
request is made to convert a LIBOR Portion into another type of Portion
available hereunder, such conversion shall only be made so as to become
effective as of the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. All
requests for the creation, continuance and conversion of Portions under this
Agreement shall be irrevocable. Such requests may be written or oral and the
Bank is hereby authorized to honor telephonic requests for creations,
continuances and conversions received by it from any person the Bank reasonably
believes to be an Authorized Representative without the need of independent
investigation, the Company hereby indemnifying the Bank from any liability or
loss ensuing from so acting.

Section 2.4. Change of Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement or the Revolving Credit Note, if at any time the Bank shall determine
in good faith that any change in applicable laws, treaties or regulations or in
the interpretation thereof makes it unlawful for the Bank to create or continue
to maintain any LIBOR Portion, it shall promptly so notify the Company and the
obligation of the Bank to create, continue or maintain any such LIBOR Portion
under this Agreement shall terminate until it is no longer unlawful for the Bank
to create, continue or maintain such LIBOR Portion. The Company, on demand,
shall, if the continued maintenance of any such LIBOR Portion is unlawful,
thereupon prepay the outstanding principal amount of the affected LIBOR Portion,
together with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts payable to the
Bank with respect thereto under this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Company may elect to convert the principal amount of the affected Portion into
another type of Portion available hereunder, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

Section 2.5. Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain Adjusted
LIBOR. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Revolving
Credit Note, if prior to the commencement of any Interest Period, the Bank shall
determine in good faith that deposits in the amount of any LIBOR Portion
scheduled to be outstanding during such Interest Period are not readily
available to the Bank in the relevant market or, by reason of circumstances
affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining Adjusted LIBOR, then the Bank shall promptly give notice thereof to
the Company and the obligations of the Bank to create such new LIBOR Portion,
continue such existing LIBOR Portion for a new Interest Period or effect such
new LIBOR Portion by conversion of the Domestic Rate Portion, as the case may
be, in such amount and for such Interest Period shall terminate until deposits
in such amount and for the Interest Period

<PAGE>

selected by the Company shall again be readily available in the relevant market
and adequate and reasonable means exist for ascertaining Adjusted LIBOR.

Section 2.6. Taxes and Increased Costs. With respect to any LIBOR Portion,
if the Bank shall determine in good faith that any change in any applicable law,
treaty, regulation or guideline (including, without limitation, Regulation D of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or any new law, treaty,
regulation or guideline, or any interpretation of any of the foregoing by any
governmental authority charged with the administration thereof or any central
bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority having jurisdiction over the
Bank or its lending branch or the LIBOR Portions contemplated by this Agreement
(whether or not having the force of law), shall:

(i)   impose, increase, or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or
for the account of, or loans by, or any other acquisition of funds or
disbursements by, the Bank which is not in any instance already accounted
for in computing the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Portion;

(ii)  subject the Bank, any LIBOR Portion or the Revolving Credit Note
to the extent it evidences such a Portion to any tax (including, without
limitation, any United States interest equalization tax or similar tax
however named applicable to the acquisition or holding of debt obligations
and any interest or penalties with respect thereto), duty, charge, stamp
tax, fee, deduction or withholding in respect of this Agreement, any LIBOR
Portion or the Revolving Credit Note to the extent it evidences such a
Portion, except such taxes as may be measured by the overall net income or
gross receipts of the Bank or its lending branches and imposed by the
jurisdiction, or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof, in
which the Bank's principal executive office or its lending branch is
located;

(iii) change the basis of taxation of payments of principal and
interest due from the Company to the Bank hereunder or under the Revolving
Credit Note to the extent it evidences any LIBOR Portion (other than by a
change in taxation of the overall net income or gross receipts of the
Bank); or

(iv)  impose on the Bank any penalty with respect to the foregoing or
any other condition regarding this Agreement, its disbursement, any LIBOR
Portion or the Revolving Credit Note to the extent it evidences any LIBOR
Portion;

and the Bank shall determine in good faith that the result of any of the
foregoing is to increase the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a
cost) to the Bank of creating or maintaining any LIBOR Portion hereunder or to
reduce the amount of principal or interest received or receivable by the Bank,
then the Company shall pay on demand to the Bank from time to time as specified
by the Bank such additional amounts as the Bank shall reasonably determine are
sufficient to compensate and indemnify it for such increased cost or reduced
amount. If the Bank makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to the
Company a certificate setting forth the computation of the increased cost or
reduced amount as a result

<PAGE>

of any event mentioned herein in reasonable detail and such certificate shall be
conclusive if reasonably determined.

Section 2.7.  Funding Indemnity. In the event the Bank shall incur any
loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any loss (including loss
of profit), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired or contracted to be acquired by
the Bank to fund or maintain any LIBOR Portion or the relending or reinvesting
of such deposits or other funds or amounts paid or prepaid to the Bank) as a
result of:

(i)  any payment of a LIBOR Portion on a date other than the last day
of the then applicable Interest Period for any reason, whether before or
after default, and whether or not such payment is required by any
provisions of this Agreement; or

(ii) any failure by the Company to create, borrow, continue or effect
by conversion a LIBOR Portion on the date specified in a notice given
pursuant to this Agreement;

then upon the demand of the Bank, the Company shall pay to the Bank such amount
as will reimburse the Bank for such loss, cost or expense. If the Bank requests
such a reimbursement, it shall provide to the Company a certificate setting
forth the computation of the loss, cost or expense giving rise to the request
for reimbursement in reasonable detail and such certificate shall be conclusive
if reasonably determined.

Section 2.8. Lending Branch. The Bank may, at its option (subject only to
Section 2.9 hereof), elect to make, fund or maintain Portions of the Loans
hereunder at such of its branches or offices as the Bank may from time to time
elect.

Section 2.9. Bank's Duty to Mitigate. The Bank agrees that, as promptly as
practicable after it becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the
existence of a condition that would cause it to be affected under Section 2.4,
2.5 or 2.6 hereof, the Bank will, to the extent not inconsistent with the Bank's
internal policies and customary business practices, use reasonable efforts to
make, fund or maintain the LIBOR Portions through another lending branch or
office of the Bank if as a result thereof the unlawfulness which would otherwise
require payment of such Loans pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof would cease to
exist or the circumstances which under Section 2.5 hereof would otherwise
terminate such Bank's obligation to make LIBOR Portions would cease to exist or
the increased costs or other compensation which would otherwise be required to
be paid in respect of LIBOR Portions pursuant to Sections 2.6 hereof would be
materially reduced, and if, as determined by the Bank, in its sole discretion,
the making, funding or maintaining of such Portions through such other lending
branch or office would not otherwise adversely affect such Portions or the Bank.
The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable expenses incurred by the Bank in
utilizing another lending branch or office of the Bank pursuant to this Section
2.9.

Section 2.9 hereof, but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Bank shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all
or any part of the Revolving Credit Note in any manner it sees fit, it being
understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations
hereunder (including, without limitation, determinations under Sections 2.5, 2.6
and 2.7 hereof) shall be made as if the Bank had actually funded and maintained
each LIBOR Portion during each Interest Period applicable thereto through the
purchase of deposits in the relevant market in the amount of such LIBOR Portion,

rate equal to the LIBOR for such Interest Period

Section 3.3.  Audit Fees. The Company shall pay to the Bank charges for
audits of the Collateral performed by the Bank or its agents or representatives
in such amounts as the Bank may from time to time request (the Bank
acknowledging and agreeing that such charges shall be computed in the same
manner as it at the time customarily uses for the assessment of charges for
similar collateral audits); provided, however, that in the absence of any
Default or Event of Default, the Company shall not be required to pay the Bank
for more than four (4) such audits per calendar year and shall not be required
to pay more than $500 per day per person conducting the audit, plus the Bank's
out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

the Obligations resulting from a change in the Domestic Rate shall be effective
on the date of the relevant change in the Domestic Rate.


<PAGE>

Section 3.6.  Change in Capital Adequacy Requirements. If the Bank shall
determine that the adoption after the date hereof of any applicable law, rule or
regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any existing law, rule
or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank (or any of
its branches) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether
or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on the Bank's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to extend
credit constituting a LIBOR Portion to a level below that which the Bank could
have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration the Bank's policies with respect to liquidity and capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by the Bank to be material, then from time to
time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by the Bank, the Company shall pay
to the Bank such additional amount or amounts reasonably determined by the Bank
as will compensate the Bank for such reduction.

Section 3.7.  Term and Termination. (a) Term. The term of the Revolving

through and including June 30, 2001, and the Revolving Credit Commitment shall
terminate on such date unless sooner terminated pursuant to this Section or as
otherwise provided in this Agreement. The Company may terminate the Revolving
Credit Commitment in whole (but not in part) at any time upon at least sixty

all outstanding Obligations (including, without limitation, the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Note), together with all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, (ii) the payment of any accrued and unpaid unused line
fees to the date of termination and (iii) the payment of any prepayment premium

termination of all Letters of Credit and, to the extent any such Letter of
Credit has not expired in accordance with its terms or otherwise been terminated
to the satisfaction of the Bank, accompanied by collateral security in form and
in such amounts as shall be satisfactory to the Bank. At the effective date of
any such termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment by the Company, the
Company shall pay a prepayment premium to the Bank, as liquidated damages for
the loss of bargain and not as a penalty, in an amount equal to $150,000 during
the initial term if termination occurs during the first 12-month period of the
initial term (the date hereof through and including June 30, 1999), and $75,000
at any time thereafter.

Section 3.8.  Place and Application of Payments and Collections. (a) All

the Bank may specify). All such payments shall be made in lawful money of the
United States of America, in immediately available funds at the place of
payment, without set-off or counterclaim and without reduction for, and free
from, any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
charges, deductions, withholdings, restrictions or conditions of any nature
imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof (but excluding any taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or
gross receipts of the Bank). Payments received by the Bank after 1:30

<PAGE>

p.m. (Chicago time) shall be deemed received as of the opening of business on
the next Business Day. Unless the Company otherwise directs, principal payments
on the Revolving Credit Note shall be applied first to the Domestic Rate Portion
of the Revolving Credit Note until payment in full thereof, with any balance
applied to the LIBOR Portions of the Revolving Credit Note in the order in which
their Interest Periods expire.

(b)  All payments made by the Company and all proceeds of Collateral shall,
upon receipt by the Bank, be applied by the Bank to the Obligations then due and
payable, with any balance of such proceeds not applied to the Obligations to be
held by the Bank as collateral security for the Obligations. Prior to the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, except as otherwise specifically
provided for herein, all payments made by the Company and all proceeds of
Collateral shall be applied by the Bank against the outstanding Obligations as
follows:

(i)   first, to any outstanding fees, charges and expenses then due
the Bank;

(ii)  second, to outstanding interest charges then due in respect of
the Obligations;

(iii) third, to the outstanding principal balance of the Loans and
reimbursement obligations in respect of drafts drawn under Letters of
Credit; and

(iv)  finally, to be applied to, or held as collateral security for,
any remaining unpaid or unsatisfied Obligations.

Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, the Company hereby
irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of payments and
collections at any time received by the Bank from or on behalf of the Company,
and the Company hereby irrevocably agrees that the Bank shall have the
continuing exclusive right to apply and reapply any and all such payments and
collections received at any time by the Bank against the Obligations in such
manner as the Bank may deem advisable.

(c)  The Company hereby irrevocably authorizes the Bank to charge any of
the Company's deposit accounts maintained with the Bank for the amounts from
time to time necessary to pay any then due Obligations; provided that the
Company acknowledges and agrees that the Bank shall be under no obligation to do
so and the Bank shall incur no liability to the Company or any other Person for
the Bank's failure to do so.

Section 3.9.  Voluntary Prepayments.

(a)  Domestic Rate Portion. The Company shall have the privilege of
voluntarily prepaying without premium or penalty and in whole or in part (but if
in part, then in an amount not less than $10,000) the Domestic Rate Portion of
the Revolving Credit Note at any time upon notice to the Bank prior to 11:00
a.m. (Chicago time) on the date fixed for prepayment.

<PAGE>

(b)  LIBOR Portions. The Company may voluntarily prepay any LIBOR Portion

Interest Period, in whole or in part (but if in part, then in an amount not less
than $500,000 or such greater amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000),
upon 3 Business Days' prior notice to the Bank (which notice shall be
irrevocable once given, must be received by the Bank no later than 11:00 a.m.
(Chicago time) on the third Business Day preceding the date of such prepayment,
and shall specify the principal amount to be repaid); provided, however, that
the outstanding principal amount of any LIBOR Portion of the Revolving Credit
Note prepaid in part shall not be less than $500,000 or such greater amount
which is an integral multiple of $100,000 after giving effect to such
prepayment. Any such prepayment shall be effected by payment of the principal
amount to be prepaid and accrued interest thereon to the end of the applicable
Interest Period.

Section 3.10.  Mandatory Prepayment. The Company covenants and agrees that
if at any time the sum of the then unpaid principal balance of the Loans plus
the then outstanding amount of Letters of Credit shall be in excess of the
Available Borrowing Base as then determined and computed, the Company shall
immediately and without notice or demand pay over the amount of the excess to
the Bank as and for a mandatory prepayment on such Obligations, with each such
prepayment first to be applied to the Loans until payment in full thereof with
any remaining balance to be held by the Bank as collateral security for the
Obligations owing under the Applications.

Section 3.11.  Computation of Obligations Outstanding. For the purpose of
calculating the aggregate principal balance of Obligations outstanding
hereunder, Obligations shall be deemed to be paid on the date payments or
collections, as the case may be, are applied by the Bank to such Obligations;
provided, however, for purposes of calculating interest payable by the Company
on the Loans and on any other interest-bearing Obligations under this Agreement,
any payment or collection, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be applied to
the Loans or other interest-bearing Obligations one (1) Business Day after
receipt of such payment or collection by the Bank. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any item presented for collection by the Bank is not honored, the
Bank may reverse any provisional credit which has been given for the item and
make appropriate adjustments to the amount of interest and principal otherwise
due hereunder.

Section 3.12.  Notations. Each Loan made against the Revolving Credit Note,
the status of all amounts evidenced by the Revolving Credit Note as constituting
part of the Domestic Rate Portion or a LIBOR Portion, and, in the case of any
LIBOR Portion, the rates of interest and Interest Periods applicable to such
Portion shall be recorded by the Bank on its books and records or, at its
option, recorded on a schedule to the Revolving Credit Note and the unpaid
principal balance and status, rates and Interest Periods so recorded or endorsed
by the Bank shall be prima facie evidence in any court or other proceeding
brought to enforce the Revolving Credit Note of the principal amount remaining
unpaid thereon, the status of the Loan or Loans evidenced thereby and the
interest rates and Interest Periods applicable thereto; provided that the
failure of the Bank to record any of the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise
affect the obligation of the Company to repay the principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Note together with accrued interest thereon. Prior

<PAGE>

to any negotiation of the Revolving Credit Note, the Bank shall record on a
schedule thereto the status of all amounts evidenced thereby as constituting
part of the Domestic Rate Portion or a LIBOR Portion and, in the case of any
LIBOR Portion, the rates of interest and the Interest Periods applicable
thereto.

shall at all times be secured by, among other things, (a) all of the Company's

Section 4.2.  Collateral Proceeds. The Company agrees to make such
arrangements as shall be necessary or appropriate to assure (through the use of
a lockbox under the sole control of the Bank) that all proceeds of the
Collateral are deposited (in the same form as received) in a remittance account
maintained with and under the control of the Bank, such account to constitute a
special restricted account. Any proceeds of Collateral received by the Company
shall be held by the Company in trust for the Bank in the same form in which
received, shall not be commingled with any assets of the Company, and shall be
delivered immediately to the Bank (together with any necessary endorsements
thereto) for deposit into such account. The Company acknowledges that the Bank
has (and is hereby granted to the extent it does not already have) a Lien on
such account and all funds contained therein to secure the Obligations. No
amounts deposited in such account shall be released to the Company, but shall
instead be applied to, or otherwise held as collateral security for, the
outstanding Obligations as set forth in Section 3 hereof, it being understood
and agreed that

the Company notwithstanding such application shall have the right to obtain
additional Revolving Credit under this Agreement subject to the terms and

the Bank in the Collateral.

1998, notwithstanding anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, the Company
shall not be deemed in default of the Ohio Mortgage if (a) the Company does not

Ohio Mortgage by virtue of the failure of the County of Summit, Ohio to transfer
to the Company the County's interest in such real property and (b) the County
has not disputed its obligation to make such transfer.

amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of
interest.

Section 10.2.  No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies. No delay or failure on the
part of the Bank in the exercise of any power or right shall operate as a waiver
thereof or as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other power or right. The rights and remedies hereunder of
the Bank are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which
it would otherwise have.

Section 10.3.  Amendments, Etc. No amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document, nor

to or demand on the Company in any case shall entitle the Company to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

Section 10.4.  Costs and Expenses; Environmental Indemnity. (a) The Company
agrees to pay on demand the costs and expenses of the Bank in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and the other instruments and documents to be delivered
thereunder, and in connection with the recording and filing of any of the
foregoing as well as in connection with lien searches from time to time obtained
by the Bank in its administration of the credit facilities provided for herein,
and in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and in
connection with any consents hereunder and any waivers or amendments hereto or
thereto, including the fees and expenses of Messrs. Chapman and Cutler, counsel
for the Bank, with respect to all of the foregoing (whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated). The Company further agrees to
pay to the Bank or any other holder of the Obligations all costs and expenses
(including court costs and attorneys' fees), if any, incurred or paid by the
Bank or any other holder of the Obligations in connection with any Default or
Event of Default or in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or any other instrument or document delivered thereunder.
The Company further agrees to indemnify the Bank, and any security trustee, and
their respective directors, officers and employees, against all losses, claims,
damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation therefor, whether or not

<PAGE>

which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to any Loan
Document or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or the direct or
indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any extension of
credit made available hereunder, other than those which arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the party claiming indemnification. The
Company, upon demand by the Bank at any time, shall reimburse the Bank for any
legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending
against any of the foregoing except if the same is directly due to the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified. The obligations
of the Company under this Section 10.4 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

(b)  The Company unconditionally agrees to forever indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and covenants not to sue for any claim for contribution against,
the Bank for any damages, costs, loss or expense, including without limitation,
response, remedial or removal costs, arising out of any of the following: (i)
any presence, release, threatened release or disposal of any hazardous or toxic
substance or petroleum by the Company or any Subsidiary or otherwise occurring
on or with respect to its property, (ii) the operation or violation of any
environmental law, whether federal, state, or local, and any regulations
promulgated thereunder, by the Company or any Subsidiary or otherwise occurring
on or with respect to its property, (iii) any claim for personal injury or
property damage in connection with the Company or any Subsidiary or otherwise
occurring on or with respect to its property, and (iv) the inaccuracy or breach
of any environmental representation, warranty or covenant by the Company or any
Subsidiary made herein or in any loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, deed
of trust, security agreement or any other instrument or document evidencing or
securing any indebtedness, obligations or liabilities of the Company owing to
the Bank or setting forth terms and conditions applicable thereto or otherwise
relating thereto, except for damages arising from the Bank's willful misconduct
or gross negligence. This indemnification shall survive the payment and
satisfaction of all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of the Company
owing to the Bank and the termination of this agreement, and shall remain in
force beyond the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations and payment
or satisfaction in full of any single claim under this indemnification. This
indemnification shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Company
and shall inure to the benefit of the Bank and its directors, officers,
employees, agents, and collateral trustees, and their successors and assigns.

Section 10.5.  Documentary Taxes. The Company agrees to pay on demand any
documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable in respect of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, including interest and penalties, in the event any such
taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such assessment is made and whether or
not any credit is then in use or available hereunder.

Section 10.6.  Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties made herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or in certificates

TENTH AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED

CREDIT AGREEMENT
THIS TENTH AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (this “Amendment”) dated as of October 26, 2012, is by and among Concho Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
“Borrower”), the Lenders party hereto (the “Lenders”) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”). Unless the context otherwise requires or
unless otherwise expressly defined herein, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement (as defined below).

WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders entered into that certain Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of July 31, 2008 (as amended, amended and restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”); and
WHEREAS, the
Borrower has requested that the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders amend the Credit Agreement in certain respects.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and confessed, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders hereby agree as follows:
SECTION 1. Amendments to Credit Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver in writing of each condition precedent set forth in Section 3 of this Amendment, and in reliance
on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Amendment, the Credit Agreement shall be amended effective as of the Tenth Amendment Effective Date (defined below) in the manner provided in this Section 1.

1.1 Senior Notes Adjustment. Section 3.05 of the Credit Agreement shall be and it hereby is amended in its
entirety to read as follows:
3.05 Senior Notes Adjustment. Unless otherwise
waived in writing by the Required Lenders, upon the incurrence of any Indebtedness under any Senior Notes permitted under Section 7.03(f) at any time and from time to time on and after November 2, 2013, the Borrowing Base and the
Conforming Borrowing Base then in effect shall each be reduced by the lesser of (i) $300 for every $1,000 in stated amount of such Indebtedness as of the date such Indebtedness is incurred and (ii) such other amount, if any, determined by
the Required Lenders in their sole discretion prior to issuance of such Senior Notes; provided that no such adjustment shall be required with respect to any Permitted Refinancing of any such Senior Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, the stated
amount of such Indebtedness that constitutes Permitted Refinancings of existing Senior Notes shall not be included for purposes of determining the reduction in the Borrowing Base and the Conforming Borrowing Base required by this
Section 3.05 and only the stated amount in excess of such Permitted Refinancings shall be included in calculating the adjustment required by this Section 3.05.

principal amount not to exceed $4,000,000,000 at any time outstanding (“Senior Notes”) and any Permitted Refinancing of any Indebtedness incurred under this clause (f); provided that (i) at the time of and immediately after
giving effect to each issuance of such Senior Notes or any Permitted Refinancing thereof, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) the final stated maturity date of such Senior Notes is not earlier than the first anniversary after
the Maturity Date (as in effect on the date of issuance of such Senior Notes), (iii) the non-default stated interest rate of such Senior Notes shall be consistent with market terms for issuers of similar size and credit quality at the time of
issuance, (iv) no scheduled principal amortization is required under such Senior Notes prior to the stated maturity of such Senior Notes and (v) such Senior Notes are evidenced by an indenture and related documents containing terms and

1.3 Dispositions. The initial clause of Section 7.05 of the Credit Agreement shall be and it hereby is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

next Redetermination of the Borrowing Base. The Borrowers and the Lenders agree that the Redetermination provided for in this Section 2 shall be the October 1, 2012 Scheduled Redetermination and shall not be construed or deemed to

action and require no approval, consent or action by or in respect of, or filing with, any court or agency of government.

TENTH
AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT – PAGE 3








and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent under any of the Loan Documents, nor,
except as expressly provided herein, constitute a waiver or amendment of any provision of any of the Loan Documents. Upon and after the execution of this Amendment by each of the parties hereto, each reference in the Credit Agreement to “this
Agreement”, “hereunder”, “hereof” or words of like import referring to the Credit Agreement, and each reference in the other Loan Documents to “the Credit Agreement”, “thereunder”, “thereof” or

the Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the
case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed. Computation of all other
types of interest and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360
days and the actual number of days elapsed, which results in a higher yield to
Lenders than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest shall accrue
on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a
Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is
paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made
shall bear interest for one day.

2.10     MAKING PAYMENTS.

(a)      Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments by Borrower
shall be made to Lender at Lender's Office not later than the Requisite Time for
such type of payment. All payments received after such Requisite Time shall be
deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day. All payments shall be made
in immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars. All payments by Borrower shall
be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment
or setoff.

(b)      Not used.

(c)      If any payment to be made by any Borrower Party shall come due
on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall instead be considered due on
the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected
in computing interest and fees.

2.11     FUNDING SOURCES. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
obligate Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or
manner or to constitute a representation by Lender that it has obtained or will
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.SECTION 3.

TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

3.01     TAXES.

(a)      Any and all payments by Borrower to or for the account of
Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of Lender, taxes
imposed on or measured by its net income or branch profits or franchise taxes
imposed on it (in lieu of net income or branch profits taxes), by the United
States of America or by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof)
under the Laws of which Lender is organized, in which its principal office is
located or in which it maintains a lending office, and any other taxes withheld
because Lender failed to timely


<PAGE>

deliver the forms required pursuant to Section 10.21 (all such non-excluded
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or
similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If
Borrower shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of
any sum payable under any Loan Document to Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), Lender
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) Borrower
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other
authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the
date of such payment, Borrower shall furnish Lender the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

(b)      In addition, Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes
or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan
Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter
referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c)      If Borrower shall be required by the Laws of any jurisdiction
outside the United States to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable under any Loan Document to Lender, Borrower shall also pay to Lender at
the time interest is paid, such additional amount that Lender specifies as
necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (after factoring in United States
(federal and state) taxes imposed on or measured by net income) Lender would
have received if such deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section) had not been made.

(d)      Borrower agrees to indemnify Lender for the full amount of
Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by
any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by Lender and any
liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto.

3.02     NOT USED.

3.03     NOT USED.

3.04     INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.(a) If any
change in or the interpretation of any Laws have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on the capital of Lender or compliance by Lender (or its Lending
Office) or any corporation controlling Lender as a consequence of Lender's
obligation hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy and Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time
upon demand of Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional amounts as
will compensate Lender for such reduction.

3.05     NOT USED.

3.06     MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION.

(a)      If Lender is claiming compensation under this Section 3,
Lender shall in each case furnish a certificate to Borrower that states in
reasonable detail in good faith the additional amount


<PAGE>

or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the basis therefor. Any such
certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of clearly demonstrable error. In
determining such amount, Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
methods.

3.07     SURVIVAL. All of Borrower's obligations under this Section 3
shall survive termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all
Obligations.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Each Borrower severally represents and warrants to Lender that:

5.01     ORGANIZATION AND EXISTENCE. Each Covered Person is duly
organized and existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization, is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
every jurisdiction where the nature or extent of its business or properties
require it to be qualified to do business, except where the failure to so
qualify will not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Covered Person has the
power and authority to own its properties and carry on its business as now being
conducted.

5.02     AUTHORIZATION. Each Borrower Party is duly authorized to
execute and perform every Loan Document to which such Borrower Party is a party,
and each Borrower is duly authorized to borrow hereunder, and the Loan Documents
to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate (or,
if not a corporation, comparable) action of Borrower Party. No consent, approval
or authorization of, or declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority,
and no consent of any other Person, is required in connection with any Borrower
Party's execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, except for those already duly obtained or explicitly contemplated
hereunder.

5.03     DUE EXECUTION. Every Loan Document to which a Borrower Party
is a party has been executed on behalf of such Borrower Party by a legally
competent Person duly authorized to do so.

5.04     ENFORCEABILITY OF OBLIGATIONS. Each of the Loan Documents to
which a Borrower Party is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Borrower Party, enforceable against such Borrower Party in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof
against such Borrower Party may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally
or by equitable principles of general application.

5.05     BURDENSOME OBLIGATIONS. No Covered Person is a party to or
bound by any Contract or is subject to any provision in the Charter Documents of
such Covered Person which would, if performed by such Covered Person, result in
a Default or Event of Default either immediately or upon the elapsing of time.

5.06     LEGAL RESTRAINTS. The execution of any Loan Document by a
Borrower Party will not violate or constitute a default under the Charter
Documents of such Borrower Party, any Material Agreement of such Borrower Party,
or any Material Law, and will not, except as expressly contemplated or permitted
in this Agreement, result in any Security Interest being imposed on any of such
Borrower Party's property. The performance by any Borrower Party of its
obligations under any Loan Document to which it is a party will not violate or
constitute a default under the Charter Documents of such Borrower Party, any
Material Agreement of such Borrower Party, or any Material Law, and will not,
except as expressly contemplated or permitted in this Agreement, result in any
Security Interest being imposed on any of such Borrower Party's property.

knowledge, threatened, strike, work stoppage, material unfair labor practice
claim or other material labor dispute against or affecting any Covered Person or

compliance with all Material Laws. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing:

(a)      GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. The operations and
employee compensation practices of every Covered Person comply in all material
respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, the failure to comply with
which is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b)      PROCEEDINGS. None of the operations of any Covered Person are
the subject of any judicial or administrative complaint, order or proceeding
alleging the violation of any applicable Environmental Laws.

(c)      INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. None of the
operations of any Covered Person are the subject of investigation by any
Governmental Authority regarding the improper transportation, storage, disposal,
generation or release into the environment of any Hazardous Material.

or report under any Environmental Law indicating a past or present spill or
release into the environment of any Hazardous Material from any property owned

four fiscal years of such Covered Person, or is required to be filed by any
Covered Person, to the extent such spill or release had or will have a Material
Adverse Effect.

to Company's knowledge, any other Person, has at any time transported, stored,

Effect. Company has no knowledge of any Hazardous Material on the surface, below
the surface, or within the boundaries of any real property owned or operated by
such Covered Person, which is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse

condition, results of operations and cash flows of Company as of the date and
for the periods stated therein.

been no change which is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.13     NO DEFAULTS. No Covered Person has breached or violated or has
defaulted under any Material Agreement, or has defaulted with respect to any
Material Obligation of such Covered Person. No Default or Event of Default
exists.

5.14.    TAX LIABILITIES; GOVERNMENTAL CHARGES. Each Covered Person has
filed or caused to be filed all tax reports and returns required to be filed by
it with any Governmental Authority, except where extensions have been properly
obtained or where failure to file is not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each Covered Person has paid or made adequate provision for
payment of all Taxes of such Covered Person, except (a) Taxes which are being
diligently contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which
such Covered Person has established adequate reserves in conformity with GAAP or
(b) where failure to pay is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No Security Interests for any such Taxes has been filed and no claims
are being asserted with respect to any such Taxes which, if adversely
determined, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are
no material unresolved issues concerning any liability of a Covered Person for
any Taxes which, if adversely determined, are reasonably like to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.15     PENSION BENEFIT PLANS. All Pension Benefit Plans maintained by
each Covered Person or an ERISA Affiliate of such Covered Person qualify under

claims, pending or threatened, involving any such Pension Benefit Plan by a
current or former employee (or beneficiary thereof) of such Covered Person or

anticipate any claims involving any such Pension Benefit Plan which would likely
be successfully maintained against such Covered Person or ERISA Affiliate of
such Covered Person.

Loans to and including the date of such application, third, to the payment of
the unpaid principal of the Loans, and fourth, to the payment of all other

10.04    BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT.

(a)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which a
Borrower Party is a party will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each
Borrower Party, Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that,
no Borrower Party may assign its rights hereunder or thereunder or any interest
herein or therein without the prior written consent of Lender and any such
attempted assignment shall be void. Lender may at any time pledge its Note or
any other instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under this Agreement to a
Federal Reserve Bank, but no such pledge shall release such Lender from its
obligations hereunder or grant to such Federal Reserve Bank the rights of a
Lender hereunder absent foreclosure of such pledge.

(b)      From time to time following the Closing Date, Lender may
assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of its Commitment
and/or Extensions of Credit; provided that (i) such assignment, if not to an
Affiliate of the Lender, shall be subject to the prior written consent of
Company at all times other than during the existence of a Default or Event of
Default (which approval of Company shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), (ii) a copy of a duly signed and completed endorsement and assignment
shall be executed, (iii) the effective date of any such assignment shall be as
specified in the endorsement and assignment and (iv) such assignee shall become
a "Creditor" under and as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement by executing
and delivering a counterpart thereof and complying with the provisions thereof.
Upon obtaining any consent required as set forth in the prior sentence and
payment of the requisite fee described below, the assignee named therein shall
be Lender for all purposes of this Agreement, and the assigning Lender shall be
released from its further obligations under this Agreement. Borrower agrees that
it shall execute and deliver upon request (against delivery by the assigning
Lender to Borrower of the Note) to such assignee Lender, the Note evidencing
such assignee Lender's Loans. For purposes hereof, each mutual fund that is an
Affiliate of Lender shall be deemed to be a single Eligible Assignee, whether or
not such fund is managed by the same fund manager as other mutual funds that are
Affiliates of the same Lender.

(c)      Lender may from time to time, without the consent of any other
Person, grant participations to one or more other Person all or any portion of
its Commitment and/or Extensions of Credit; provided, however, that (i) Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations, (iii) the participating banks or other financial institutions
shall not be a Lender hereunder for any purpose except, if the participation
agreement so provides, for the purposes of Section 3 (but only to the extent
that the cost of such benefits to Company does not exceed the cost which Company
would have incurred in respect of Lender absent the participation) and subject
to Sections 10.05 and 10.06, (iv) Borrower shall continue to deal solely and
directly with Lender in connection with Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, (v) the participation agreement shall not restrict an increase
in the combined Commitment or in granting


<PAGE>

Lender's Commitment, so long as the amount of the participation interest is not
increased, and (vi) the consent of the holder of such participation interest
shall not be required for amendments or waivers of provisions of the Loan
Documents; provided, however, that Lender may, in any agreement with a
participant, give such participant the right to consent to any matter which (A)
extends the Maturity Date as to such participant or any other date upon which
any payment of money is due to such participant, (B) reduces the rate of
interest owing to such participant, any fee or any other monetary amount owing
to such participant, or (C) reduces the amount of any installment of principal
owing to such participant. If Lender sells a participation to any Person that is
a "foreign corporation, partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code, it
shall include in its participation agreement with such Person a covenant by such
Person that such Person will comply with the provisions of Section 10.21 as if
such Person were a Lender and provide that Borrower shall be a third party
beneficiary of such covenant.

10.05    SET OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of Lender or
any assignee or participant of Lender or any Affiliate thereof (each a,
"Proceeding Party") provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, each Proceeding Party is authorized at any
time and from time to time, without prior notice to any Borrower Party, any such
notice being waived by Borrower Parties to the fullest extent permitted by law,
to proceed directly, by right of set off, banker's lien or otherwise, against
any assets of the Borrower Parties which may be in the hands of such Proceeding
Party (including all general or special, time or demand, provisional or other
deposits and other indebtedness owing by such Proceeding Party to or for the
credit or the account of Borrower) and apply such assets against the
Obligations, irrespective of whether such Proceeding Party shall have made any
demand therefor and although such Obligations may be unmatured. Lender agrees
promptly to notify Company after any such set-off and application made by
Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such set off and application.

10.06    NOT USED.

10.07    NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.

(a)      No failure by Lender to exercise, and no delay by Lender in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege under any Loan Document preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

(b)      The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein or therein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and
privileges provided by Law. Any decision by Lender not to require payment of any
interest (including Default Interest), fee, cost or other amount payable under
any Loan Document or to calculate any amount payable by a particular method on
any occasion shall in no way limit or be deemed a waiver of Lender's right to
require full payment thereof, or to calculate an amount payable by another
method that is not inconsistent with this Agreement, on any other or subsequent
occasion.

(c)      The terms and conditions of Section 9 are for the sole benefit
of Lender.


<PAGE>

10.08    USURY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan
Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted
by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If Lender shall receive interest in an
amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excessive interest shall be applied to
the principal of the Outstanding Obligations or, if it exceeds the unpaid
principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such
Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any
payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than
interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)
amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total
amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations.

10.09    COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

10.10    INTEGRATION. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Document is and any letter agreements referred to herein, comprises the complete
and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on the subject matter hereof.
In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those
of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control and
govern; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor
of Lender in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this
Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the
respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor
of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

10.11    NATURE OF LENDERS' OBLIGATIONS. Nothing contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and no action taken by Lender pursuant
hereto or thereto may, or may be deemed to, make Lender a partnership, an
association, a joint venture or other entity, either among themselves or with
Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower.

10.12    SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection
herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by Lender,
notwithstanding any investigation made by Lender or on its behalf.

10.13    INDEMNITY BY BORROWER.

(a)      Borrower agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless Lender
and its Affiliates, directors, officers, agents, attorneys and employees
(collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against: (i) any and all claims,
demands, actions or causes of action that are asserted against any Indemnitee by
any Person (other than Lender) relating directly or indirectly to a claim,
demand, action or cause of action that such Person asserts or may assert against
any Borrower Party, any of their Affiliates or any of their officers or
directors; (ii) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action (other
than by Lender) arising out of or relating to, the Loan Documents, any
predecessor loan documents, the Commitment, the use or contemplated use of the
proceeds of any Loan, or the relationship of any Borrower Party and Lender under
this Agreement; (iii) any administrative or investigative proceeding by any
Governmental Authority arising out of or related to a claim, demand, action or
cause of action described in subsection (i) or (ii) above; and (iv) any and all


<PAGE>

liabilities, losses, costs or expenses (including Attorney Costs) that any
Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of the assertion of any foregoing
claim, demand, action, cause of action or proceeding, or as a result of the
preparation of any defense in connection with any foregoing claim, demand,
action, cause of action or proceeding, in all cases, whether or not arising out
of the negligence of an Indemnitee, except as aforesaid, whether or not an
Indemnitee is a party to such clam, demand, action, cause of action or
proceeding (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities");
provided that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any loss
caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or for any loss
asserted against it by another Indemnitee. The foregoing indemnity shall not
extend to any indirect or consequential damages except to the extent such
damages are recoverable under a third-party claim against an Indemnitee. The
agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of all Obligations.

(b)      Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee of a notice of the
commencement of any action or proceeding that may give rise to indemnification
hereunder, such Indemnitee will notify Company. Company shall have the right to
undertake, conduct and control through counsel of its own choosing (which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitees) and at the sole
expense of Company, the conduct and settlement of any Indemnified Liabilities,
and the Indemnitees shall cooperate with Company in connection therewith;
provided that Company shall permit any Indemnitee to participate in such conduct
and settlement through counsel chosen by such Indemnitee, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the interests of Company and any Indemnitee become adverse in any
such claim or course of action, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
its own counsel, and the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
at Company's costs and expense. Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement
of any claim or action effected without its prior written consent, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld.

10.14    NONLIABILITY OF LENDERS. Borrower acknowledges and agrees
that:

(a)      Any inspections of any property of any Borrower Party made by
or through Lender are for purposes of administration of the Loan Documents only,
and Borrower is not entitled to rely upon the same (whether or not such
inspections are at the expense of Borrower);

(b)      By accepting or approving anything required to be observed,
performed, fulfilled or given to Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents, Lender
shall not be deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency, legality,
effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or
condition thereof, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not constitute
a warranty or representation to anyone with respect thereto by Lender;

(c)      The relationship between Borrower and Lender is, and shall at
all times remain, solely that of borrower and lender; Lender shall not under any
circumstance be deemed to be in a relationship of confidence or trust or a
fiduciary relationship with Borrower or its Affiliates, or to owe any fiduciary
duty to Borrower or its Affiliates; Lender does not undertake or assume any
responsibility or duty to Borrower or its Affiliates to select, review, inspect,
supervise, pass judgment upon or inform Borrower or its Affiliates of any matter
in connection with their property or the operations of Borrower or its
Affiliates; Borrower and its Affiliates shall rely entirely upon their own
judgment with respect to such matters; and any review, inspection, supervision,
exercise of judgment or supply of information undertaken or assumed by Lender in
connection with such matters is solely


<PAGE>

for the protection of Lender and neither Borrower nor any other Person is
entitled to rely thereon; and

(d)      Lender shall not be responsible or liable to any Person for
any loss, damage, liability or claim of any kind relating to injury or death to
Persons or damage to property caused by the actions, inaction or negligence of
Borrower and/or its Affiliates, and Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds Lender
and its Affiliates harmless from any such loss, damage, liability or claim
subject to the procedures and limitations governing indemnification under
Section 10.13.

10.15    NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED. This Agreement is made for the
purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties of
Borrower and Lender in connection with the Extensions of Credit, and is made for
the sole benefit of Borrower and Lender, and Lender's successors and assigns.
Except as provided in Sections 10.04 and 10.13, no other Person shall have any
rights of any nature hereunder or by reason hereof.

10.16    SEVERABILITY. Any provision of the Loan Documents that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

10.17    CONFIDENTIALITY. Lender shall use any confidential non-public
information concerning the Borrower Parties and their Subsidiaries that is
furnished to Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower Parties and their
Subsidiaries in connection with the Loan Documents (collectively, "Confidential
Information") solely for the purpose of evaluating and providing products and
services to them and administering and enforcing the Loan Documents, and it will
hold the Confidential Information in confidence. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lender may disclose Confidential Information (a) to its affiliates or any of its
affiliates' directors, officers, employees, auditors, counsel, advisors, or
representatives (collectively, the "Representatives") whom it determines need to
know such information for the purposes set forth in this Section; (b) to any
bank or financial institution or other entity to which Lender has assigned or
desires to assign an interest or participation in the Loan Documents or the
Obligations, provided that any such foregoing recipient of such Confidential
Information agrees to keep such Confidential Information confidential as
specified herein; (c) to any governmental agency or regulatory body having or
claiming to have authority to regulate or oversee any aspect of Lender's
business or that of its Representatives in connection with the exercise of such
authority or claimed authority ; (d) to the extent necessary or appropriate to
effect or preserve Lender's or any of its Affiliates' security (if any) for any
Obligation or to enforce any right or remedy or in connection with any claims
asserted by or against Lender or any of its Representatives; and (e) pursuant to
any subpoena or any similar legal process. For purposes hereof, the term
"Confidential Information" shall not include information that (x) is in Lender's
possession prior to its being provided by or on behalf of the Borrower Parties,
provided that such information is not known by Lender to be subject to another
confidentiality agreement with, or other legal or contractual obligation of
confidentiality to, a Borrower Party, (y) is or becomes publicly available
(other than through a breach hereof by Lender), or (z) becomes available to
Lender on a nonconfidential basis, provided that the source of such information
was not known by Lender to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other
legal or contractual obligation of confidentiality with respect to such
information.


<PAGE>

10.18    FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each Borrower Party shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, at their expense and without expense to Lender, do, execute
and deliver such further acts and documents as Lender from time to time
reasonably requires for the assuring and confirming unto Lender the rights
hereby created or intended now or hereafter so to be, or for carrying out the
intention or facilitating the performance of the terms of any Loan Document.

10.19    HEADINGS. Section headings in this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents are included for convenience of reference only and are not part
of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents for any other purpose.

10.20    TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence of the Loan
Documents

10.21    NOT USED.

10.22    COMPELLED RETURN OF PAYMENTS OR PROCEEDS. If Lender is for any
reason compelled to surrender any payment from Borrower because such payment is
for any reason invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, or determined to be
void or voidable as a preference, an impermissible setoff, or a diversion of
trust funds, then each Loan Document and the Obligations to which such payment
was applied or intended to be applied shall be revived with respect thereto as
if such application was never made; and Borrower shall be liable to pay to
Lender, and shall indemnify Lender for, and hold Lender harmless from, any loss
with respect to, the amount of such payment surrendered. This Section shall be
effective notwithstanding any contrary action Lender may take in reliance upon
its receipt of any such payment. Any such contrary action so taken by Lender
shall be without prejudice to Lender's rights under this Agreement and shall be
deemed to have been conditioned upon the application of such payment having
become final and indefeasible. The provisions of this Section shall survive
termination of the Commitment, the expiration of the Letters of Credit and the
payment and satisfaction of all Obligations.

10.23    GOVERNING LAW.

(a)      THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE
AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE; PROVIDED THAT LENDER SHALL
RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

BORROWER PARTY AND LENDER CONSENT, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO

LENDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING
OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION
IN RESPECT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO. EACH


<PAGE>

BORROWER PARTY AND EACH LENDER WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT
OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF
SUCH STATE.

10.24    WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH

CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT
OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT
A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR
A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

10.25    ORAL AGREEMENTS. ORAL AGREEMENTS OR COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY,
EXTEND CREDIT OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT INCLUDING

AGREEMENTS WE REACH COVERING SUCH MATTERS ARE CONTAINED IN THIS WRITING, WHICH,
TOGETHER WITH THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, IS THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE
AGREEMENT BETWEEN US, EXCEPT AS WE MAY LATER AGREE IN WRITING TO MODIFY IT.

entirety the Original Credit Agreement.

MASTER GUARANTY

This MASTER GUARANTY ("Guaranty"), dated as of March 12, 2004, is made
by each of the corporations from time to time party hereto (each, in its
capacity hereunder, a "Guarantor" and collectively "Guarantors"), jointly and
severally in favor of the Guarantied Parties referred to below with reference to
the following facts:

RECITALS

A.       Pursuant to that Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
as of March 12, 2004 among Insituform Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Company") and BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. ("Lender") (as amended, restated,
extended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time, the
"Credit Agreement") the Lender and its successors and assigns, (collectively,
the "Guarantied Parties") are making certain credit facilities available to
Borrower.

B.       As a condition to the availability of such credit facilities,
Guarantors are required to enter into this Master Guaranty and to guaranty the
Guarantied Obligations as hereinafter provided.

C.       Guarantors expect to realize direct and indirect benefits as
the result of the availability of the aforementioned credit facilities to
Borrowers, as the result of financial or business support which will be provided
to the Guarantors by Borrowers.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in order to induce the Guarantied Parties to extend the
aforementioned credit facilities, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which hereby are acknowledged, Guarantors hereby
covenant, agree and guaranty as follows:

1.       GENERAL. Unless the context of this Guaranty clearly requires
otherwise, (a) references to the plural include the singular and vice versa, (b)
references to any Person include such Person's successors and assigns but, if
applicable, only if such successors and assigns are permitted by this Guaranty,
(c) references to one gender include all genders, (d) "including" is not
limiting, (e) "or" has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase "and/or,"
(f) the words "hereof", "herein", "hereby", "hereunder" and similar terms in
this Guaranty refer to this Guaranty as a whole, including its Exhibits, and not
to any particular provision of this Guaranty, (g) the word "Section" or
"section" and "Page" or "page" refer to a section or page, respectively, of this
Guaranty unless it expressly refers to something else, (h) reference to any
agreement, document, or instrument, including this Guaranty, any other Loan
Document and any agreement, document or instrument defined herein, means such
agreement, document, or instrument as it may have been or may be amended,
restated, extended, renewed, replaced, or otherwise modified and in effect from
time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and, if applicable, the terms
hereof, and includes all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein, if any, and (i) general and specific references to any Law means such
Law as amended, modified, codified or reenacted, in whole or in

Form of Master Guaranty

D-1

<PAGE>

part, and in effect from time to time. Section captions are for convenience only
and do not affect the interpretation or construction of this Guaranty.

2.       DEFINITIONS. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings given them in the Credit Agreement.

3.       ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CAPACITY AS A COVERED PERSON UNDER THE
CREDIT AGREEMENT. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it has reviewed the Credit
Agreement and agrees that it is a "Covered Person" (as that term is defined in
the Credit Agreement and used in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents). All of the representations and warranties, covenants, and agreements
contained in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents which are
applicable to a Covered Person are incorporated into this Guaranty by this
reference and each Guarantor, as such a Covered Person, hereby makes such
representations and warranties to, and makes such covenants and agreements with,
the Guarantied Parties. Each Guarantor further acknowledges and agrees that the
failure of a Guarantor to comply with any terms of the Credit Agreement or the
other Loan Documents applicable to such Guarantor as a Covered Person will,
subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, result in a Default and/or Event
of Default under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, entitling
the Guarantied Parties to all of their remedies thereunder and under applicable
law and in equity.

4.       GUARANTY.

(a)      UNLIMITED GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE. Guarantors
hereby jointly and severally guaranty to the Guarantied Parties, for the benefit
of the Guarantied Parties, the full and prompt payment and performance of all
Obligations of Company, any Subsidiary Borrower and any other Borrower Party at
any time and from time to time owed to the Guarantied Parties under one or more
of the Loan Documents, whether due or to become due, matured or unmatured,
liquidated or unliquidated, or contingent or noncontingent, including
obligations of performance as well as obligations of payment, and including
interest that accrues after the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding by or against any Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person
(collectively, the "Guarantied Obligations"). Subject to Section 21, each
Guarantor understands and acknowledges that there is no limit on the Guarantied
Obligations.

(b)      CURRENCY OF PAYMENT. Payments hereunder in respect of any
Guarantied Obligations shall be made in Dollars.

(c)      NATURE OF GUARANTY. This is a continuing, absolute and
unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not merely of collection.
Each Guarantor's liability with respect to the Guarantied Obligations is
primary, not secondary. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and at any
time thereafter, the Guarantied Parties may proceed directly against any
Guarantor without first proceeding against any Borrower, any other Person liable
for the payment or performance of the Guarantied Obligations, or any collateral
or other security for the Guarantied Obligations. The Guarantied Parties will
not be required to mitigate damages or take any other action to reduce, collect
or enforce the Guarantied Obligations. Only upon Final Payment shall this
Guaranty be released, subject to being automatically reinstated as provided in
Section 7 herein.

(d)      PLACE FOR PERFORMANCE. All obligations of Guarantors under
this Guaranty are performable and payable at the Lending Office.

<PAGE>

5.       NO RELEASE OF GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor's liability under
this Guaranty will not be reduced, extinguished, discharged or released by, and
no Guarantor is entitled to raise as a defense, any:

(a)      invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the Guarantied
Obligations, any Borrower's Obligations or other obligations under the Loan
Documents to which it is a party, or of such Guarantor's obligations under the
Loan Documents to which it is a party, including this Guaranty;

(b)      existing or future offset, claim, counterclaim or defense of
any Borrower, such Guarantor or any other party against the Guarantied Parties
or against payment of the Obligations or the Guarantied Obligations (whether
such offset, claim, counterclaim or defense arises in connection with the
Obligations or the Guarantied Obligations or the transactions creating the
Obligations or the Guarantied Obligations or otherwise);

(c)      failure of such Guarantor to be given notice of a Default or
Event of Default by any Borrower;

(d)      waivers of Defaults or Events of Default or other waivers
under the Loan Documents;

(e)      extensions of due dates for payments, modifications of
interest rates or other payment terms with respect to the Guarantied Obligations
or any other accommodation, indulgence or forbearance granted to any Borrower;

(f)      reorganization, merger or consolidation of any Borrower or
such Guarantor into or with any other Person;

(g)      release of or non-perfection with respect to any or all of any
collateral or any other security for the Guarantied Obligations;

(h)      taking or accepting of any other security or collateral for,
or guaranty of, any or all of the Guarantied Obligations;

(i)      the death of or release of, or settlement or compromise with,
any one or more other Persons who have guarantied, or are otherwise liable for
the payment or performance of, any or all of the Guarantied Obligations;

(j)      assignment or other transfer of, or granting of a
participation in, any of the Guarantied Obligations or any collateral or other
security therefor, by the Guarantied Parties;

(k)      other acts or omissions which, in the absence of this Section
5 would operate so as to reduce, extinguish, discharge or release such
Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty (except for the full and indefeasible
payment of the Guarantied Obligations, cancellation or termination of the
Commitment, expiration of all Letters of Credit, and termination of any other
commitment to extend credit or make advances to or for the account of any
Borrower).

6.       WAIVERS.

Form of Master Guaranty

D-3

<PAGE>

(a)      NOTICE. Each Guarantor hereby waives notice of (i) acceptance
of this Guaranty, (ii) any amendment, restatement or other modification of any
of the Loan Documents (including modifications to interest rates or other
payment terms of the Guarantied Obligations), (iii) Extensions of Credit to any
Borrowers by the Guarantied Parties and fundings of Extensions of Credit to any
Borrower by the Guarantied Parties, (iv) the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default, (v) any matter referred to in Section 5 of this Guaranty, and (vi) any
other action at any time taken or omitted by the Guarantied Parties, and
generally, all demands and notices of every kind in connection with this
Guaranty and the Loan Documents, except as expressly provided herein and in the
Credit Agreement.

(b)      RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION, ETC. Each Guarantor hereby waives any
right of contribution, subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, or repayment, and
any other "claim", as that term is defined in the United States Bankruptcy Code,
which such Guarantor might now have or hereafter acquire against any Borrower or
any other Person liable for the payment or performance of the Obligations (other
than pursuant to this Guaranty) that arises from the existence or performance of
such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty; and such Guarantor waives the
right to participate in any existing or future collateral or other security for
the Guarantied Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that such Guarantor
will not enter into any agreement providing, directly or indirectly, for any
contribution, subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity or repayment by Borrowers on
account of any payment made by such Guarantor hereunder, and that any such
agreement would be void. Until payment in full of all Obligations and
termination of the Commitment, no Guarantor has any right of contribution,
subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity or repayment and no right of recourse to
or with respect to any assets or property of any other guarantor (including any
Guarantor) or other Person liable for any of the Guarantied Obligations (other
than pursuant to Section 20 below).

(c)      OTHER. Each Guarantor hereby waives (i) diligence,
presentment, demand for payment, protest or notice, whether of nonpayment,
dishonor, protest or otherwise, (ii) any and all claims, counterclaims or
defenses based upon, related to or arising out of (a) any matter referred to in
Section 5 of this Guaranty, (b) any issue as to whether any sale or other
disposition of any security for the Guarantied Obligations was conducted in a
commercially reasonable fashion, (c) any election of remedies by the Guarantied
Parties, and (d) a theory that this Guaranty should be strictly construed
against the Guarantied Parties, and (iv) all other defenses (except payment in
full of all Obligations and termination of the Commitment), including any
statute(s) of limitations, under applicable Law that would, but for this clause
(iv), be available to such Guarantor as a defense against, or a reduction,
extinguishment, discharge or release of its obligations under, this Guaranty.

7.       REINSTATEMENT OR GUARANTY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. Each
Guarantor agrees that, if any or all of a payment made by or on behalf of
Borrowers of any Guarantied Obligation is returned by any Person at any time for
any reason, including pursuant to any settlement, order (whether or not final)
of a court of competent jurisdiction, provision of any Debtor Relief Law or
other applicable Law or because of acts or omissions of Borrowers, the
Guarantied Obligations will not be deemed to have been satisfied to the extent
of the returned payment and the obligations of such Guarantor will be deemed to
be reinstated automatically and to continue in full force and effect. If any
Borrower ceases to be liable to the Guarantied Parties for any of the
Obligations (other than by reason of payment in full of all Obligations and
termination of the Commitment), then any prior release or discharge from this
Guaranty will be without effect and this Guaranty and

D-4

<PAGE>

the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder will be automatically reinstated and
continue in full force and effect.

8.       REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Guarantor represents and
warrants to the Guarantied Parties as follows:

(a)      AUTHORIZATION. Each Guarantor is duly authorized to execute
and perform this Guaranty, and this Guaranty has been properly authorized by all
requisite corporate, membership, or partnership action (as the case may be) of
such Guarantor. No consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, is required in
connection with such Guarantor's execution, delivery or performance of this
Guaranty, except for those already duly obtained.

(b)      DUE EXECUTION. This Guaranty has been executed on behalf of
each Guarantor by a legally competent Person duly authorized to do so.

(c)      ENFORCEABILITY. This Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof
against such Guarantor may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditor's rights generally or by equitable
principles of general application.

(d)      LEGAL RESTRAINTS. The execution of this Guaranty by each
Guarantor, and the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations under this
Guaranty, will not violate or constitute a default under the Charter Documents
of such Guarantor, any Material Agreement, or any Material Law, and will not,
except as expressly contemplated or permitted in this Guaranty, result in any
Security Interest being imposed on any of such Guarantor's property.

(e)      INDEPENDENT CREDIT EVALUATION. Each Guarantor has
independently, and without reliance on any information supplied by the
Guarantied Parties, taken, and will continue to take, whatever steps such
Guarantor deems necessary to evaluate the financial condition and affairs of
Borrowers and each other Guarantor. No Guarantied Party has any duty to advise
any Guarantor of information at any time known to it regarding the financial
condition or affairs of any Borrower or any other Guarantor.

(f)      NO REPRESENTATION BY THE GUARANTIED PARTIES. No Guarantied
Party has made any representation, warranty or statement to any Guarantor to
induce such Guarantor to execute this Guaranty.

9.       SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS. All representations, warranties,
and covenants of each Guarantor contained herein survive the execution and
delivery of this Guaranty, and terminate only upon Final Payment.

10.      AUTHORIZATION TO CHARGE ACCOUNTS. Each Guarantor hereby
authorizes each Guarantied Party, if and to the extent any amount payable by
such Guarantor under this Guaranty is not otherwise paid when due, to charge
such amount against any or all of the accounts of such Guarantor with such
Guarantied Party or any Affiliate of such Guarantied Party, with such Guarantor
remaining liable for any deficiency.

Form of Master Guaranty

D-5

<PAGE>

11.      GUARANTIED PARTIES' OFFSET RIGHTS. Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default and at any time and from time to time thereafter, each
Guarantied Party is hereby authorized, without notice to any Guarantor (any such
notice being expressly waived by each Guarantor), to setoff against the
Guarantied Obligations any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held, or any other Indebtedness at any time
owing by such Guarantied Party to or for the credit or the account of such
Guarantor, irrespective of whether or not demand has been made under the Credit
Agreement, any Note, or this Guaranty, and to remit the proceeds of such setoff
to such Guarantied Party for distribution to such Guarantied Party and
application to the Guarantied Obligations as provided in the Credit Agreement.

12.      ENFORCEMENT. Each Guarantor acknowledges that all of the
Guarantors are liable jointly and severally for the full amount of the
Guarantied Obligations. Suits for the enforcement of this Guaranty may be
brought, at the option of the Guarantied Parties, against all Guarantors, or
successively against each Guarantor, or against one or more but not against all
Guarantors.

13.      ATTORNEY'S FEES AND OTHER COSTS. If Guarantors fail to pay the
Guarantied Obligations as required by this Guaranty, then Guarantors will pay
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Guarantied Parties in
enforcing this Guaranty, including Attorney Costs (whether or not there is
litigation), court costs and all costs incurred in connection with any
proceedings under any Debtor Relief Law.

14.      RECORDS. The Guarantied Parties' books and records showing the
accounts between the Guarantied Parties and any Borrower are admissible in
evidence in any action or proceeding with respect to this Guaranty and
constitute prima facie proof of the information therein.

15.      BINDING NATURE OF CERTAIN ADJUDICATIONS. Each Guarantor will
be conclusively bound by the final adjudication in any action or proceeding,
legal or otherwise, involving any controversy arising under, in connection with,
or in any way related to, any of the Guarantied Obligations, and by a final
judgment, award or decree entered therein, if such Guarantor had the right, or
was given the opportunity, to participate in such action or proceeding and was
given notice of such action or proceeding in time to exercise such right or
avail itself of such opportunity.

16.      APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. All payments made under this Guaranty
will be allocated among the principal and interest and other components of the
Guarantied Obligations and the other obligations of a Guarantor hereunder in
such order and amount as the Guarantied Parties may determine in their sole and
absolute discretion.

17.      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. No Guarantied Party will have any
liability with respect to, and each Guarantor hereby waives, releases and agrees
not to sue for, (a) any loss or damage sustained by any Guarantor that may occur
as a result of, in connection with, or that is in any way related to, any act or
failure to act referred to in Section 5 of this Guaranty, or (b) any special,
indirect or consequential damages suffered by any Guarantor in connection with
any claim related to this Guaranty.

18.      MISCELLANEOUS.

(a)      NOTICES. All notices, consents, requests and demands to or
upon the respective parties hereto shall be given by Requisite Notice at the
address of Company set forth on Schedule 9.02 to the Credit Agreement. No notice
given to or demand made on any Guarantor by the Guarantied Parties in any
instance entitles any Borrower to notice or demand in any other instance.

(b)      AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment to, waiver of, or
departure from full compliance with any provision of this Guaranty, or consent
to any departure by any Guarantor herefrom, will be effective unless it is in
writing and signed by authorized officers of such Guarantor and Lender;
provided, however, that any such waiver or consent will be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No failure by Lender to
exercise, and no delay by any Guarantied Party in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any
single or partial exercise by any Guarantied Party of any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder preclude any other exercise thereof, or the exercise of
any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

(c)      RIGHTS CUMULATIVE. Each of the rights and remedies of the
Guarantied Parties under this Guaranty is in addition to all of their other
rights and remedies under applicable Law, and nothing in this Guaranty may be
construed as limiting any such rights or remedies.

(d)      SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Guaranty binds Guarantors and
their respective successors and assigns and inures to the benefit of the
Guarantied Parties, and each of its successors, transferees, participants and
assignees. No Guarantor may delegate or transfer any of its obligations under
this Guaranty without the prior written consent of Lender. With respect to each
Guarantor's successors and assigns, such successors and assigns include any
receiver, trustee or debtor-in-possession of or for such Guarantor.

(e)      SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Guaranty which is
prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized in any jurisdiction is, as to such
jurisdiction, ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, unenforceability or
nonauthorization without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

(f)      NO THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. This Guaranty is solely for the benefit
of the parties hereto and the Guarantied Parties, and their respective
successors and assigns, and no other Person has any right, benefit, priority or
interest under, or because of the existence of, this Guaranty.

(g)      COUNTERPARTS. This Guaranty may be executed by the parties
hereto on any number of separate counterparts, and all such counterparts taken
together constitute one and the same instrument. It is not necessary in making
proof of this Guaranty to produce or account for more than one counterpart
signed by the party to be charged.

(h)      COUNTERPART FACSIMILE EXECUTION. For purposes of this
Guaranty, a document (or signature page thereto) signed and transmitted by
facsimile machine or telecopier is to be treated as an original document. The
signature of any Person thereon, for purposes hereof, is to be considered as an
original signature, and the document transmitted is to be considered to have the
same binding effect as an original signature on an original document. At the
request of any party hereto, any facsimile or telecopy document is to be
re-executed in original form by the Persons who executed the facsimile or
telecopy document. No party hereto may raise the use of a facsimile

Form of Master Guaranty

D-7

<PAGE>

machine or telecopier or the fact that any signature was transmitted through the
use of a facsimile or telecopier machine as a defense to the enforcement of this
Guaranty or any amendment or other document executed in compliance with this
Section.

(i)      FINAL EXPRESSION; NO COURSE OF DEALING. This Guaranty,
together with the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other
agreement executed in connection herewith or therewith, is intended by the
parties as a final expression of their agreement and is intended as a complete
and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions thereof. Acceptance of or
acquiescence in a course of performance or course of dealing rendered or taken
under or with respect to this Guaranty, the Credit Agreement or the other Loan
Documents will not be relevant to determine the meaning of this Guaranty, the
Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents even though the accepting or
acquiescing party had knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity
for objection.

(j)      NEGOTIATED TRANSACTION. Each Guarantor and Guarantied Party
represent to the other that in the negotiation and drafting of this Guaranty
each has been represented by and has relied upon the advice of counsel of its
choice. Each Guarantor and Guarantied Party affirm that its counsel has had a
substantial role in the drafting and negotiation of this Guaranty; therefore,
this Guaranty will be deemed drafted by each of Borrowers and the Guarantied
Parties, and the rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to
be resolved against the drafter will not be employed in the interpretation of
this Guaranty.

(k)      ASSIGNMENT BY GUARANTIED PARTIES. To the extent permitted in
the Credit Agreement, the Guarantied Parties may grant a participation interest
in or assign or transfer to another Person any instrument, document or agreement
evidencing any of the Guarantied Obligations and the Guarantied Parties' rights
under this Guaranty.

(l)      CHOICE OF LAW, FORUM. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

(a)      THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE
AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE; PROVIDED THAT LENDER SHALL
RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

(b)      ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS GUARANTY
OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI
SITTING IN THE COUNTY OF ST. LOUIS OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE EASTERN
DISTRICT OF SUCH STATE, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS GUARANTY, EACH
GUARANTOR AND LENDER CONSENT, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH GUARANTOR AND LENDER
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE
OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER
HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT
OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO. EACH GUARANTOR AND
LENDER WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS,

Form of Master Guaranty

D-8

<PAGE>

WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF SUCH STATE.

(c)      EACH PARTY TO THIS GUARANTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER
ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT,
OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND
EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR
CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY
PARTY TO THIS GUARANTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS
SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES
HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

19.      ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS. Any Person required to become a
Guarantor pursuant to Section 6.10 of the Credit Agreement shall, upon complying
with such section, be deemed a Guarantor and this Guaranty shall be deemed
amended to include such additional Person as a party hereto as though a
signatory hereto, with no amendment or further action required hereunder, and
thereafter, all references to Guarantors shall include such additional Person.

20.      RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to
the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of
all payments made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and
receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder who has not
paid its proportionate share of all such payments. The provisions of this
Section shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any
Guarantor to the Guarantied Parties, and, subject to the provisions of Section
21 below, each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Guarantied Parties for the
full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder. The "proportionate share" of
any Guarantor shall be a fraction (which shall in no event exceed 1.00) the
numerator of which is the excess, if any, of the fair value of the assets of
such Guarantor over a fair estimate of the liabilities of such Guarantor and the
denominator of which is the excess (but not less than $1.00) of the fair value
of the aggregate assets (without duplication) of all Guarantors over a fair
estimate of the aggregate liabilities (without duplication) of all Guarantors.
All relevant calculations shall be made as of the date such Guarantor became a
Guarantor.

21.      LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere
contained herein or in any Loan Document to which any Guarantor is a Party, the
aggregate liability of each Guarantor hereunder (other than Company) for payment
and performance of the Guarantied Obligations shall not exceed an amount which,
in the aggregate, is $1.00 less than that amount which if so paid or performed
would constitute or result in a "fraudulent transfer," "fraudulent conveyance"
or terms of similar import, under applicable state or federal Law, including
without limitation, Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The
liability of each Guarantor hereunder is independent of any other guaranties at
any time in effect with respect to all or any part of the Guarantied
Obligations, and each Guarantor's liability hereunder may be enforced regardless
of the existence of any such guaranties. Any termination by or release of any
Guarantor in whole or in part (whether it be another Guarantor under this
instrument or not) shall not affect the continuing liability of any

Form of Master Guaranty

D-9

<PAGE>

Guarantor hereunder, and no notice of any such termination or release shall be
required. The execution hereof by each Guarantor is not founded upon an
expectation or understanding that there will be any other Guarantor of the
Guarantied Obligations.

22.      NOT USED.

(b)      Guarantors shall indemnify the Guarantied Parties against and
hold the Guarantied Parties harmless from all loss and damage resulting from any
change in exchange rates between the date any claim is reduced to judgment and
the date of payment (or, in the case of partial payments, the date of each
partial payment) thereof by any Guarantor. This indemnity shall constitute an
obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in this
Guaranty, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall
apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Guarantied Parties from time
to time, and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any
judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or
under any judgment or order.

23.      PAYMENTS EXEMPT FROM TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by
Guarantors to or for the account of the Guarantied Parties hereunder shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or
similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the
case of any Guarantied Party, taxes imposed on or measured by its net income,
branch profits or franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income or branch
profits taxes), by the United States of America or by the jurisdiction (or any
political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which such Guarantied Party is
organized, in which its principal office is located or in which it maintains a
lending office, and any other taxes withheld because such Guarantied Party
failed to timely deliver the forms required pursuant to Section 10.21 of the
Credit Agreement (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities
being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").

(b)      If a Guarantor shall be required by any Laws to deduct any
Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any
Guarantied Party, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section), such Guarantied Party receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) such Guarantor shall make such deductions, (iii) such Guarantor shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority
in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of
such payment, such Guarantor shall furnish to Lender the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

(c)      Each Guarantor will provide the Guarantied Parties with
original tax receipts, notarized copies of tax receipts, or such other
documentation as will prove payment of tax in a court of law applying the United
States Federal Rules of Evidence, for all taxes paid by a Guarantor pursuant to
subsection (b) above. Each Guarantor will deliver receipts to Lender within 30
days after the due date for the related tax.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Guaranty has been duly executed as of the date
first above written.

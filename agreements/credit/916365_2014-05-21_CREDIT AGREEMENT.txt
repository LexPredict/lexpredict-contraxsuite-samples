“Designated Jurisdiction” means any country or territory to the extent that such country or territory itself is the subject of any Sanction.

If a Swap Obligation arises under a master agreement governing more than one Hedging Agreement, such exclusion shall apply to only the portion of such Swap Obligation that is attributable to Hedging Agreements for which such Guaranty is or becomes illegal.

“Swap Obligation” means with respect to any Guarantor any obligation to pay or perform under any agreement, contract or transaction that constitutes a “swap” within the meaning of Section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act.


(d)    Section 3.7 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:


3.7    Inability to Determine Rates.


If in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent determines that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Loan or (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason the Eurodollar Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Loans or Interest Periods) and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Base Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Base Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be









suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.


(e)    A new Section 4.8 is hereby added to the Credit Agreement to read as follows:
4.8    Keepwell.


Each Credit Party that is a Qualified ECP Guarantor at the time the Guaranty in this Article IV by any Credit Party that is not then an “eligible contract participant” under the Commodity Exchange Act (a “Specified Credit Party”) or the grant of a security interest under the Credit Documents by any such Specified Credit Party, in either case, becomes effective with respect to any Swap Obligation, hereby  jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support to each Specified Credit Party with respect to such Swap Obligation as may be needed by such Specified Credit Party from time to time to honor all of its obligations under the Credit Documents in respect of such Swap Obligation (but, in each case, only up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor’s obligations and undertakings under this Article IV voidable under applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.  Each Credit Party intends this Section to constitute, and this Section shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each Specified Credit Party for all purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.


(f)    Section 6.2 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
6.2    No Material Change.

(h)    A new Section 8.15 is hereby added to the Credit Agreement to read as follows:


8.15    Sanctions.


Directly or indirectly, use any extension of credit hereunder or the proceeds of any such credit extension, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available such credit extension or the proceeds of any such credit extension to any Person, to fund any activities of or business with any Person, or in any Designated Jurisdiction, that, at the time of such funding, is the subject of Sanctions, or in any other manner that will result in a violation by any Person (including any Person participating in the









transaction, whether as Lender, Arranger, Administrative Agent, Issuing Lender, Swingline Lender, or otherwise) of Sanctions.


(i)    A new sentence is hereby added to the end of Section 9.3 of the Credit Agreement to read as follows:


Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Credit Party shall not be paid with amounts received from such Credit Party or such Credit Party’s assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from other Credit Parties to preserve the allocation to Credit Party Obligations otherwise set forth above in this Section.


(j)    Schedules 2.1(a) and 6.12.  Schedule 2.1(a) and Schedule 6.12 to the Credit Agreement are hereby deleted and replaced with Schedule 2.1(a) and Schedule 6.12, respectively, attached hereto.

(c)           Unless
the entire outstanding principal amount of any Eurodollar Borrowing is being
continued or converted, at the commencement of each Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
$5,000,000.  Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at
the same time; provided that there
shall not at any time be more than a total of ten (10) Eurodollar Borrowings
outstanding.  Each ABR Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that
is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000; provided that an ABR
Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused
balance of the total Commitments.




(d)           Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to
request, or to elect to convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest
Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity
Date.





Section 2.02      Funding of
Loans.




(a)           Each
Lender shall make the Loan to be made by it hereunder on the Closing Date, or,
in the case of an Incremental Loan, the date specified in the notice delivered
pursuant to Section 2.16(a) for the making of the Incremental Loan, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time to the
account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such
purpose by notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will make
such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so
received, in immediately available funds, to the account of the Borrower
designated by it for such purpose and previously communicated to the
Administrative Agent.  Each Lender at its option may make any
Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; provided that any
exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.




(b)           Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
Closing Date, or, in the case of an Incremental Loan, the date specified in the
notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.16(a) for the making of the
Incremental Loan, that such Lender will not make the Loan to be made by it, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Loan on such date
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In
such event, if a Lender has not in fact made the amount of its Loan available to
the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to
the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in
the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the
Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,
then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to assume
that any such Lender will fund its portion of any Loan and shall not be required
to make any advance of a Lender’s portion of any Loan until such time as the
Administrative Agent has received such Lender’s share of the applicable Loan
from such Lender.

(c)           The
failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not
relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the
Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for
any other Lender’s failure to make a Loan as required.




Section 2.03      Interest
Elections.




(a)           The
Borrower may elect to convert a Borrowing to a different Type or to continue a
Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods
therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The Borrower may elect
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing,
in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.




(b)           To
make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such election by telephone (i) in the case of a request
to convert or continue a Borrowing as a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the
proposed conversion or continuation or (ii) in the case of a request to convert
a Borrowing to an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
three Business Days before the date of the proposed conversion (each such notice
being called an “Interest Election
Request”).  Each such telephonic Interest Election Request
shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.




(c)           Each
telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following
information:




(i)        the
Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different
options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the
portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be
specified for each resulting Borrowing);




(ii)       the
effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request,
which shall be a Business Day;




(iii)      whether
the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;
and




(iv)      if the
resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be
applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period
contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.




If any
such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not
specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected
an Interest Period of one month’s duration.




(d)           Promptly
following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent
shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of
each resulting Borrowing.















19









Table of Contents








(e)           If
the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to
a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, then at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the
Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding
Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii)
unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing
at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.




(f)           Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, no Interest Period may be selected for
any Eurodollar Borrowing that would end later than a Repayment Date occurring on
or after the first day of such Interest Period if, after giving effect to such
selection, the aggregate outstanding amount of (i) the Eurodollar Borrowings
with Interest Periods ending on or prior to such Repayment Date and (ii) the ABR
Borrowings would not be at least equal to the principal amount of Borrowings to
be paid on such Repayment Date.





Section 2.04     Termination of
Commitments.




The Commitments (other than any
Incremental Loan Commitments, which shall terminate as provided in the related
Incremental Loan Assumption Agreement) shall automatically terminate upon the
making of the Loans on the Closing Date.





Section 2.05     Repayment of Loans; Evidence
of Debt.




(a)           The
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan of such
Lender as provided in Section 2.06.




(b)           Each
Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or
accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting
from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.




(c)           The
Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record
(i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s
share thereof.




(d)           The
entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b)
or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.




(e)           Any
Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory
note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender in a form to be approved
by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such
promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the payee named therein.

Section 2.06     Amortization of
Loans.

Section 2.06(c)) in the amounts and on the dates (each such date a “Repayment Date”) set
forth in the table below, unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Article VII,

to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment.




(c)           Any
prepayment of a Loan made pursuant to Section 2.07(c) shall be applied to reduce
the subsequent scheduled repayments of the Loans to be made pursuant to Section
2.06(a) ratably.  Any prepayment of a Loan made pursuant to
Section 2.07(a) shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled
repayments of the Loans to be made pursuant to Section 2.06(a) in direct order
of maturity beginning with the Loans to be repaid on the scheduled Repayment
Date next following the date of such prepayment.





Section 2.07     Prepayment of
Loans.




(a)           The
Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any
Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with
paragraph (b) of this Section.




(b)           The
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three
Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of prepayment of
an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business
Day before the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of
the Loans or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that a
notice of prepayment of the Loans in full may state that such notice is
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or agreements, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied.  Promptly following receipt of any such
notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof.  Each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate amount that
is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
$5,000,000.  Each prepayment shall be applied ratably to the Loans
included in the prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments shall be accompanied
by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.09 and any payment
required under Section 2.12.

(c)           The
Borrower shall on the date, if any, specified in Section 6.07(f) repay
Loans in the amounts and otherwise in all respects as provided in such
Section.




Section 2.08     Fees.  The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees
payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent.





Section 2.09      Interest.




(a)           The
Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base
Rate plus the Applicable Rate.




(b)           The
Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted
LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the
Applicable Rate.




(c)           Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount
payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated
maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear
interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in
the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable
to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in
the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as
provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.




(d)           Accrued
interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
for such Loan; provided that
(i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be
payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any
Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.




(e)           All
interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except
that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the
Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(f)           If,
as a result of any restatement or other adjustment to the financial statements
of the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine
that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any
applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the
Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, promptly on demand by the
Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of
an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of
the United States, automatically and without further action by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender), an amount equal to the excess of the amount
of interest that should have been paid for such period over the amount of
interest actually paid for such period.  This paragraph shall not
limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be,
under Section 2.09(c) or Article VII.  The Borrower’s obligations
under this paragraph shall cease upon the termination of the Commitments of all
of the Lenders and the repayment of all Loans made hereunder.





Section
2.10     Alternate
Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest
Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:




(a)           the
Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or




(b)           the
Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO
Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan)
included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;




then the
Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders
by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.





Section 2.11     Increased
Costs.




(a)           If
any Change in Law shall:




(i)           impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO
Rate); or




(ii)           impose
on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;




and the
result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of
making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest
or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.















23









Table of Contents








(b)           If
any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has
or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital
or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of
this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such
Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change
in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of
such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time
to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such
reduction suffered.




(c)           A
certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.




(d)           Failure
or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such
compensation; provided that the
Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section
for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the
date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to
such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided further that, if the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the
period of retroactive effect thereof.





Section
2.12    Break
Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section
2.07(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of
any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.15,
then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss,
cost and expense attributable to such event.  In the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to
include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan
had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been
applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last
day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest
Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on
such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender
would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in
dollars of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurodollar
market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or
amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall
be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

Section 2.13     Taxes.




(a)           Any
and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such
deductions, and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
law.




(b)           In
addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law.




(c)           The
Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10
days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may
be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority.  The Administrative Agent and each Lender will, at the
Borrower’s expense, cooperate in good faith with the Borrower in any contest as
to whether or not such Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes, penalties, interest or
expenses were correctly or legally imposed or asserted in the event such
Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes, penalties, interest or expenses were in the good
faith judgment of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
not legal or not correctly asserted.  If in connection with such
contest such Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes, penalties, interest or expenses are
refunded to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, the Administrative Agent or
such Lender will pay such refund to the Borrower to the extent the
Administrative Agent or such Lender determines in its sole discretion that such
refund is attributable to any Indemnified Taxes, Other Taxes, penalties,
interest or expenses paid by the Borrower and to the extent the Borrower has
previously indemnified the Administrative Agent or such Lender therefor pursuant
to this Section 2.13, net of expenses and without interest except any interest
(net of taxes) included in such refund.  The Borrower shall return
such refund (together with any taxes, penalties or other charges) in the event
the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
refund.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2.13
shall be construed to (i) entitle the Borrower or any other Persons to any
information determined by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in each case,
in its sole discretion, to be confidential or proprietary information of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to any tax or financial information of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender or to inspect or review any books and records
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or (ii) interfere with the rights
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to conduct its fiscal or tax affairs
in such matter as it deems fit.




A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.















25









Table of Contents








(d)           As
soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the
Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.




(e)           Any
Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding
tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any
treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under
this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate.




(f)           If
the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.13, it shall pay over such refund
to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.13 with respect to
the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket
expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other
than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund); provided that the
Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to
repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or
other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or
such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Authority.  This Section shall not be construed to require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the
Borrower or any other Person.





Section 2.14      Payments Generally; Pro Rata
Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.




(a)           The
Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of
principal, interest, fees or of amounts payable under Section 2.11, 2.12 or
2.13, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when
due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date shall
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes
of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to
the Administrative Agent’s Office, except that payments pursuant to
Sections 2.11, 2.12 or 2.13 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such
payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment
hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of
such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in
dollars.




(b)           If
at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees
then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of
interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto
in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties and
(ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to
such parties.

Table of Contents








(c)           If
any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or
otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of
its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of
the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the
proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans
of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that (i) if
any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans.  The
Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively
do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of
set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.




(d)           Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to
the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such
date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally
agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance
with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.




(e)           If
any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
Section 2.02(b) or 2.14(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its
discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts
thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender
to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.





Section 2.15     Mitigation Obligations;
Replacement of Lenders.




(a)           If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 2.13, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign
its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11 or 2.13,
as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.

(b)           If
(i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.11, (ii) the Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.13, (iii) any
Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) a Lender (a “Non-Consenting Lender”) does
not consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination with
respect to any Loan Document that has been approved by the Required Lenders as
provided in Section 9.02(b) but requires unanimous consent of all Lenders or all
Lenders directly affected thereby (as applicable), then the Borrower may, at its
sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04),
all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee
that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a
Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the
Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, to the extent required
by Section 9.04(b), (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount
equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon,
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee
(to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or
the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any
such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.11
or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.13, such assignment
will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case
of any such assignment resulting from a Non-Consenting Lender’s failure to
consent to the proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination with respect
to any Loan Document, the applicable replacement bank or financial institution
consents to the proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination; provided that the
failure by such Non-Consenting Lender to execute and deliver an Assignment and
Assumption shall not impair the validity of the removal of such Non-Consenting
Lender and the mandatory assignment of such Non-Consenting Lender’s Commitments
and outstanding Loans pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall nevertheless be
effective without the execution by such Non-Consenting Lender of an Assignment
and Assumption.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.





Section 2.16     Incremental
Loans.




(a)           The
Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time,
but no more than three (3) times, request Incremental Loan Commitments in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the Incremental Loan Amount from one or more
Incremental Lenders, which may include any existing Lender; provided that (i)
each Incremental Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to
the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (ii) no existing Lender shall be under any
obligation to provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment and any such decision
shall be in such Lender’s sole and absolute discretion. Such notice shall set
forth (i) the amount of the Incremental Loan Commitments being requested (which
shall be in minimum increments of $1,000,000 and a minimum amount of $5,000,000
or such lesser amount equal to the remaining Incremental Loan Amount), (ii) the
date on which such Incremental Loan Commitments are requested to become
effective (which shall not be less than five Business Days nor more than 60 days
after the date of such notice) and (iii) the date on which such Incremental
Loans shall be made by the Incremental Lenders.  Once made, all
Incremental Loans shall be treated as, and have the same terms as, Loans under
this Agreement.

(b)           The
Borrower and each Incremental Lender shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Incremental Loan Assumption Agreement and such other
documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence
the Incremental Loan Commitment of each Incremental Lender.  The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness
of each Incremental Loan Assumption Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby
agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Loan Assumption
Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the
extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Loan
Commitment and the Incremental Loans evidenced thereby.




(c)           Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Incremental Loan Commitment shall become effective under this
Section 2.16 and no Incremental Loan shall be funded unless (i) on the date of
such effectiveness and funding of such Incremental Loan, the conditions set
forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied and the
Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such
date and executed by the President, a Vice President or a Financial Officer of
the Borrower, and (ii) except as otherwise specified in the applicable
Incremental Loan Assumption Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have
received (with sufficient copies for each of the Incremental Lenders) legal
opinions, board resolutions and other closing certificates reasonably requested
by the Administrative Agent and consistent with those delivered on the Closing
Date under Section 4.01.




(d)           Each
of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may, in
consultation with the Borrower, take any and all action as may be reasonably
necessary to ensure that all Incremental Loans, when originally made, are
included in each Borrowing of outstanding Loans on a pro rata
basis.  This may be accomplished by requiring each outstanding
Eurodollar Borrowing to be converted into an ABR Borrowing on the date of each
Incremental Loan, or by allocating a portion of each Incremental Loan to each
outstanding Eurodollar Borrowing on a pro rata basis.  Any conversion
of Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans required by the preceding sentence shall be
subject to Section 2.12.  If any Incremental Loan is to be allocated
to an existing Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing, then the economic
consequences thereof shall be as set forth in the applicable Incremental
Assumption Agreement.

delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.




The bank serving as the Administrative
Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a
Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or
any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative
Agent hereunder.




The Administrative Agent shall not have
any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth

(a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other
implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing,

discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary

required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving
as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any
capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action
taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of
its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  The Administrative
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until

Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or

Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein,
other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.




The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other
writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the
proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the
proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying
thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or
experts.




The Administrative Agent may perform
any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one
or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related
Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall
apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative
Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in

the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the
Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have
the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a
successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the

Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
successor.  After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder,
the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect
for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as the Administrative
Agent.




Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based
on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder.

notwithstanding, none of the Joint Book Managers, Joint Lead Arrangers,
Co-Documentation Agents or Syndication Agent listed on the cover page hereof

(d)      Notices
and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished
by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the
Administrative Agent; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article II unless otherwise
agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender.  The

notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications
pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that
approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or

(e)       Any

communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto.  All
notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date
of receipt.




Section 9.02      Waivers;
Amendments.




(a)           No
failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any
right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or
power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of
this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative
Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the
time.




(b)           Neither
this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified
except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such
agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written
consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce
the rate of interest thereon, without the written consent of each Lender
directly affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the
principal amount of any Loan or any interest thereon, or reduce the amount of,
waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration
of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby, (iv) change Section 2.14(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro
rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each
Lender, or (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of
“Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or
make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written
consent of each Lender; provided further that no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent; provided, further, however, no
Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment,
waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Commitment of such Lender may not
be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender.





Section
9.03      Expenses; Indemnity; Damage
Waiver.




(a)           The
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation
and administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers
of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with
the Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred
during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Loans.















47









Table of Contents










(b)           The
Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
“Indemnitee”)
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any
Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any
Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged
presence or Release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or
operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental
Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv)
any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.




(c)           To
the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it
to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each
Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s pro
rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense
or indemnity payment is sought) based on the amount of its unexpired Commitment
or outstanding Loans or, if no Loans shall be outstanding, on the amount of its
Loans on the most recent date on which Loans were outstanding, of such unpaid
amount; provided that the
unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.




(d)           To
the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and
hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions,
any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.




(e)           All
amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand
therefor.





Section 9.04      Successors and
Assigns.




(a)           The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
except that, (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender
(and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent
shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its
rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this
Section.  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.















48









Table of Contents








(b)           Any
Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that
(i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
Lender or an Approved Fund, each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall in
any case not be unreasonably withheld; it being understood that it is not
unreasonable to withhold consent with respect to any proposed assignment to any
financial institution having net capital and surplus of less than $1,000,000,000
or senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money with a credit
rating of less than A-), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender,
an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire
remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans, the amount of
the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$5,000,000 and after giving effect thereto, the assigning Lender must have
Commitments or Loans aggregating at least $5,000,000, unless each of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) the parties
to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and provided further that any
consent of the Borrower otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be
required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII
has occurred and is continuing.  Subject to acceptance and recording
thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 and
9.03).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall
be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of
this Section.  By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Assumption, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be
deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as
follows:  (1)  such assigning Lender warrants that it is the
legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear
of any adverse claim and that its Commitment, and the outstanding balances of
its Loans, in each case without giving effect to assignments thereof which have
not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption, (2)
except as set forth in (1) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation
or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement, or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto, or the financial condition of the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or the performance or observance by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any Loan
Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, (3) such
assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into
such Assignment and Assumption, (4) such assignee confirms that it has received
a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial
statements referred to in Section 3.04 or delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 and
such other documents and information as it has been deemed appropriate to make
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Assumption, (5) such assignee will independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement, (6) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms
hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and (7)
such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the
obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by
it as a Lender.

(c)           The
Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall
maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and
Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
“Register”).  The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.




(d)           Upon
its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative
Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the
processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section
and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this
Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption
and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.




(e)           Any
Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “Participant”) in all
or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that
(i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such
Participant.  Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower
agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11,
2.12 and 2.13 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To
the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14(c) as though it were a
Lender.

Table of Contents








(f)           A
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section
2.11 or 2.13 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written
consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13 unless the
Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
2.13(e) as though it were a Lender.




(g)           Any
Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a
security interest; provided that no such
pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of
its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such
Lender as a party hereto.





Section
9.05     Survival.  All
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower
herein and in the certificates or other instruments  delivered in
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the
Commitments have not expired or terminated.  The provisions of
Sections 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and
remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or
termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.





Section
9.06      Counterparts;
Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each
of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together
shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and any separate
letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent
constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section
9.07      Severability.  Any
provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.





Section
9.08      Right of
Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such
Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against
any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under
this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender
shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations
may be unmatured.  The rights of each Lender under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which
such Lender may have.





Section 9.09      Governing Law; Jurisdiction;
Consent to Service of Process.




(a)           This
Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the
State of New York.




(b)           Each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the
State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District
Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal
court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.




(c)           Each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in
paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.




(d)           Each
party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.





Section
9.10     WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION.

9.11     Headings.  Article

Agreement.





Section
9.12     Confidentiality.  Each
of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
(it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep
such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any
regulatory authority, (c) to the extent  required by applicable
laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any
other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing

of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower, or
(h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Borrower.  For the purposes of this
Section, “Information” means
all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its
business, other than any such information that is available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the
case of information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as
confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.




Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, “Information” shall not include, and the Administrative Agent and each
Lender may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, any
information with respect to the U.S. federal income tax treatment and U.S.
federal income tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to the Administrative Agent or such Lender relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure.





Section
9.13     Interest
Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with
all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan
under applicable law (collectively, the “Charges”), shall
exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) which
may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender
holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest
payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in
respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful,
the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan
but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be
cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of
other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate
therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received
by such Lender.

Section
9.14      USA Patriot
Act.  Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to
the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed
into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”), it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the
Act.





Section 9.15     No
Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship.  In connection with all
aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with
any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan
Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees that:
(i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by
the Administrative Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers are arm’s-length
commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers, on the other
hand, (B) the
Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to
the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the Borrower is capable of
evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the
Administrative Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers are and have been acting
solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant
parties, have not been, are not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or
fiduciary for the Borrower or
any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the Administrative
Agent nor any Joint Lead Arranger has any obligation to the Borrower or any of
its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those
obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and
(iii) the Administrative Agent and the Joint Lead Arrangers and their respective
Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve
interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither
the Administrative Agent nor any Joint Lead Arranger has any obligation to
disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower

Commitment, the Dollar Borrowers having the right to borrow, repay and reborrow.
Each Dollar Loan shall be in an amount of at least $250,000 or the Unused Dollar
Commitment, whichever is less.  Each repayment of the Dollar Loans shall be in
an amount of at least $250,000 or the principal balance of the Dollar Note,

2.2 Letter of Credit.
(a) Issuance.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Lender
agrees to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Dollar Borrowers from
time to time before the Termination Date, in such face amount, with such expiry
date (provided that no Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date beyond one
year from the date of issuance) and for the benefit of such beneficiary as the
Dollar Borrowers may designate in the related Application; provided that (x) the
Letter of Credit Exposure may never exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment and
(y) the principal balance of the Dollar Note shall not exceed the Dollar
Available Commitment after giving effect to such Letter of Credit.

(b) Fees.  As a condition precedent to the issuance of each Letter of
Credit, the Dollar Borrowers agree to pay the Lender the (1) usual and customary
fees of the Lender for each

14
<PAGE>

issuance, extension, amendment and wire advice of and drawing under a Letter of
Credit and (2) a fee equal to the greater of (i) $250 for each Letter of Credit
or (ii) 1% per annum (calculated on the basis of the actual number of days to
elapse in a year composed of 360 days) of the face amount of such Letter of
Credit to its date of expiry.

(c) Cash Collateral.  Upon the occurrence of the Termination Date (whether
by the passage of time or otherwise), the Dollar Borrowers will immediately
either (1) provide the Lender with Cash Collateral in an amount equal to the
Letter of Credit Exposure at such time or (2) provide the Lender with one or
more back-up letters of credit, with face amounts corresponding to the
outstanding face amounts of the outstanding Letters of Credit and expiry dates
at least one month beyond the expiry dates of the corresponding outstanding
Letters of Credit, such back-up letters of credit to be in Proper Form and
issued by financial institutions acceptable to the Lender.  If the Letter of
Credit Exposure ever exceeds the Letter of Credit Commitment, the Dollar
Borrowers will immediately (1) provide the Lender with Cash Collateral equal to
the amount of such excess or (2) obtain from the beneficiaries of Letters of
Credit a reduction in the aggregate amount of such Letters of Credit at least
equal to the amount of such excess (or a combination thereof).  In the event
that any Borrower deposits Cash Collateral pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence and the Letter of Credit Exposure is thereafter reduced below the
Letter of Credit Commitment at such time, the Lender will upon request of the
Borrowers promptly return to the Borrowers Cash Collateral in the amount of such
shortfall.

(d) Additional Conditions.  The issuance by the Lender of each Letter of
Credit shall be subject to the additional conditions precedent that (1) such
Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain such terms as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Lender; (2) the Dollar Borrowers shall have
executed and delivered such other instruments and agreements relating to such
Letter of Credit as the Lender shall have reasonably requested, and (3) the
terms of such Letter of Credit are not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement.

(e) Indemnification.  The Dollar Borrowers hereby indemnify, release and
hold the Lender and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents
harmless from and against any and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities,
costs or expenses which any of them may incur (or which may be claimed against
any of them by any Person whatsoever) to which any of them may become subject
arising out of or based upon the execution and delivery or transfer of or
payment or failure to pay under any Letter of Credit, WHETHER THROUGH THE
ALLEGED OR ACTUAL NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH PERSON OR OTHERWISE; except and to the
extent that the same results from the willful misconduct, gross negligence or
bad faith of such Person.

2.3 Pound Loans.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Lender
agrees to make Pound Loans to DSL from time to time before the Termination Date,
not to exceed at any one time outstanding the Pound Available Commitment, DSL
having the right to borrow, repay and reborrow.  Each Pound Loan shall be in an
amount of at least (Pounds)100,000 or the Unused Pound Commitment, whichever is
less.  Each repayment of the Pound Loans shall be in an amount of

15

at least (Pounds)100,000 or the principal balance of the Pound Note, whichever
is less.  The Pound Loans shall be evidenced by the Pound Note, substantially in
the form of Exhibit B.

2.4 Mandatory Prepayments.  If the principal balance of the Dollar Note
ever exceeds the Dollar Available Commitment or the principal balance of the

Borrower shall immediately (1) make a prepayment on the relevant Note in the
amount of such excess or (2) obtain from the beneficiaries of any outstanding
Letters of Credit a reduction in the aggregate amount of such Letters of Credit
(or a combination thereof).

2.5 Voluntary Commitment Reductions.  At any time and from time to time,
upon five Business Days' notice, (a) the Dollar Borrowers may reduce the Maximum
Commitment by an integral multiple of $500,000; (b) DSL may reduce the Nominal
Pound Commitment by an integral multiple of (Pounds)250,000; (c) the Dollar
Borrowers may terminate the Dollar Commitment, and (d) DSL may terminate the
Pound Commitment; provided that such reduction or termination (x) may not cause
(1) the maximum amount permissible to be outstanding under either Note pursuant
to the terms of the Credit Documents to be less than the then-outstanding
principal balance of such Note or (2) the Letter of Credit Exposure to exceed
the Letter of Credit Commitment and (y) shall be permanent, and the relevant
Commitment may not thereafter be increased or restored.

2.6 Commitment Fees.  In consideration of (a) the Maximum Commitment, the
Dollar Borrowers agree to pay a fee of 1/4% per annum on the daily average
Unused Maximum Commitment; such fee (the "Commitment Fee") shall be (x) computed
on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year composed of 360 days
and (y) payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each January, April, July
and October and on the Termination Date.  From the effective day of any
reduction or termination in accordance with Section 2.5, the several obligations
of the Dollar Borrowers to pay the Commitment Fee shall be correspondingly
reduced.

2.7 Payments.  Unless otherwise expressly provided therein, all payments
of principal, interest and other fees and amounts due from any Borrower under
the Credit Documents shall be made in immediately available funds to the Lender
at its principal banking building in Houston, Harris County, Texas, by no later

considered for all purposes (including the payment of interest, to the extent
not prohibited by law) as having been made on the next succeeding Business Day.
If any payment or prepayment becomes due and payable on a day which is not a
Business Day, then the date for the payment thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable thereon at the then-
applicable rate per annum during such extension.  All amounts paid or payable
under the Credit Documents (a) by the Dollar Borrowers shall be denominated in
Dollars, and any payment in Pounds shall be credited for the Dollar Equivalent
thereof, and (b) by DSL shall be denominated in Pounds, and any payment in
Dollars shall be credited for the Sterling Equivalent thereof.

2.8      Capital Adequacy.

(a) If after the date of this Agreement, the Lender shall have determined
that the adoption or effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation
regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by the Lender with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the Lender's capital as a consequence
of its obligations under the Credit Documents to a level below that which the
Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking
into consideration the Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount reasonably deemed by the Lender to be material, then from time to time,
the Dollar Borrowers shall pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate the Lender for such reduction.

(b) A certificate of the Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as
shall be necessary to compensate the Lender as specified in Section 2.8 (a)
shall be delivered as soon as practicable to the Dollar Borrowers and shall be
conclusive and binding, absent manifest error. The Dollar Borrowers shall pay
the Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after
the Lender delivers such certificate. In preparing such certificate, the Lender
may employ such assumptions and allocations of costs and expenses as it shall in
good faith deem reasonable and may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
method.

(c) A Dollar Borrower's obligations under this Section shall survive the
payment of the such Dollar Borrower's Loans and the termination of such Dollar
Borrower's Commitment; provided that any request for compensation pursuant to
this Section must be made on or before six (6) months after the Lender incurs
the applicable material reduction in rate of return or the Lender shall be
deemed to have waived the right to such compensation.

3. Guaranty.

3.1 Guaranty of Pound Note.  The Dollar Borrowers unconditionally
guarantee unto the Lender the payment of the principal of and accrued interest

"Pound Obligations").  This guaranty is unconditional and absolute, and if for
any reason all or any portion of the Pound Obligations shall not be paid
promptly when due, the Dollar Borrowers will immediately pay the same to the

may have or assert, and regardless of whether the Lender or any other Person
shall have taken any steps to enforce any rights against DSL or any other Person
to collect such sum, and regardless of any other condition or contingency.  This

applicable law: (a) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of
the performance or observance by DSL or any other co-guarantor, surety, endorser
or other obligor of any express or implied agreement, covenant, term or
condition in any Credit Document to be performed or observed by such party; (b)
the extension of the time for the payment of all or any portion of the Pound
Obligations or the extension of time for the performance of any other
obligations of DSL under, arising out of, or in connection with the Credit

otherwise) of any of the Credit Documents (with respect to the obligations of

of diligence on the part of the Lender or any other Person, to enforce, assert
or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on the Lender or any
other Person in any of the Credit Documents, or any action on the part of the
Lender or such other Person granting indulgence or extension of any kind; (e)
the release of any Lien or the release, modification, waiver or failure to
enforce any Lien, insurance agreement, bond or other guaranty, surety or
indemnity agreement whatsoever; (f) the release, modification, waiver or failure
to enforce any right, benefit, privilege or interest under any contract or
agreement, under which the rights of DSL under the Credit Documents or any other

granted, to the Lender as direct or indirect security for payment of all or any
part of the Pound Obligations or performance of any obligations of DSL under the
Credit Documents; (g) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution,
sale of any collateral, marshaling of assets and liabilities, receivership,
insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization,
arrangement, composition or readjustment of debt of, or other similar

co-guarantor for DSL under the Credit Documents or any of the Property of DSL or
of any other surety or co-guarantor for DSL under the Credit Documents; (h) any
invalidity of or defect or deficiency in any of the Credit Documents or failure
to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any Lien securing payment of the
Pound Obligations, or any portion thereof, or performance of DSL's or any other
Person's obligations under the Credit Documents, or (i) the settlement or
compromise of all or any part of Pound Obligations.

3.3 Waivers.  The Dollar Borrowers hereby waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, (a) marshaling of assets and liabilities; (b) sale
in inverse order of alienation; (c) notice of acceptance of this guaranty and of

payment; (f) protest; (g) notice of nonpayment; (h) notice of dishonor; (i)

34 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code; Section 17.001 of the Texas Civil
Practice and Remedies Code, and Rule 31 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.

3.4 Payment Guaranty.  This is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, and the Dollar Borrowers waive any right to require that any action
be brought against DSL or any other Person.  Should the Lender seek to enforce
the obligations of the Dollar Borrowers under this Article by action in any
court, the Dollar Borrowers waive any necessity, substantive or procedural, that
a judgment previously be rendered against DSL or any other Person or that DSL or
any other Person be joined in such cause or that a separate action be brought
against DSL or any other Person; the obligations of the Dollar Borrowers under
this Article are several from those of DSL or any other Person, including any
other surety or co-guarantor for DSL, and are primary obligations concerning
which the Dollar Borrowers are each a principal obligor.  All waivers herein
contained shall be without prejudice to the Lender at its option to proceed
against the Dollar Borrowers, DSL or any other Person, whether by separate
action or by joinder.  The Dollar Borrowers agree that this guaranty shall not

of all obligations of the Lender to make Pound Loans, and (c) complete
performance of all obligations of the Dollar Borrowers contained in this
Article.

Dollar Borrowers under this Article or any set-off or application of funds of
the Dollar Borrowers by the Lender with respect to the Pound Note, the Dollar
Borrowers shall not be entitled to exercise any subrogation in respect of the
rights of the Lender against DSL or any collateral security or rights of offset
held by the Lender for the payment of the obligations of DSL under the Credit
Documents until such time as all Indebtedness owing to the Lender under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall have been paid in full and the
obligation of the Lender to make further advances hereunder shall have
terminated.

such remedies, rights and powers shall be cumulative.

9. Miscellaneous.

9.1 No Waiver.  No waiver of any Default shall be deemed to be a waiver of
any other Default.  No failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or
power under any Credit Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power preclude any further or
other exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The Lender
may remedy any Default without waiving the Default remedied.  Acceptance by the
Lender of a payment in an amount less than the amount then due shall be deemed
an acceptance on account only and shall not in any way affect the existence of a
Default.  No amendment, modification or waiver of any Credit Document shall be
effective unless the same is in writing and signed by the Person against whom
such amendment is sought to be enforced.  No notice to or demand on a Borrower
or any other Person shall entitle any    Borrower or any other Person to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

9.2 Notices.  All notices under the Credit Documents shall be in writing
and either (1) delivered against receipt therefor; (2) mailed by registered or

mailed, on the next Business Day); however, the notices required or permitted by
Sections 2.5 and 4.1 hereof shall be effective only when actually received by
the Lender. Actual notice, however and from whomever given or received, shall
always be effective when received.

9.3 Governing Law.  Unless otherwise specified therein, each Credit
Document shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas and the USA. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably (a) agrees that any

Houston Division (collectively, the "Specified Courts"); (b) submits to the non-

law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of any Credit Document or the
transactions contemplated thereby in the Specified Courts, and (e) waives any

brought in an inconvenient forum.  DSL hereby appoints DSI as DSL's agent for
service of process.  All of the obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit
Documents are performable in Harris County, Texas.

9.4 Survival; Parties Bound; Term.  All representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection
herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of the Credit Documents, and
shall bind the Borrowers and their respective successors, trustees, receivers
and assigns and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the
Lender, provided that the separate undertakings of the Lender hereunder to make
Loans to the Borrowers shall not inure to the benefit of any successor or assign
of any Borrower.  The term

30
<PAGE>

of this Agreement shall be until the final maturity of all of the Notes, the
expiry of all Letters of Credit, the termination of all of the Commitments and
the payment of all amounts due under the Credit Documents.  The Borrowers agree
that if at any time all or any part of any payment previously applied by the
Lender to any Loan or other obligation hereunder is or must be returned by or
recovered from the Lender for any reason (including the order of any bankruptcy
court), the Credit Documents shall automatically be reinstated to the same
effect as if the prior application had not been made, and each Borrower hereby
agrees to indemnify each such payee against, and to save and hold each such
payee harmless from, any required return by or recover from each such payee of
any such payment previously made by such Borrower because of such payment being
deemed preferential under applicable Legal Requirements, or for any other
reason.

9.5 Counterparts.  Each Credit Document may be executed in several
identical counterparts, and by the parties thereto on separate counterparts, and
each counterpart, when so executed and delivered, shall constitute an original
instrument, and all such separate counterparts shall constitute but one and the
same instrument.

9.6 Captions.  The headings and captions appearing in the Credit Documents
have been included solely for convenience and shall not be considered in
construing the Credit Documents.

9.7 Expenses.  Any provision to the contrary notwithstanding, and whether
or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated, the
Dollar Borrowers shall pay on demand all out-of-pocket expenses (including,
without limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel for the Lender) reasonably
incurred in connection with (a) the negotiation, preparation, execution, filing,
recording, refiling, re-recording, modification, supplementing and waiver of the
Credit Documents (provided that the Borrowers may condition their agreement to
enter into any such modification, supplement or waiver upon such expenses not
exceeding a specified amount or any similar condition); (b) the making,
servicing and collection of the Loans; (c) the evaluating, monitoring,
administering and protecting any of the Collateral; (d) the realizing upon the
Collateral and all costs and expenses relating to the Lender's exercising any of
its rights and remedies under any of the Credit Documents or at law, and (e) the
performance by the Lender (in a Borrower's name or otherwise) of any agreement,
covenant or obligations of a Borrower under the Credit Documents which such
Borrower had not performed, in each case including all appraisal fees,
consulting fees, filing fees, taxes, brokerage fees and commissions and Uniform
Commercial Code search fees; provided that no right or option granted by a
Borrower to the Lender pursuant to any Credit Document shall be deemed to impose
or admit a duty on the Lender to supervise, monitor or control any aspect of the
character or condition of any of the Collateral or any operations conducted in
connection with it for the benefit of any Borrower or any other Person.
Interest shall accrue on all such expenses from the date of demand therefor at
the lesser of (1) the Past Due Rate or (2) the Highest Lawful Rate if such
expenses are not reimbursed within 15 days after such date of demand.  The
obligations of the Dollar Borrowers under Section 2.2(e), this Section and the
following Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

hold the Lender and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees and agents
(collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") harmless from and against any and all
loss, liability, obligation, damage, penalty, judgment, claim, deficiency and
expense (including interest, penalties, attorneys' fees and amounts paid in
settlement) to which any of them may become subject arising out of or based upon
the Credit Documents, WHETHER THROUGH THE ALLEGED OR ACTUAL NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH
PERSON OR OTHERWISE, except and to the extent that the same results from the
gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of such Indemnified Person.

9.9 Entire Agreement.  The Credit Documents embody the entire agreement
between the Borrowers and the Lender and supersedes all prior proposals,
agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

9.10 Severability. If any provision of any Credit Document shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be
affected or impaired thereby. Each waiver in the Credit Documents is subject to
the overriding and controlling rule that it shall be effective only if and to
the extent that (a) it is not prohibited by applicable law and (b) applicable
law neither provides for nor allows any material sanctions to be imposed against
the Lender for having bargained for and obtained it.

9.11 Disclosures. Every reference in the Credit Documents to disclosures
of any Borrower to the Lender, to the extent that such references refer to
disclosures at or before the execution of this Agreement, shall be deemed
strictly to refer only to written disclosures delivered to the Lender in an
orderly manner concurrently with the execution hereof.

9.12 Obligations of Dollar Borrowers Are Joint And Several. All of the
liabilities and obligations of the Dollar Borrowers under this Agreement and
under the other Credit Documents shall be joint and several. Each of the
Borrowers represents and warrants that such Borrower has not been required to
become jointly and severally liable for the obligations of any other Person
under this Agreement as a condition to such Borrower's receipt of any loan or
other extension of credit made pursuant to this Agreement, the Credit Documents,
or any other document executed in connection therewith.

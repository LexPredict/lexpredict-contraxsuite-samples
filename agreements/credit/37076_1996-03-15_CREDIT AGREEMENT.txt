2.3.6.  Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Committed
Advances.  Floating Rate Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances
unless and until such Floating Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar
Committed Advances.  Each Eurodollar Committed Advance shall continue as a
Eurodollar Committed Advance until the end of the then applicable Eurodollar
Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Committed Advance shall
be automatically converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless such Eurodollar
Committed Advance is paid by the Borrower or the Borrower shall have given the
Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice requesting that, at the end of such
Eurodollar Interest Period, such Eurodollar Committed Advance continue as a
Eurodollar

Committed Advance for the same or another Eurodollar Interest Period.  Subject
to the terms of Section 2.3.3, the Borrower may elect from time to time to
convert all or any part of a Floating Rate Advance into a Eurodollar Committed
Advance.  The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a
"Conversion/Continuation Notice") of each conversion of Floating Rate Advance
or continuation of a Eurodollar Committed Advance not later than 10:00 a.m.
(Chicago time) at least three Business Days prior to the date of the requested
conversion or continuation, specifying:

(i)    the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
conversion or continuation;

(ii)   the aggregate amount and Type of the Committed Advance
which is to be converted or continued; and

(iii)  the amount and Type(s) of Committed Advance(s) into which
such Committed Advance is to be converted or continued
and, in the case of a conversion into or continuation of a
Eurodollar Committed Advance, the duration of the
Eurodollar Interest Period applicable thereto.

2.4.   Competitive Bid Advances.

2.4.1.   Competitive Bid Option; Repayment of Competitive Bid
Advances.  In addition to Committed Advances pursuant to Section 2.3, but
subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the limitation set forth in Section 2.1 as to the maximum
aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances hereunder), the Borrower
may, as set forth in this Section 2.4, request the Lenders, prior to the
Termination Date, to make offers to make Competitive Bid Advances to the
Borrower.  Each Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers
and the Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers
in the manner set forth in this Section 2.4.  The Competitive Bid Advances
shall be evidenced by the Competitive Bid Notes.  Each Competitive Bid Advance
shall be repaid in full by the Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto.

2.4.2.   Competitive Bid Quote Request.  When the Borrower
wishes to request offers to make Competitive Bid Loans under this Section 2.4,
the Borrower shall transmit to the Agent by telecopy a Competitive Bid Quote
Request so as to be received no later than (x) 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at
least five Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date proposed therein, in the
case of a Eurodollar Auction, or (y) 9:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least one
Business Day prior to the Borrowing Date proposed therein, in the case of an
Absolute Rate Auction, specifying in accordance with all of the terms of this
Agreement:





Page 16
<PAGE>   23

(i)    the proposed Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, for
the proposed Competitive Bid Advance;

(ii)   the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance;

(iii)  whether the Competitive Bid Quotes requested are to set forth a
Competitive Bid Margin or an Absolute Rate, or both; and

(iv)   the Interest Period applicable thereto.

The Borrower may request offers to make Competitive Bid Loans for more than one
Interest Period and for a Eurodollar Auction and an Absolute Rate Auction in a
single Competitive Bid Quote Request.  No Competitive Bid Quote Request shall
be given within five Business Days (or upon reasonable prior notice to the
Lenders, such other number of days as the Borrower and the Agent may agree) of
any other Competitive Bid Quote Request.  Each Competitive Bid Quote Request
shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and in multiples of $500,000 in
excess thereof).  A Competitive Bid Quote Request that does not conform
substantially to the format of Exhibit "B" hereto shall be rejected, and the
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of such rejection by telecopy.

2.4.3.   Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes.  Promptly upon
receipt of a Competitive Bid Quote Request that is not rejected pursuant to
Section 2.4.2, the Agent shall send to each of the Lenders by telecopy an
Invitation for Competitive Bid Quotes which shall constitute an invitation by
the Borrower to each Lender to submit Competitive Bid Quotes offering to make
the Competitive Bid Loans to which such Competitive Bid Quote Request relates
in accordance with this Section 2.4.

2.4.4.   Submission and Contents of Competitive Bid Quotes.

(a)     Each Lender may, in its sole discretion, submit a Competitive
Bid Quote containing an offer or offers to make Competitive
Bid Loans in response to any Invitation for Competitive Bid
Quotes.  Each Competitive Bid Quote must comply with the
requirements of this Section 2.4.4 and must be submitted to
the Agent by telecopy at its offices specified in or pursuant
to Article XIII not later than (i) (A) 12:45 p.m. (Chicago
time) in the case of First Chicago and (B) 1:00 p.m. (Chicago
time) in the case of each other Lender, at least four Business
Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date in the case of a
Eurodollar Auction, or (ii) (A) 8:45 a.m. (Chicago time) in
the case of First Chicago and (B) 9:00 a.m. (Chicago time) in
the case of each other Lender, on the proposed Borrowing Date
in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction





Page 17
<PAGE>   24

(or, in either such case upon reasonable prior notice to the Lenders,
such other time and date as the Borrower and the Agent may agree;
provided that First Chicago shall always be required to submit its
Competitive Bid Quotes not less than fifteen minutes prior to the
other Lenders).  Subject to Articles IV and VIII, any Competitive Bid
Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of
the Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower.

(b)         Each Competitive Bid Quote shall in any case specify:

(i)   the proposed Borrowing Date, which shall be the same
as that set forth in the applicable Invitation for
Competitive Bid Quotes;

(ii)  the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for
which each such offer is being made, (1) which
principal amount may be greater than, less than or
equal to the Commitment of the quoting Lender, but
in no case greater than the unutilized Aggregate
Commitment, (2)  which principal amount must be at
least $5,000,000 (and in multiples of $500,000 in
excess thereof) and (3) which principal amount may
not exceed the principal amount of Competitive Bid
Loans for which offers were requested;

(iii) in the case of a Eurodollar Auction, the
Competitive Bid Margin offered for each such
Competitive Bid Loan;

(iv)  the minimum or maximum amount, if any, of the
Competitive Bid Loan which may be accepted by the
Borrower and/or the limit, if any, as to the
aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bid
Loans from such Lender which may be accepted by the
Borrower;

(v)   in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the
Absolute Rate offered for each such Competitive Bid
Loan;

(vi)  the applicable Interest Period; and

(vii) the identity of the quoting Lender.





Page 18
<PAGE>   25

(c)         The Agent shall reject any Competitive Bid Quote that:

(i)          is not substantially in the form of Exhibit
"D" hereto or does not specify all of the
information required by Section 2.4.4(b);

(ii)         contains qualifying, conditional or similar
language, other than any such language
contained in Exhibit "D" hereto;

(iii)        proposes terms other than or in addition to
those set forth in the applicable Invitation
for Competitive Bid Quotes; or

(iv)         arrives after the time set forth in Section
2.4.4(a).

(d)         If any Competitive Bid Quote shall be rejected pursuant to
Section 2.4.4(c), then the Agent shall notify the relevant
Lender of such rejection as soon as practicable.

2.4.5.   Notice to Borrower.  The Agent shall promptly notify
the Borrower of the terms (i) of any Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a
Lender that is in accordance with Section 2.4.4 and (ii) of any Competitive Bid
Quote that is in accordance with Section 2.4.4 and amends, modifies or is
otherwise inconsistent with a previous Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such
Lender with respect to the same Competitive Bid Quote Request.  Any such
subsequent Competitive Bid Quote shall be disregarded by the Agent unless such
subsequent Competitive Bid Quote specifically states that it is submitted
solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive Bid Quote.  The
Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify the aggregate principal amount of
Competitive Bid Loans for which offers have been received for each Interest
Period specified in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request and the
respective principal amounts and Competitive Bid Margins or Absolute Rates, as
the case may be, so offered.

2.4.6.   Acceptance and Notice by Borrower.  Subject to the
receipt of the notice from the Agent referred to in Section 2.4.5, not later
than (i) 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three Business Days prior to the
proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of a Eurodollar Auction or (ii) 10:00 a.m.
(Chicago time) on the proposed Borrowing Date, in the case of an Absolute Rate
Auction, the Borrower shall notify the Agent of the Borrower's acceptance or
rejection of the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.4.5; provided,
however, that the failure by the Borrower to give such notice to the Agent
shall be deemed to be a rejection by the Borrower of all such offers.  In the
case of acceptance, such notice (a "Competitive Bid Acceptance Notice") shall
specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that





Page 19
<PAGE>   26

are accepted.  The Borrower may accept or reject any Competitive Bid Quote in
whole or in part (subject to the terms of Section 2.4.4(b)(iv)); provided that:

(i)         the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid
Advance may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in
the related Competitive Bid Quote Request;

(ii)        acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of
ascending Competitive Bid Margins or Absolute Rates, as
the case may be; and

(iii)       the Borrower may not accept any offer of the type
described in Section 2.4.4(c) or that otherwise fails to
comply with the requirements of this Agreement for the
purpose of obtaining a Competitive Bid Loan under this
Agreement.

2.4.7.   Allocation by the Agent.  Subject to Section 2.4.6,
if offers are made by two or more Lenders with the same Competitive Bid Margins
or Absolute Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount
than the amount in respect of which offers are permitted to be accepted for the
related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in
respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among
such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such multiples as the Agent may deem
appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers;
provided, however, that no Lender shall be allocated a portion of any
Competitive Bid Advance which is less than the minimum amount which such Lender
has indicated that it is willing to accept.  Allocations by the Agent of the
amounts of Competitive Bid Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.  The Agent shall promptly, but in any event on the same Business Day in
the case of Eurodollar Bid Rate Advances, and by 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on
the same Business Day in the case of Absolute Rate Advances, notify each Lender
of its receipt of a Competitive Bid Acceptance Notice and the aggregate
principal amount of each Competitive Bid Advance allocated to each
participating Lender.

2.4.8.   Administration Fee.  The Borrower hereby agrees to
pay to the Agent, for its sole account, an administration fee of $1,000 per
Competitive Bid Quote Request transmitted by the Borrower to the Agent pursuant
to Section 2.4.2.  Such administration fee shall be payable in arrears on each
Payment Date and on the Termination Date for any period then ending for which
such fee, if any, shall not have been theretofore paid.

2.5.   Method of Borrowing.  Not later than 12:00 noon (Chicago time)
on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans, if
any, in funds immediately available to the Agent, in Chicago, Illinois at its
address specified





Page 20
<PAGE>   27

pursuant to Article XIII.  The Agent will make the funds so received from the
Lenders available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5, to the extent
that a Loan made by a Lender matures on the Borrowing Date of a requested Loan,
such Lender shall apply the proceeds of the Loan it is then making to the
repayment of principal of the maturing Loan.

2.6.   Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay the following fees:

2.6.1.  Facility Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent
for the account of each Lender, for the period from the Closing Date to and
including the Termination Date, a facility fee equal to the product of (i) such
Lender's Commitment (whether used or unused), and (ii) the amount (expressed in
basis points per annum) specified as the Applicable Margin for facility fees
pursuant to Section 2.3.4(i), payable on each Payment Date and on the
Termination Date.

2.6.2.  Usage Fee.        In the event that during any
calendar quarter, the average daily principal amount of the Loans outstanding
is greater than $62,500,000, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of each Lender a usage fee equal to 5 basis points per annum on the
average daily principal amount of the Loans outstanding during such quarter,
payable on each Payment Date and on the Termination Date.

2.6.3.  Agent's Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Agent, for its own account, the fees agreed to by the Borrower and the Agent
pursuant to that certain Letter Agreement dated June 28, 1995.

2.7.    Reductions in Aggregate Commitment; Principal Payments.

2.7.1.   Reductions in Aggregate Commitment.  The Borrower may
permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in part ratably among
the Lenders in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (and multiples of
$500,000 in excess thereof), upon at least three Business Days' written notice
to the Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction;
provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Commitment may not be
reduced below the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Advances.

2.7.2.   Principal Payments.

(i)  Optional Payments.  The Borrower may from time to time
pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate
Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 (and
multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof), any portion of the
outstanding Floating Rate Advances upon one Business Days'





Page 21
<PAGE>   28

prior notice to the Agent.  A Fixed Rate Advance may not be paid prior
to the last day of the applicable Interest Period.

(ii) Termination.  Any outstanding Advances and all other unpaid
Obligations shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the Termination
Date.

2.8.    Changes in Interest Rate, etc.  Each Floating Rate Advance
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day
from and including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a
Eurodollar Committed Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section
2.3.6 to but excluding the date it becomes due or is converted into a
Eurodollar Committed Advance pursuant to Section 2.3.6 hereof, at a rate per
annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day.  Changes in the rate of interest
on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take
effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate.  Each Fixed
Rate Advance shall bear interest from and including the first day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such
Interest Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such Fixed
Rate Advance.  No Interest Period may end after the Termination Date.

2.9.  Rates Applicable After Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 2.3.5 or 2.3.6, during the continuance of a
Default or Unmatured Default, the Required Lenders may, at their option, by
notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no
Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Committed
Advance.  During the continuance of a Default, the Required Lenders may, at
their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the
option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2
requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates),
declare that (i) each Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest for the remainder
of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such
Interest Period plus 2% per annum and (ii) each Floating Rate Advance shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate plus 2% per annum.

2.10.   Method of Payment.  Subject to the last sentence of Section
2.5, all payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without setoff,
deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the Agent at the
Agent's address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending
Installation of the Agent specified in writing by the Agent to the Borrower, by
noon (local time) on the date when due and shall be applied ratably by the
Agent among all Lenders in the case of fees and payments in respect of
Committed Advances and ratably among the applicable Lenders in respect of
Competitive Bid Advances.  Each payment





Page 22
<PAGE>   29

delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered
promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent
received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending
Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender.  The
Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower maintained
with First Chicago for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it
becomes due hereunder.

2.11.   Notes; Telephonic Notices.  Each Lender is hereby authorized
to record the principal amount of each of its Loans and each repayment on the
schedule attached to its Notes; provided, however, that the failure to so
record shall not affect the Borrower's obligations under any Loan Document.
The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or
continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances, transfer funds and
submit Competitive Bid Quotes, in each case based on telephonic notices made by
any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be
acting on behalf of the Borrower.  The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the
Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer.
If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action
taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders
shall govern absent manifest error.

2.12.   Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis.  Interest
accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date
on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or
otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance shall
be payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on
which the Fixed Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or
otherwise, and at maturity.  Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Advance having
an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last
day of each three-month interval (in the case of Eurodollar Committed Advances
or Eurodollar Bid Rate Advances) or 90-day interval (in the case of Absolute
Rate Advances) during such Interest Period.  Interest and fees shall be
calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year.  Interest
shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any
payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at
the place of payment.  If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance
shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal
payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment.





Page 23
<PAGE>   30

2.13.   Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and
Commitment Reductions.  Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice,
Committed Borrowing Notice, Competitive Bid Acceptance Notice,
Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.
The Agent will notify each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Fixed
Rate Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give
each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.

2.14.   Lending Installations.  Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time.  All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and the Notes shall be deemed held by each Lender for
the benefit of such Lending Installation.  Each Lender may, by written or telex
notice to the Agent and the Borrower, designate a Lending Installation through
which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be
made.

2.15.   Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent.  Unless the Borrower or a
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal,
interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not
intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been
made.  The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such
payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption.
If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such
payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the
Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest
thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such
amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers
such amount at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of payment by a
Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day or (ii) in the case of
payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

2.16.   Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five Business Days prior
to the first date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the
account of any Lender, each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver
to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United
States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 (or a successor form),
certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments
under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes.  Each Lender which so delivers a Form 1001
or 4224 further undertakes to deliver to each





Page 24
<PAGE>   31

of the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies of such form (or a
successor form) on or before the date that such form expires (currently, three
successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one calendar year for Form 4224) or
becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions
or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is entitled to receive payments
under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without
limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the
date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all
such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing
and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender advises the
Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any
deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

2.17.   Extension of Termination Date.

2.17.1. Extension Procedures.  The Commitment of each Lender,
and this Agreement as between such Lender and the Borrower, may be extended for
one period of one year upon mutual agreement of such Lender and the Borrower in
the manner provided in this Section 2.17, to the effect that the Termination
Date with respect to such Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and the
Notes shall be extended by one year to August 7, 2000.  The request for such an
extension shall be made by the Borrower in writing and delivered to the Agent
no later than 60 days but not sooner than 90 days prior to the second
anniversary of this Agreement.  Promptly following the Agent's receipt of any
such request, the Agent shall notify each Lender thereof.  Each Lender may, in
its sole discretion, agree to such extension by giving written notice of such
agreement to the Agent and the Borrower within 30 days following the Borrower's
request for such extension (each Lender which so consents to a requested
extension is herein called a "Consenting Lender" and each Lender which does not
so consent to a requested extension is herein called a "Non-consenting
Lender").  If any Lender fails to respond to any such request, such Lender
shall be deemed to be a Non-consenting Lender.  If Consenting Lenders hold 66
2/3% or more of the Aggregate Commitment, then the Termination Date of each
Consenting Lender shall be so extended and the Termination Date of each
Non-consenting Lender, if any, shall remain unchanged.  If Consenting Lenders
hold less than 66 2/3% of the Aggregate Commitment, then the Termination Date
shall not be extended for any of the Lenders.

2.17.2.  Termination of Lenders.  If there are any
Non-consenting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.17.1 and an extension has occurred
for Consenting Lenders, the Borrower may, at its option, terminate the
Commitment of a Non-consenting Lender and pay or





Page 25
<PAGE>   32

prepay all outstanding Loans of such Non-consenting Lender (each a "Terminated
Lender").  The Borrower shall, by giving written notice thereof to the
Terminated Lender and to the Agent, specify the proposed effective date of
termination of the Terminated Lender's Commitment (the "Lender Termination
Date"), which date shall not in any event be less than five nor more than
thirty days following the date of such notice of termination.  The Borrower may
not elect to terminate and prepay any Lender under this Section 2.17.2 if a
Default or Unmatured Default exists.  On the Lender Termination Date (i) the
Borrower shall pay or prepay all outstanding Loans of such Terminated Lender,
together with accrued interest thereon and all fees due such Terminated Lender
under this Agreement, in each case accrued through the Lender Termination Date,
together with all amounts, if any, payable under Section 3.4 in connection with
prepayment of such Loans, and (ii) the Terminated Lender shall have no further
Commitment under this Agreement and shall no longer be a "Lender" under this
Agreement for any purpose except insofar as it shall be entitled to any payment
or indemnification, or be obligated to make any indemnification, on account of
any event which shall have occurred, or any right or liability which shall have
arisen, on or prior to the date of repayment in full of such Loans.  The
termination of any Terminated Lender's Commitment and the prepayment of a
Terminated Lender's Loans pursuant to this Section 2.17.2 shall not relieve or
satisfy the obligations of the Borrower to make any such prepayments free and
clear of all taxes, to reimburse such Terminated Lender for all increased costs
pursuant to Section 3.4, or to comply with all other terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 9.7).

2.17.3.  Successor Lenders.  If, from time to time, any
Non-consenting Lender's Commitment is terminated pursuant to Section 2.17.2,
the Borrower may, at its option, specify one or more commercial banks
(including any Lender) (each a "Successor Lender"), each of which Successor
Lenders (i) shall be acceptable to the Agent, (ii) have a combined capital,
surplus (or its equivalent) and undivided profits in an amount not less than
U.S. $250,000,000 (or its equivalent in another currency), and (iii)  shall
have agreed, in the aggregate, to succeed to the entire Commitment of such
Terminated Lender on the applicable Lender Termination Date.  Effective as of
such Lender Termination Date, the Borrower, the Agent and such Successor Lender
shall enter into an appropriate Assignment Agreement to so assign the entire
Commitment of the applicable Terminated Lender to the Successor Lender.

ARTICLE III

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES


3.1.   Yield Protection.  If any law or any governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or
not having the force of law), or any interpretation thereof, or the compliance
of any Lender therewith,

(i)         subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
to any tax, duty, charge or withholding on or from
payments due from the Borrower (excluding federal taxation
of the overall net income of any Lender or applicable
Lending Installation, income taxes imposed on any Lender
in the jurisdiction in which such Lender's home office is
located, and the Illinois personal property replacement
tax), or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any
Lender in respect of its Loans or other amounts due it
hereunder, or

(ii)        imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any
applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and
assessments taken into account in determining the interest
rate applicable to Fixed Rate Advances), or

(iii)       imposes any other condition the result of which is to
increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending
Installation of making, funding or maintaining loans or
reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any
applicable Lending Installation in connection with loans,
or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending
Installation to make any payment calculated by reference
to the amount of loans held or interest received by it, by
an amount deemed material by such Lender,

then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender pursuant to the written statement
required under Section 3.5, the Borrower shall pay such Lender that portion of
such increased expense incurred or reduction in an amount received which such
Lender determines is attributable to making, funding and maintaining its Loans
and its Commitment. Each Lender will notify the Borrower of any event occurring
after the date of this Agreement which will entitle such Lender to compensation
pursuant to this Section 3.1, as promptly as practicable after such Lender
obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation.

3.2.   Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations.  If a Lender
reasonably determines the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change, then,
within 15 days of demand by such Lender pursuant to the written statement
required under Section 3.5, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount
necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion
of such increased capital which such Lender reasonably determines is
attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its obligation to make Loans
hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's policies as to capital
adequacy).  "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in
the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines, or (ii) any adoption of or change in any
other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy,
guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation
or any corporation controlling any Lender.  "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines"
means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on
the date of this Agreement, including transition rules, and (ii) the
corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside
the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on
Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled "International
Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards," including
transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the
date of this Agreement.  Each Lender will notify the Borrower of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle such Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 3.2, as promptly as practicable after
such Lender obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such
compensation.

3.3.   Availability of Types of Advances.  If any Lender determines
that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation
would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or
not having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders (or in the case of any
Competitive Bid Loan, the Lender making such Loan) determine that (i) deposits
of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Fixed Rate Advances are not
available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to a Type of Advance does not
accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining such Advance, then the
Agent shall suspend the availability of the affected Type of Advance and
require any Fixed Rate Advances of the affected Type to be repaid.

3.4.   Funding Indemnification.  If any payment of a Fixed Rate
Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest
Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Fixed
Rate Advance is not made, continued or converted on the date specified by the
Borrower for





Page 28
<PAGE>   35

any reason other than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will indemnify each
Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including,
without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits
acquired to fund or maintain the Fixed Rate Advance.

3.5.   Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent
reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending
Installation with respect to its Fixed Rate Loans to reduce any liability of
the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 or to avoid the
unavailability of a Type of Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such
designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Lender shall deliver a
written statement of such Lender as to the amount due, if any, under Sections
3.1, 3.2 or 3.4.  Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail
the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.
Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Fixed
Rate Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Fixed Rate Loan
through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the
deposit used as a reference in determining the Fixed Rate applicable to such
Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided
herein, the amount specified in the written statement shall be payable on
demand after receipt by the Borrower of the written statement.  The obligations
of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 shall survive payment of the
Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

duly incorporated or organized, as applicable, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its
business is conducted, except where such failure to obtain all requisite
authority would not, with respect to any individual failure or any failures in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.2.   Authorization and Validity.  The Borrower has the corporate
power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents
and to perform its obligations thereunder.  The execution and delivery by the
Borrower of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations

5.3.   No Conflict; Government Consent.  Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles of incorporation or by-laws or the

any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its
Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of
the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
instrument or agreement.  No order, consent, approval, license, authorization,

Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service
through the fiscal year ended December 31, 1991.  No tax liens have been filed
and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes.  The charges,

Section 180.0622(2)(b).

respects with all applicable requirements of law and regulations and no

nor any other member of the Controlled Group has incurred or reasonably expects
to incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Plan (other
than premiums due under Section 4007 of ERISA).

5.10.   Accuracy of Information.  No information, exhibit or report
furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or to any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan
Documents contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a
material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein
not misleading.

which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction
hereunder.

regulations, orders and restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or
any instrumentality or agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of
their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective Property,
except where any individual noncompliance or any noncompliance in the aggregate
would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary has received any notice to the effect that its operations are not in
material compliance with any of the requirements of applicable federal, state
and local environmental, health and safety statutes and regulations or the
subject of any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial
action is needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or
substance into the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could
have a Material Adverse Effect.

remain duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing as a domestic
corporation in its jurisdiction of incorporation and maintain all requisite
authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is

the Lenders may designate; provided, however, that, unless a Default or

will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, make any Acquisition of any

generally accepted principles of accounting shall have been
set aside on its books.

(ii)    Liens imposed by law, such as carriers', warehousemen's
and mechanics' liens and other similar liens arising in the

ARTICLE VIII

ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES


8.1.   Acceleration.  If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7
occurs with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make
Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part
of the Agent or any Lender.  If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders
may terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder, or declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon
the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby
expressly waives.

If, within fourteen (14) days after acceleration of the maturity of
the Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in
Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Borrower) and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or
entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the
Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration
and/or termination.

8.2.   Amendments.  Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII,
the Required Lenders (or the Agent with the consent in writing of the Required
Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing
in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving
any Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement
shall, without the consent of each Lender affected thereby:

(i)     Extend the maturity of any Loan or Note or forgive all or any
portion of the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or
extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon.





Page 45
<PAGE>   52

(ii)    Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required
Lenders.

(iii)    Extend the Termination Date, or increase the amount of the
Commitment of any Lender hereunder, or permit the Borrower to
assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement.

(iv)    Amend this Section 8.2.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent shall be
effective without the written consent of the Agent.  The Agent may waive
payment of the fee required under Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent
of any other party to this Agreement.

8.3.   Preservation of Rights.  No delay or omission of the Lenders
or the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein,
and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the
inability of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan
shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence.  Any single or partial
exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation
of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall
be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section
8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.  All
remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative
and all shall be available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations
have been paid in full.


ARTICLE IX

overall net income of any Lender, income taxes imposed on any





Page 46
<PAGE>   53

Lender in the jurisdiction in which such Lender's home office is located, and
the Illinois personal property replacement tax) or other similar assessments or
charges made by any governmental or revenue authority in respect of the Loan
Documents shall be paid by the Borrower, together with interest and penalties,
if any.

9.4.   Headings.  Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any
of the provisions of the Loan Documents.

9.5.   Entire Agreement.  The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the Borrower, the Agent
and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof.

9.6.   Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement.  The
respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and
no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to
which the Agent is authorized to act as such).  The failure of any Lender to
perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender
from any of its obligations hereunder.  This Agreement shall not be construed
so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.

9.7.   Expenses; Indemnification.  Subject to the Letter Agreement,
dated June 28, 1995, between the Borrower and the Agent, the Borrower shall
reimburse the Agent for any costs, internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses
(including attorneys' fees and time charges of attorneys for the Agent, which
attorneys may be employees of the Agent) paid or incurred by the Agent in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, review,
amendment, modification, and administration of the Loan Documents.  The
Borrower also agrees to reimburse the Agent and the Lenders for any costs,
internal charges and out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees and time
charges of attorneys for the Agent and the Lenders, which attorneys may be
employees of the Agent or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Agent or any
Lender in connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents.
The Borrower further agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, its
directors, officers and employees (each an "Indemnified Party") against all
losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation
therefor whether or not the Agent or any Lender is a party thereto) which any
Indemnified Party may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or
the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of
any Loan hereunder, except that any such Indemnified Party shall not be
indemnified for any such losses, claims,





Page 47
<PAGE>   54

damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses to the extent that they
arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Party.  The obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with

statements and reports referred to in Section 6.1(iv) for the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 1995.

9.10.   Severability of Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan
Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or
invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

9.11.   Nonliability of Lenders.  The relationship between the
Borrower and the Lenders and the Agent shall be solely that of borrower and
lender.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary
responsibilities to the Borrower.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender undertakes
any responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any
matter in connection with any phase of the Borrower's business or operations.

9.12.   CHOICE OF LAW.  THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE
CONTAINING A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE
OF ILLINOIS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

9.13.   CONSENT TO JURISDICTION.  THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR
ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT

PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN
DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

9.14.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND EACH LENDER

WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

Borrower or any Lender by reason of this Agreement.

Page 49
<PAGE>   56

10.3.   General Immunity.  Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, the Lenders or

for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

10.4.   No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc.  Neither the Agent
nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible
for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (i) any statement,

borrowing hereunder; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants
or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without

creation, perfection or priority of any interest in any collateral security.
The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not
required to be furnished by the Borrower to the Agent at such time, but is
voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the Agent (either in its capacity as
Agent or in its individual capacity).

10.5.   Action on Instructions of Lenders.  The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by
the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders and on all holders
of Notes.  The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all
liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing
to take any such action.

to rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
telegram, statement, paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct

respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent,
which counsel may be employees of the Agent.

10.8.   Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification.  The Lenders agree
to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which the
Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents,
(ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and
enforcement of the Loan Documents and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations,

disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith
or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of the
terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent.  The obligations of the Lenders
under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and

Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is
a Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its
individual capacity.  The Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in
addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such
Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.  The
Agent, in its individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.

10.l0.  Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time,





Page 51
<PAGE>   58

continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

10.11.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of
its intention to resign. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Agent's giving notice
of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of
the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor Agent.  If the Agent has resigned and
no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties
of the Agent hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of
the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal
directly with the Lenders.  No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed
hereunder until such successor Agent has accepted the appointment.  Any such
successor Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings
of at least $250,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
resigning Agent.  Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the
resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder
and under the Loan Documents.  After the effectiveness of the resignation of an
Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.

10.12.  Co-Agents.  None of the Lenders identified in this Agreement
or any other Loan Document as a "Co-Agent" shall have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.  Each Lender
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders
so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or in taking or refraining from taking any action hereunder or
thereunder or pursuant hereto or thereto.

ARTICLE XI

SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS


11.1.   Setoff.  In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights
of the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default or Unmatured Default occurs, any and all deposits
(including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or
not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or
owing by any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be
offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender,
whether or not the Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due.

11.2.   Ratable Payments.  If any Lender, whether by setoff or
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received
pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.4) in a greater proportion than that
received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such
purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans.  If any Lender,
whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff
or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or
such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans.  In case any
such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.


ARTICLE XII

BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS


12.1.   Successors and Assigns.  The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and
the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3.  Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section, any Lender may
at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the Agent, assign all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Notes to a Federal
Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment shall release the
transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.  The Agent may treat the
payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until
such





Page 53
<PAGE>   60

payee complies with Section 12.3 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in
the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with
the Agent.  Any assignee or transferee of a Note agrees by acceptance thereof
to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any
request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such
request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any Note, shall be
conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such
Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

12.2.   Participations.

12.2.1.  Permitted Participants; Effect.  Any Lender may, in
the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable
law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities
("Participants") participating interests in any Loan owing to such
Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or
any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents.  In the
event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a
Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such
Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes under
the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this
Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such
participating interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

12.2.2.  Voting Rights.  Each Lender shall retain the sole
right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan
Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with
respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an
interest which forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the
interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan or
Commitment, postpones any date fixed for any regularly-scheduled
payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such Loan or
Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases any
substantial portion of collateral, if any, securing any such Loan.

12.2.3.  Benefit of Setoff.  The Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in
Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing
under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the
Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of
setoff





Page 54
<PAGE>   61

provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating
interests sold to each Participant.  The Lenders agree to share with
each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of
setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any
amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such
amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each
Participant were a Lender.

12.3.   Assignments.

12.3.1.  Permitted Assignments.  Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law,
at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities
("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and obligations under the
Loan Documents.  Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of
Exhibit "H" hereto or in such other form as may be agreed to by the
parties thereto.  The consent of the Borrower and the Agent, which
consent in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld, shall be
required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a
Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof; provided,
however, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent
of the Borrower shall not be required.

12.3.2.  Effect; Effective Date.  Upon (i) delivery to the
Agent of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit "I" to Exhibit "H" hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together
with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a
$2,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment, such
assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in
such Notice of Assignment.  The Notice of Assignment shall contain a
representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the
consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans
under the applicable assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined
under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and
under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA.  On
and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall
for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other
Loan Document executed by the Lenders and shall have all the rights
and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same
extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further consent
or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent shall be required
to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the
Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser.  Upon the
consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section
12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall make
appropriate arrangements so that replacement Notes are issued





Page 55
<PAGE>   62

to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate,
replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in
principal amounts reflecting their Commitment, as adjusted pursuant to
such assignment.

12.4.   Dissemination of Information.  The Borrower authorizes each
Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser, which, if required pursuant
to Section 12.3.1, the Borrower has consented to in accordance with the terms
thereof, or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by
operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and
all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries; provided that each Transferee and
prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.15 of this Agreement.

12.5.   Tax Treatment.  If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 2.16.


ARTICLE XIII

NOTICES

13.1.   Giving Notice.  Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.11
with respect to borrowing notices, all notices and other communications
provided to any party hereto under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall be in writing or by telex or by facsimile and addressed or delivered to
such party at its address set forth below its signature hereto or at such other
address as may be designated by such party in a notice to the other parties.
Any notice, if mailed and properly addressed with postage prepaid, shall be
deemed given when received; any notice, if transmitted by telex or facsimile,
shall be deemed given when transmitted (answerback confirmed in the case of
telexes).

13.2.   Change of Address.  The Borrower, the Agent and any Lender may
each change the address for service of notice upon it by a notice in writing to
the other parties hereto.


ARTICLE XIV

COUNTERPARTS

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart.  This
Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the
Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Agent by telex or
telephone, that it has taken such action.

FORM OF OPINION

August 8, 1995

To:      The Agent and the Lenders who are parties to the Credit Agreement
described below.


Gentlemen/Ladies:

I am counsel for Firstar Corporation (the Borrower"), and have
represented the Borrower in connection with its execution and delivery of a
Credit Agreement among the Borrower, The First National Bank of Chicago,
individually and as Agent, Bank of America National Trust and Savings
Association, Chemical Bank and NBD Bank, as Co-Agents and the Lenders named
therein, providing for Advances in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding
$125,000,000 at any one time outstanding and dated as of August 8, 1995 (the
"Agreement").  All capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement.

We have examined the Borrower's articles of incorporation, by-laws,
resolutions, the Loan Documents and such other matters of fact and law which we
deem necessary in order to render this opinion.  Based upon the foregoing, it
is our opinion that:

l.      Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or
a national or state banking association duly incorporated or organized, as
applicable, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite authority to conduct its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted, except where
such failure to obtain all requisite authority would not, with respect to any
individual failure or any failures in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

2.      The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the
Borrower and the performance by the Borrower of the Obligations have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action and proceedings on the part of the
Borrower and will not:

(a)  require any consent of the Borrower's shareholders;

(b)  violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles of
incorporation or by-laws or any indenture, instrument or agreement
binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; or





Page 69
<PAGE>   76


(c)  result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any
Lien pursuant to the provisions of any indenture, instrument or
agreement binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

3.      The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by
the Borrower and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Borrower enforceable in accordance with their terms except to the extent the
enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject also to
the availability of equitable remedies if equitable remedies are sought.

4.      There is no litigation or proceeding against the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, could have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.      No approval, authorization, consent, adjudication or order of
any governmental authority, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents, the borrowings under the Agreement or in connection with the payment
by the Borrower of the Obligations.

This opinion may be relied upon by the Agent, the Lenders and their
participants, assignees and other transferees.

Very truly yours,

EXHIBIT "H"

ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

This Assignment Agreement (this "Assignment Agreement") between
__________________________ (the "Assignor") and __________________ (the
"Assignee") is dated as of _________________, 19__.  The parties hereto agree
as follows:


1.  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.  The Assignor is a party to a Credit
Agreement (which, as it may be amended, modified, renewed or extended from time
to time is herein called the "Credit Agreement") described in Item 1 of Schedule
1 attached hereto ("Schedule 1"). Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in  the
Credit Agreement.


2.  ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION.  The Assignor hereby sells and assigns
to the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the
Assignor, an interest in and to the Assignor's rights and obligations under the
Credit Agreement such that after giving effect to such assignment the Assignee
shall have purchased pursuant to this Assignment Agreement the percentage
interest specified in Item 3 of Schedule 1 of all outstanding rights and
obligations under the Credit Agreement relating to the facilities listed in Item
3 of Schedule 1 and the other Loan Documents.  The aggregate Commitment (or
Loans, if the applicable Commitment has been terminated) purchased by the
Assignee hereunder is set forth in Item 4 of Schedule 1.


3.      EFFECTIVE DATE.  The effective date of this Assignment
Agreement (the "Effective Date") shall be the later of the date specified in
Item 5 of Schedule 1 or two Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by
the Agent) after a Notice of Assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit "I"
attached hereto has been delivered to the Agent.  Such Notice of Assignment must
include any consents required to be delivered to the Agent by Section [12.3.1]
of the Credit Agreement.  In no event will the Effective Date occur if the
payments required to be made by the Assignee to the Assignor on the Effective
Date under Sections 4 and 5 hereof are not made on the proposed Effective Date.
The Assignor will notify the Assignee of the proposed Effective Date no later
than the Business Day prior to the proposed Effective Date.  As of the Effective
Date, (i) the Assignee shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
the Loan Documents with respect to the rights and obligations assigned to the
Assignee hereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall relinquish its rights and be
released from its corresponding obligations under the Loan Documents with
respect to the rights and obligations assigned to the Assignee hereunder.


4.  PAYMENTS OBLIGATIONS.  On and after the Effective Date, the
Assignee shall be entitled to receive from the Agent all





Page 76
<PAGE>   83

payments of principal, interest and fees with respect to the interest assigned
hereby.  The Assignee shall advance funds directly to the Agent with respect to
all Loans and reimbursement payments made on or after the Effective Date with
respect to the interest assigned hereby.  [In consideration for the sale and
assignment of Loans hereunder, (i) the Assignee shall pay the Assignor, on the
Effective Date, an amount equal to the principal amount of the portion of all
Floating Rate Loans assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) with respect to
each Fixed Rate Loan made by the Assignor and assigned to the Assignee hereunder
which is outstanding on the Effective Date, (a) on the last day of the Interest
Period therefor or (b) on such earlier date agreed to by the Assignor and the
Assignee or (c) on the date on which any such Fixed Rate Loan either becomes due
(by acceleration or otherwise) or is prepaid (the date as described in the
foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c) being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment
Date"), the Assignee shall pay the Assignor an amount equal to the principal
amount of the portion of such Fixed Rate Loan assigned to the Assignee which is
outstanding on the Payment Date.  If the Assignor and the Assignee agree that
the Payment Date for such Fixed Rate Loan shall be the Effective Date, they
shall agree to the interest rate applicable to the portion of such Loan assigned
hereunder for the period from the Effective Date to the end of the existing
Interest Period applicable to such Fixed Rate Loan (the "Agreed Interest Rate")
and any interest received by the Assignee in excess of the Agreed Interest Rate
shall be remitted to the Assignor.  In the event interest for the period from
the Effective Date to but not including the Payment Date is not paid by the
Borrower with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan sold by the Assignor to the
Assignee hereunder, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor interest for such
period on the portion of such Fixed Rate Loan sold by the Assignor to the
Assignee hereunder at the applicable rate provided by the Credit Agreement.  In
the event a prepayment of any Fixed Rate Loan which is existing on the Payment
Date and assigned by the Assignor to the Assignee hereunder occurs after the
Payment Date but before the end of the Interest Period applicable to such Fixed
Rate Loan, the Assignee shall remit to the Assignor the excess of the prepayment
penalty paid with respect to the portion of such Fixed Rate Loan assigned to the
Assignee hereunder over the amount which would have been paid if such prepayment
penalty was calculated based on the Agreed Interest Rate.  The Assignee will
also promptly remit to the Assignor (i) any principal payments received from the
Agent with respect to Fixed Rate Loans prior to the Payment Date and (ii) any
amounts of interest on Loans and fees received from the Agent which relate to
the portion of the Loans assigned to the Assignee hereunder for periods prior to
the Effective Date, in the case of Floating Rate Loans or fees, or the Payment
Date, in the case of Fixed Rate Loans, and not previously paid by the Assignee
to the Assignor.]*******  In the event that either party hereto receives any
payment to which the other party






*******Each Assignor may insert its standard payment provisions in lieu of
the payment terms included in this Exhibit.


Page 77
<PAGE>   84

hereto is entitled under this Assignment Agreement, then the party receiving
such amount shall promptly remit it to the other party hereto.

5.  FEES PAYABLE BY THE ASSIGNEE.  The Assignee shall pay to the
Assignor a fee on each day on which a payment of interest or [commitment] fees
is made under the Credit Agreement with respect to the amounts assigned to the
Assignee hereunder (other than a payment of interest or facility fees for the
period prior to the Effective Date or, in the case of Fixed Rate Loans, the
Payment Date, which the Assignee is obligated to deliver to the Assignor
pursuant to Section 4 hereof).  The amount of such fee shall be the difference
between (i) the interest or fee, as applicable, paid with respect to the amounts
assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) the interest or fee, as applicable,
which would have been paid with respect to the amounts assigned to the Assignee
hereunder if each interest rate was ___ of 1%  less than the interest rate paid
by the Borrower or if the facility fee was ___ of 1% less than the facility fee
paid by the Borrower, as applicable.  In addition, the Assignee agrees to pay
___% of the recordation fee required to be paid to the Agent in connection
with this Assignment Agreement.


6.  REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ASSIGNOR; LIMITATIONS ON THE ASSIGNOR'S
LIABILITY.  The Assignor represents and warrants that it is the legal and
beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder and that such
interest is free and clear of any adverse claim created by the Assignor.  It is
understood and agreed that the assignment and assumption hereunder are made
without recourse to the Assignor and that the Assignor makes no other
representation or warranty of any kind to the Assignee.  Neither the Assignor

security interest in assets of the Borrower or any guarantor, (ii) any
representation, warranty or statement made in or in connection with any of the
Loan Documents, (iii) the financial condition or creditworthiness of the
Borrower or any guarantor, (iv) the performance of or compliance with any of the
terms or provisions of any of the Loan Documents, (v) inspecting any of the
Property, books or records of the Borrower, (vi) the validity, enforceability,

or purporting to secure the Loans or (vii) any mistake, error of judgment, or
action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with the Loans or the Loan
Documents.


7.      REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ASSIGNEE.  The Assignee (i) confirms
that it has received a copy of the Credit Agreement, together with copies of the
financial statements requested by the Assignee and such other documents and

into this Assignment Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will, independently and

such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under

Loan Documents are required to be performed by it as a Lender, (v) agrees that
its payment instructions and notice instructions are as set forth in the

interests in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under
ERISA, [and (vii) attaches the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service of the United States certifying that the Assignee is entitled to receive
payments under the Loan Documents without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes].*

8.  INDEMNITY.  The Assignee agrees to indemnify and hold the Assignor
harmless against any and all losses, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) and liabilities incurred by the Assignor
in connection with or arising in any manner from the Assignee's non-performance
of the obligations assumed under this Assignment Agreement.


9.  SUBSEQUENT ASSIGNMENTS.  After the Effective Date, the Assignee
shall have the right pursuant to Section [12.3.1] of the Credit Agreement to

the terms of the Loan Documents has been obtained and (ii) unless the prior
written consent of the Assignor is obtained, the Assignee is not thereby
released from its obligations to the Assignor hereunder, if any remain

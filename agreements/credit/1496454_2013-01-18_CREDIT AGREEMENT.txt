3.
PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC.


3.1        Default Rate.    Notwithstanding any provision herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Interest Rate payable on the Loans shall be the Default Rate.
3.2        Payments Under Bank Swap Documents.    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
or any other Loan Document to the contrary, if all or any portion of any Loan is subject to a Bank Swap Document, and such Bank Swap Document provides for a payment schedule for principal and interest contrary to the provisions of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document, the payment schedule set forth in such Bank Swap Document shall govern with respect to that portion of such Loan subject to such Bank Swap Document.

3.3         Late
Payments.    If any scheduled payment, whether principal, interest, or principal and interest, is late twelve (12) days or more, Borrower agrees to pay a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount of the
payment which is late, but not more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable Laws nor less than $10.00. The foregoing provision shall not be deemed to excuse a late payment or be deemed a waiver of any other rights Bank may have under this
Agreement, including, subject to the terms hereof, the right to declare the entire unpaid principal and interest immediately due and payable.
3.4        Payment to Bank.
(A)        All sums payable to Bank under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document shall be paid directly to Bank in immediately available funds or by good
check at the Place for Payment. If Bank shall send Borrower statements of amounts due hereunder, such statements shall be considered correct and conclusively binding on Borrower unless Borrower notifies Bank to the contrary within thirty
(30) days of its receipt of any statement which it deems to be incorrect.

(B)        All payments to be made by Borrower hereunder will be made to Bank
not later than 2:00 p.m. at the Place for Payment on the date payment is due. Payments received after 2:00 p.m. at the Place for Payment shall be deemed to be payments made prior to 2:00 p.m. at the Place for Payment on the next succeeding Business
Day.
(C)        Bank shall charge against any deposit account of
Borrower all or any part of any amount owed by Borrower hereunder, and Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to charge Borrower's accounts with Bank in order to cause timely payment of amounts due hereunder to be made (subject to sufficient funds being
available in such account for that purpose).
(D)        At the time
of making each such payment, Borrower shall, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, specify to Bank the Loan or other


25










obligation of Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied. In the event that Borrower fails to so specify the relevant Loan or if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Bank may apply such payments as it may determine in its discretion.

3.5        Prepayment.
Borrower may prepay the principal of the Loans in whole or, from time to time, in part, without premium or penalty. In the case of any partial prepayment, Bank shall have the right to require and shall permit the remaining principal balance to
be re-amortized over the remaining term of the applicable Loan. All partial prepayments, whether voluntary or mandatory, shall (except as may be directed by Borrower to the contrary) be applied against the next principal payment of the applicable
Loan next coming due and in the inverse order of maturity, and no prepayment shall entitle Borrower to cease making any payment as otherwise scheduled hereunder.

3.6        No Setoff or
Deduction.    All payments of principal and interest on the Loans and other amounts payable by Borrower hereunder shall be made by Borrower without setoff or counterclaim, and, subject to the next succeeding sentence, free
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments, or other charges of whatever nature, imposed by any Governmental Authority. If any such taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges are imposed on any such payments, Borrower will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that payment of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts payable hereunder, after
withholding or deduction for or on account thereof, will not be less than any amount provided to be paid hereunder and, in any such case, Borrower will furnish to Bank certified copies of all tax receipts evidencing the payment of such amounts
within thirty (30)
days after the date any such payment is due pursuant to applicable Laws.
3.7
Payment on Non-Business Day; Payment Computations.    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement to the contrary, whenever any installment of principal of, or interest on, any Loan or other amount due hereunder becomes
due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any installment of principal, interest shall be payable thereon at the rate per annum determined in
accordance with this Agreement during such extension.

3.8        Additional Costs.

(A)        In the event that any applicable Law now or hereafter in effect and
whether or not presently applicable to Bank, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Bank with any guideline, request or directive of
any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall (i) affect the basis of taxation of payments to Bank of any amounts payable by Borrower under this Agreement (other than taxes imposed on the income of Bank), or
(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by Bank, or (iii) shall


26










impose any other condition with respect to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Loan, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Bank of making, funding or
maintaining such Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum receivable by Bank thereon, then Borrower shall pay to Bank from time to time, within sixty (60) days after written request by Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate Bank for
such increased cost or reduced sum receivable to the extent Bank is not compensated therefor in the computation of the Interest Rate applicable to such Loan. A statement as to the amount of such increased cost or reduced sum receivable, prepared in
good faith and in reasonable detail by Bank and submitted by Bank to Borrower, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.

(B)        In the event that any applicable Law now or hereafter in effect and
whether or not presently applicable to Bank, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Bank with any guideline, request or directive of
any such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), including any risk-based capital guidelines, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by Bank (or any corporation controlling Bank)
and Bank determines that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of Bank's obligations hereunder and such increase has the effect of reducing the rate of return on Bank's (or such controlling corporation's) capital as
a consequence of such obligations hereunder to a level below that which Bank (or such controlling corporation) could have achieved but for such circumstances (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy), then Borrower
shall pay to Bank from time to time, within sixty (60) days after written request by Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate Bank (or such controlling corporation) for any increase in the amount of capital and reduced rate of return
which Bank reasonably determines to be allocable to the existence of such Bank's obligations hereunder. A statement as to the amount of such compensation, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by Bank shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes absent manifest error in computation.

3.9        Illegality and
Impossibility.    In the event that any applicable Law now or hereafter in effect and whether or not presently applicable to Bank, or any interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Bank with any guideline, request or directive of such Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), including without limitation exchange controls, shall make it unlawful
or impossible for Bank to maintain any Loan under this Agreement, Borrower shall upon receipt of notice thereof from Bank repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of such Loan, together with all accrued interest thereon to the date of
payment and all amounts owing to Bank, (a) on a date no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after such notice, if Bank may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan for such period, or (b) immediately if Bank may not continue to
maintain such Loan to such day.

3.10        360-Day
Year.    All interest payable under the Notes shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year by multiplying the outstanding principal amount by the applicable per annum rate, multiplying the product thereof by the actual
number of days elapsed, and dividing the product so obtained by 360.


27










3.11        Indemnification.
If Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Loan on any other date than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or if Borrower fails to borrow any Advance after notice has been given to Bank in accordance
with this Agreement, or if Borrower fails to make any payment of principal or interest in respect of any Loan when due, Borrower shall reimburse Bank on demand for any resulting loss or expense actually incurred by Bank, including without limitation
any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from a Third Party, whether or not Bank shall have funded or committed to fund such Advance. A statement as to the amount of such actual loss or expense (such as LIBOR breakage
costs), prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by Bank will be submitted by Bank to Borrower, and shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation. Calculation of all amounts payable to Bank under this
Section shall be made as though Bank shall have actually funded or committed to fund the applicable Advance through the purchase of an underlying deposit in an amount equal to the amount of such Advance in the relevant market and having a maturity
comparable to the related Interest Period and through the transfer of such deposit to a domestic office of such Bank in the United States; provided, however, that Bank may fund the Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall
be utilized only for the purpose of calculation of amounts payable under this Section.

3.12        No Requirement to Actually Obtain Funds.    Notwithstanding the fact that the Interest Rate pursuant to the Loans may be calculated based upon Bank's cost of funds,
Borrower agrees that Bank shall not be required actually to obtain funds from such source at any time.

3.13        Usury Limitation.    If, at any time, the Interest Rate payable on the Loans shall be deemed by any competent court of law or any Governmental Authority to exceed the
maximum rate of interest permitted by any applicable Laws, then, for such time as the Interest Rate would be deemed excessive, its application shall be suspended and there shall be charged instead the maximum rate of interest permissible under such
Laws, and any excess interest actually collected by Bank shall be credited as a partial prepayment of principal.

contemplated by this Agreement.

The execution, delivery and performance of all of the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by all requisite action by Borrower. All of the Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered and constitute valid and binding obligations of
Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, and Bank will be entitled to the benefits of all of the Loan Documents.

6.4        Violations or Actions
Pending.    There are no actions, suits, or proceedings pending or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, threatened, which might have a Material Adverse Effect or which might impair the value of the Collateral. Borrower is
not in violation of any agreement the violation of which will or might reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and Borrower is not in violation of any order, judgment, or decree of any court, or any statute or governmental

provisions and accruals in respect of all such federal, state, local and other taxes, assessments and withholdings. There are no unpaid assessments pending against Borrower for any taxes or withholdings, and Borrower knows of no basis therefor.

6.7        Financial
Statements.    All financial statements of Borrower heretofore given and hereafter to be given to Bank are and will be true and complete in all material respects as of their respective dates and prepared in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and fairly represent and will fairly represent the financial conditions of Borrower, and no Material Adverse Change has or will have occurred in the financial conditions reflected therein after the
respective date thereof upon delivery to Bank, except as may be disclosed in writing to Bank.

Laws.    To the best of Borrower’s knowledge, except as disclosed in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessments approved by Bank with respect to the Projects, neither the Mortgaged Property nor Borrower is in violation
of or subject to any existing, pending or threatened investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Authority or any remedial obligations under any applicable Environmental Laws or Healthcare Laws, and there are no facts, conditions or circumstances
known to it which could result in any such investigation or inquiry if such facts, conditions and circumstances, if any, were fully disclosed to the applicable Governmental Authority, and Borrower will promptly notify Bank if Borrower becomes aware
of any such facts, conditions or circumstances or any such investigation or inquiry. Borrower has not obtained and is not required to obtain any Governmental Approvals to construct, occupy, operate or use any buildings, improvements, fixtures or
equipment in connection with the Mortgaged Property or Improvements constructed or to be constructed by reason of any Environmental Laws or Healthcare Laws. No Petroleum Products, Hazardous Substances or Solid Wastes have been disposed of or
released on the Mortgaged Property in violation of any applicable Environmental Laws, and Borrower covenants and agrees that it will not cause there to be any violation of any Environmental Laws or Healthcare Laws in connection with its ownership
and use of the Mortgaged Property, including any violation arising from the disposal or release of Petroleum Products, Hazardous Substances or Solid Wastes on the Mortgaged Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Borrower shall
indemnify and hold Bank harmless from and against any fines, charges, expenses, fees, Attorneys' Fees and costs incurred by Bank in the event Borrower or the Mortgaged Property (whether or not due to any fault of Borrower) is hereafter determined to
be in violation of any Environmental Laws or Healthcare Laws (excluding, however, any violation arising from circumstances occurring after the Environmental Indemnification Release Date, or any violation arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Bank), and this indemnity shall survive any foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and repayment of the Loans.

Property is in violation of any easements, covenants or restrictions affecting the Mortgaged Property.

6.14      Condemnation.    There are no proceedings pending, or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, threatened, to exercise any power of condemnation or eminent domain, with respect to

such financial statements or similar financial information so required be delivered).

(4)        No later than forty-five (45) days after each

the Loan Documents); (iv) hold itself out to the public as a legal entity separate and distinct from any other Person; (v) conduct business in its own name; (vi) not make any distributions that would cause it to fail to maintain

41










with such Project, Borrower will furnish or cause to be furnished to Bank financial information relating to the prospective tenant and any guarantors of such lease, and a draft of such lease and
any guaranties thereof (it being understood that Bank reserves the right to approve the creditworthiness of any such tenant and to require guaranties of any such lease), for Bank's approval prior to the execution of any such lease. Upon Bank's
approval of any such tenants, guarantors, leases and guaranties (if any), and after execution and delivery of any lease, Borrower will furnish or cause to be furnished to Bank a copy of the fully-executed lease and any applicable lease guaranties,
together with an estoppel certificate and a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement signed by each tenant thereunder, all such documentation to be in form and substance satisfactory to Bank. In addition, if required by Bank with

and taxes, tax, title and lien search charges, title insurance charges, architects', engineers' and Attorneys' Fees (including Attorneys' Fees at trial and on any appeal by either Borrower or Bank), real property taxes and insurance premiums.

(H)        Borrower will furnish promptly to Bank such information
as Bank may require concerning costs, marketing and such other factors as Bank may reasonably require; will notify Bank promptly of any litigation instituted or threatened against any Borrower Party which, if adversely determined, would give rise to
a Material Adverse Change, any deficiencies asserted or Liens filed by the Internal Revenue Service against any Borrower Party, the Collateral, any audits of any Federal or State tax return of any Borrower Party, and the results of any such audit;
will notify Bank promptly after becoming aware of any condemnation or similar proceedings with respect to any of the Collateral, any proceeding seeking to enjoin the intended use of any Project, and of all changes in governmental requirements
pertaining to any Project, utility availability, anticipated costs of completion, and any other matters which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(I)        Borrower will permit Bank and its agents to have access to the
Collateral at reasonable times.

Bank, if Bank so requests, the contracts, bills of sale, receipted vouchers, and agreements, or any of them, to the extent in Borrower's possession or control, under which Borrower claims title to the materials, articles, fixtures and other personal

Borrower will cause, or permit Bank to cause, any Project to be reappraised at Borrower's expense at any time (but not more than once during any twelve-month period except (i) after an Event of Default, or (ii) if required on account of
the requirements of any Governmental Authority or regulatory authority).

(L)        Borrower will certify to Bank, upon request by Bank, that:

(1)        Borrower has materially complied with and
is in compliance with all terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement that are binding upon it;
(2)        To Borrower's knowledge, there exists no Default; or, if such is not the case, that one or more specified Defaults have occurred; and

(3)        The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement are true in all material respects with the same effect as though made on the date of such certificate.
(M)        Borrower will, when requested so to do, make available for inspection and audit by duly authorized representatives of Bank any of its Records, and will
furnish Bank any information regarding its business affairs and financial condition within a reasonable time after written request therefor. Borrower shall reimburse Bank for all costs associated with such audit if the audit reveals a material
discrepancy in any financial report, statement or other document provided to Bank pursuant to this Agreement.

sound business practices.

Days of Bank's request therefor, Borrower will furnish or cause to be furnished to Bank copies of income tax returns filed by any Borrower Party.

terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if any; and

(F)       No Borrower will permit any material changes to the form of tenant lease to be used in connection with the leasing of the Project owned by such Borrower,
unless there is first obtained the prior written approval of Bank.
(G)      No
Borrower will, without Bank's prior written consent, issue, redeem, purchase or retire any of its Equity Interests or grant or issue any warrant, right or option pertaining thereto or any other security convertible into any of the foregoing, nor
otherwise permit any voluntary transfer, sale, redemption, retirement, or other change in the ownership of any Equity Interests of Borrower by the owners of such Equity Interests if the same would result in a Change in Control.

(H)      No Borrower will furnish Bank any certificate or other document that will contain
any untrue statement of material fact or that will omit to state a material fact necessary to make it not misleading in light of the circumstances under which it was furnished.

(I)        No Borrower will, directly or indirectly, apply any part of the

filed with regard to the Permitted Liens) to be on file in any public office with respect to any of the Collateral.
7.3        Insurance and Condemnation Covenants.

(A)        Borrower will obtain and maintain, or cause to be obtained and
maintained, at all times while Borrower is indebted to Bank, at Borrower's sole expense: (a) the Title Insurance Policy; (b) insurance as more particularly described on the attached Schedule 7.3; and (c) such other
insurance on the Projects as may from time to time be required by Bank (including, but not limited to, boiler and machinery insurance, earthquake insurance, and terrorism insurance) against insurable hazards or casualties which at the time are
commonly insured against in the case of premises similarly situated, due regard being given to the height, type, construction, location, use and occupancy of buildings and improvements. If any insurer which has issued a policy of title, hazard,
liability or other insurance required pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan


45










Document becomes insolvent or the subject of any Bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding or if the financial strength rating falls below "A- VII", Borrower shall, in each instance promptly
upon the request of Bank and at Borrower's expense, obtain and deliver to Bank a like policy (or, if and to the extent permitted by Bank, a certificate of insurance) issued by another insurer, which insurer and policy meet the requirements of this
Agreement or such other Loan Documents, as the case may be. A satisfactory certificate of insurance of each initial insurance policy shall be delivered to Bank at the time of execution of this Agreement, with premiums fully paid. Upon renewal or
substitution of such insurance policies, certificates evidencing such renewal or substitution shall be delivered to Bank as promptly as possible, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the expiration date of the policy it
renews or replaces (and in any case, upon request of Bank, Borrower shall deliver copies of such policies). Borrower shall pay all premiums on policies required hereunder as they become due and payable and promptly deliver to Bank evidence
satisfactory to Bank of the timely payment thereof. In the event Borrower fails to provide, maintain, keep in force or deliver and furnish to Bank the insurance required by this Section and after three (3) Business Days written notice from Bank
to comply, Bank may procure such insurance or single-interest insurance for such risks covering Bank's interest, and Borrower will pay all premiums thereon promptly upon demand by Bank. Until such payment is made by Borrower, the amount of all such
premiums shall be added to and become part of the Obligations. If any loss occurs at any time when Borrower has failed to perform Borrower's covenants and agreements in this Section, Bank shall nevertheless be entitled to the benefit of all
insurance covering the loss and held by or for Borrower, to the same extent as if it had been made payable to Bank. Upon any foreclosure of any Mortgage or transfer of title to any Project in extinguishment of the whole or any part of the Loans or
any other amounts owing by Borrower to Bank, all of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at foreclosure or other such transferee, to the extent permissible under such
policies. After the occurrence of an Event of Default or in case of any loss in excess of $500,000.00, Bank shall have the right (but not the obligation) to make proof of loss for, settle and adjust any claim under, and receive the proceeds of, all
insurance for loss of or damage to the Projects, and the expenses incurred by Bank in the adjustment and collection of insurance proceeds shall be added to and become part of the Obligations and shall be due and payable to Bank on demand. Bank shall
not be, under any circumstances (other than Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct), liable or responsible for failure to collect or exercise diligence in the collection of any of such proceeds or for the obtaining, maintaining or adequacy of
any insurance or for failure to see to the proper application of any amount paid over to Borrower. Any such proceeds received by Bank shall be applied and disbursed as provided in this Agreement. Borrower appoints Bank as Borrower's attorney in fact
to cause the issuance of or an endorsement of any policy and to otherwise bring Borrower into compliance with the provisions of this Section and to make any claim for, receive payment for, and execute and endorse any documents, checks or other
instruments in payment for loss, theft, or damage under any such insurance policy.

(B)        Subject to the provisions of the immediately succeeding paragraph,
after deducting from any casualty insurance proceeds all of its expenses incurred in the collection and administration of such sums, including Attorneys' Fees, Bank shall apply


46










the same at its option (i) to the payment of the Obligations, whether or not due and in whatever order Bank elects (in which case a portion of or the entire Obligations shall, at Bank's
option, immediately become due and payable), (ii) to the repair and/or restoration of the Improvements, or (iii) for any other purposes or objects for which Bank is entitled to advance funds under any Loan Document, all without affecting
Bank's Lien, and any balance of such monies then remaining shall be paid to Borrower or the Person lawfully entitled thereto.
(C)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no Event of Default has occurred (and if there shall then be no event which with the passage of time and/or giving of
notice would constitute an Event of Default), then Borrower shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise any claim for Damage if the total amount of such claim is less than $500,000.00, provided that Borrower promptly uses the full amount of
such insurance proceeds for Restoration of the Damage and provides evidence thereof to Bank in a manner acceptable to Bank. If Borrower receives any insurance proceeds for the Damage, then Borrower shall promptly deliver the proceeds to Bank.

(D)        Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately
preceding paragraph to the contrary, and a claim is greater than $500,000.00, Bank agrees that the proceeds of any casualty insurance or any part thereof (after deducting therefrom all of its expenses incurred in the collection and administration of
such sums, including Attorneys' Fees) payable on account of loss or damage to the Improvements will be made available by Bank to be applied by Borrower to restoration or repair of the Improvements provided the following conditions are met:

(1)        There exists no Default;

(2)        Borrower presents sufficient evidence satisfactory to
Bank that (A) the Improvements are capable of being, and will be, restored in compliance with all applicable Laws to an architectural whole and to substantially the same condition and value as prior to the casualty, (B) restoration of the
Improvements to an architectural whole will be completed on or before the Maturity Date, (C) there are sufficient funds from such insurance proceeds and other available monies, to completely restore or repair the Improvements to an
architectural whole, as well as to maintain relevant debt service coverages and other operating expenses, and (D) Bank will not incur any liability to any other Person as a result of such use or release of insurance proceeds;

(3)        The plans and specifications for restoration or
repair are approved in writing by Bank, in its sole discretion (and Bank agrees to respond promptly with respect to any proposed plans and specifications);

(4)        All parties having existing or expected possessory
interests in the Improvements agree to continue, in a manner satisfactory to Bank, to fulfill the contract terms then in effect following the restoration or repair (including, without limitation, the payment of rent or other sums without abatement
or reduction except as approved by Bank, in its sole discretion), or Borrower shall


47










deliver security satisfactory to Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, to substitute for the loss of income caused by the failure of any such possessory interest to agree to continue to
fulfill the contract terms then in effect following restoration or repair;

(5)        All parties having operating, management or franchise
interests in, and arrangements concerning, the Improvements, if any, agree that they will continue their interests and arrangements for the contract terms then in effect following the restoration or repair;

(6)        All parties having commitments to provide financing
with respect to the Improvements, to purchase Borrower's interest in full or in part in the Improvements, or to purchase the applicable Loan, agree in a manner satisfactory to Bank that their commitments will continue in full force and effect and,
if necessary, the expiration of such commitments will be extended by the time necessary to complete the restoration or repair; and
(7)        Borrower shall enter into such agreements and deliver such other documents and other things as may be required by Bank in connection with the
disbursement of all such proceeds.
If the foregoing conditions are satisfied within ninety (90) days
after the date of loss, then the insurance proceeds shall be held by Bank and, after deducting from said insurance proceeds all of its expenses incurred in the collection and administration of such sums, including Attorneys' Fees, Bank shall
disburse the net insurance proceeds to or on behalf of Borrower as repair or restoration progresses and to the extent such proceeds are required to defray the expenses of such restoration or repair; and to the extent any such proceeds are not
required to defray the expenses of such restoration or repair, Bank may, at its option, apply any such unused proceeds as provided for in the immediately preceding paragraph (B) of this Section. At all times during such restoration or repair,
Borrower shall deposit with Bank funds which, when added to insurance proceeds on deposit with Bank, are sufficient to complete the restoration or repair of the Improvements to an architectural whole, as determined by Bank, in Bank's discretion, in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications and all applicable Laws.
If the conditions set forth in
clauses (1) through (7) of this Section are not satisfied within ninety (90) days of the date of loss, then the insurance proceeds shall be disbursed as provided for in the immediately preceding paragraph (B) of this Section.

(E)        If all or any material portion of any Project shall be
damaged or taken through condemnation (which term shall include any damage or taking by any Governmental Authority and any transfer by private sale in lieu thereof), either temporarily or permanently, other than a taking for the purpose of widening
existing roads bordering the Land or for utility easements or any other similar purpose which does not adversely affect access or the use of such Project for its intended purposes, then a portion of or the entire Obligations shall, at the option of
Bank, immediately become due and payable. Borrower, immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the institution, or the

proposed, contemplated or threatened institution of any action or proceeding for the taking through condemnation of any Project or any part thereof will notify Bank, and Bank is hereby
authorized, at its option, to commence, appear in and prosecute, through counsel selected by Bank, any action or proceeding relating to any condemnation. Borrower may compromise or settle any claim for compensation; but shall not make any compromise
or settlement for an award unless all of the Obligations are paid and satisfied in full, without the prior written consent of Bank; such compensation, awards, damages, claims, rights of action and proceeds and the right thereto are hereby assigned
by Borrower to Bank, and Bank is authorized, at its option, to collect and receive all such compensation, awards or damages and to give proper receipts and acquittances therefor without any obligation to question the amount of any such compensation,
awards or damages; and after deducting from said condemnation proceeds all of its expenses incurred in the collection and administration of such sums, including Attorneys' Fees, the net proceeds shall be dealt with by Bank in accordance with, and
subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in Paragraph (B) or Paragraph (C), as applicable, of Section 7.3 hereof as if the condemnation proceeds were insurance proceeds and as if the date the condemnation proceeds become
payable to Borrower was the date of loss.

7.4        Assigned Document Covenants.

Except as may otherwise be expressly provided for in this Agreement, including the immediately following
paragraph, Borrower shall (a) observe and perform all the obligations imposed upon Borrower under each Assigned Document; (b) not do, or permit to be done, anything to impair the security of any Assigned Document; (c) promptly send to
Bank copies of each notice of default which Borrower shall send or receive under the Assigned Documents; (d) enforce the performance and observance of the provisions of each Assigned Document; (e) not collect any of the Rents except as set
forth in this Agreement; (f) not subordinate any Assigned Document to any Lien, or permit, consent, or agree to any such subordination without the prior written consent of Bank; (g) not alter, modify or change, in any material respect, the
terms of any Assigned Document, nor give any consent to exercise any option required or permitted by such terms (to the extent such consent is required) without the prior written consent of Bank in each such case; (h) not cancel or terminate
any Assigned Document, or accept a surrender of any Assigned Document; (i) not convey or transfer, and shall not suffer or permit a conveyance or transfer of, the Mortgaged Property, or of any interest in the Mortgaged Property, so as to affect
directly or indirectly, approximately or remotely, a merger of the estates and rights of, or a termination or diminution of the obligations of any other party to and under any Assigned Lease; (j) not alter, modify or change, in any material
respect, the terms of any guaranty of any Assigned Document, and shall not cancel or terminate any such guaranty, without the prior written consent of Bank in each such case; (k) not consent to any assignment of, or subletting under, any
Assigned Lease (to the extent such consent is required) without the prior written consent of Bank; (l) at Bank's request, execute any documentation confirming the assignment and transfer to Bank of each Assigned Document; and (m) execute
and deliver, at the request of Bank, all other further assurances, confirmations and assignments in the Assigned Documents as Bank shall, from time to time, reasonably require in order to evidence or secure the rights of Bank hereunder.


49









Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, so
long as there shall not exist any Event of Default, then Borrower shall have the right to continue to exercise all its rights and perform its obligations under the Assigned Documents, including the right to collect each payment of Rents at the time
of the date provided in the applicable Assigned Lease for such payment.

7.5        Escrow
Deposits.    At the option of Bank and further to secure the payment of taxes, assessments, other charges, and insurance premiums applicable or attributable to the Mortgaged Property, Borrower shall upon request of Bank
following a Default deposit with Bank, on the first day of each month, such amounts as, in the reasonable estimation of Bank, shall be necessary to pay such taxes, assessments, charges and premiums as they become due; said deposits to be held and to
be used by Bank to pay such taxes, assessments, charges and premiums as the same accrue and are payable. Payment from said sums for said purposes shall be made by Bank at its discretion and may be made even though such payments will benefit
subsequent owners of the Mortgaged Property. Said deposits shall not be, nor be deemed to be, trust funds, but may be, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, commingled with the general funds of Bank, and no interest shall be payable in respect
thereof. If said deposits are insufficient to pay the taxes and assessments, insurance premiums and other charges in full as the same become payable, Borrower will deposit with Bank such additional sum or sums as may be required in order for Bank to
pay such taxes and assessments, insurance premiums and other charges in full. Upon any Event of Default, Bank may, at its option, apply any money in the fund relating from said deposits to the payment of the Obligations in such manner as it may
elect.
7.6        Filing Fees and
Taxes.    Borrower covenants and agrees to pay all recording and filing fees, revenue stamps, taxes and other expenses and charges payable in connection with the execution and delivery to Bank of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, and the recording, filing, satisfaction, continuation and release of any financing statements or other instruments filed or recorded in connection herewith or therewith.

7.7        Further
Assurances.    Borrower covenants and agrees that, at Borrower's cost and expense, upon request of Bank, Borrower shall duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly executed and delivered, to Bank such further instruments
and do and cause to be done such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper in the opinion of Bank or its counsel to carry out more effectively the provisions and purposes of this Agreement.

8.6        Right of
Set-Off.    Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Bank may, and is hereby authorized by Borrower, at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, and Without Notice to Borrower,
set-off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and any other indebtedness at any time owing by Bank to, or for the credit or the account of, Borrower against any or all of the

creditor of Borrower, or such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been
exercised by Bank prior to the making, filing or issuance, or service upon Bank of, or of notice of, any such petition; assignment for the benefit of creditors; appointment or application for the appointment of a receiver; or issuance of execution,
subpoena, order or warrant. Bank agrees to promptly notify Borrower after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of Bank under this

8.7        No Limitation on Rights and Remedies.    The enumeration of the powers, rights and remedies
in this Article shall not be construed to limit the exercise thereof to such time as an Event of Default occurs if, under applicable Law or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, Bank has any of such powers, rights and
remedies regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred, and any limitation contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents as to Bank's exercise of any power, right or remedy for a period of time only during the continuance of an
Event of Default shall only be applicable at such time as Bank shall have actual knowledge that such Event of Default is no longer continuing and for a reasonable time thereafter as may be necessary for Bank to cease the exercise of such powers,
rights and remedies (it being expressly understood and agreed that until such time as Bank shall obtain such knowledge and after the expiration of such reasonable time, Bank shall have no liability whatsoever for the commencement of or continuing
exercise of any such power, right or remedy).

Bank under this Agreement, after deducting all charges, expenses, costs and Attorneys' Fees relating thereto, shall be applied by Bank to the payment of the Obligations, whether due or to become due, in such order and in such proportions as Bank may
elect; and Borrower shall remain liable to Bank for any deficiency.

ARTICLE IX



9.
MISCELLANEOUS.


9.1        Termination of Bank's Lien.    This Agreement and Bank’s Lien will not be terminated
until one of Bank's officers signs a written termination or satisfaction agreement to such effect. Even if Borrower should pay all of the Obligations owing to Bank at any one time, Bank's Lien will continue to secure any sum Borrower should later
owe Bank until the written termination or satisfaction agreement referred to above has been executed by Bank (provided that Bank agrees to promptly provide a written termination or satisfaction agreement upon request of Borrower, provided that the
Obligations have been paid in full, Bank has no obligation to make any further Advances or new Project Loans or otherwise extend any credit to Borrower under the Loan Documents, and there is not existing any Default). Except as otherwise expressly
provided for in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement shall in any way affect or impair the representations, warranties, agreements, covenants, obligations, duties and Obligations of Borrower or the powers, rights, and remedies of Bank
under this Agreement with respect to any transaction or event occurring prior to such termination, all of which shall survive such termination. In no event shall Bank be obligated to terminate Bank’s Lien or return or release the Collateral or
any portion thereof to Borrower (a) until payment in full of the Obligations, or (b) if Bank is obligated to extend credit to Borrower.
9.2        Construction.    The provisions of this Agreement shall be in addition to those of any other
Loan Document and any guaranty, pledge or security agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, security deed, note or other evidence of liability given by any Borrower Party to or for the benefit of any Bank Party with respect to the Loans, all of which
shall be construed as complementary to each other, and all existing liabilities and obligations of any Borrower Party to any Bank Party with respect to the Loans and any Liens heretofore granted to or for the benefit of any Bank Party with respect
to the Loans shall, except and only to the extent expressly provided herein to the contrary, remain in full force and effect, and shall not be released, impaired, diminished, or in any other way modified or amended as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or by the agreements and undertaking of any Borrower Party contained herein and therein. Nothing herein contained shall prevent any Bank Party from enforcing any or all other notes, guaranties,
pledges or security agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust, or security deeds in accordance with their respective terms. In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall control. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
9.3        Indemnity.    Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Bank Parties and their respective officers,
directors, agents, and attorneys against, and to hold Bank Parties and all such other Persons harmless from all Default Costs, which indemnification is in addition to, and not in derogation of, any statutory, equitable, or common law right or remedy
Bank Parties may have for breach of representation, warranty, statement or covenant or otherwise may have under any of the Loan Documents. This agreement of indemnity shall be a continuing agreement and shall survive payment of the Loan and
termination of this Agreement.


56










9.4        Bank's Consent or Approval.

(A)        Except where otherwise expressly provided in the Loan
Documents, in any instance where any matter or thing is required to be "satisfactory" to Bank or to Bank's "satisfaction", or in Bank's "discretion" and/or where the approval, consent, or the exercise of Bank's judgment or discretion is otherwise
required or permitted, the granting or denial of such approval or consent and the exercise of such judgment or discretion shall be (a) within the sole and absolute discretion of Bank; and (b) deemed to have been given only by a specific
writing intended for the purpose given and executed by Bank.

(B)        Notwithstanding any approvals or consents by Bank, Bank has no
obligation or responsibility whatsoever for the adequacy, form or content of any contract, any lease, or any other matter incident to any Project. Any inspection or audit of any Project or the Records of Borrower, or the procuring of documents and
financial and other information, by or on behalf of Bank shall be for Bank's protection only, and shall not constitute any assumption of responsibility to Borrower or anyone else with regard to the condition, maintenance or operation of any Project,
or relieve Borrower of any of Borrower's obligations. Bank has no duty to supervise or to inspect any Project nor any duty of care to Borrower or any other Person to protect against, or inform Borrower or any other Person of, the existence of
negligent, faulty, inadequate or defective design or construction of any Project.

9.5        Enforcement and Waiver by Bank.    Bank shall have the right at all times to enforce the provisions of this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents in strict
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, notwithstanding any conduct or custom on the part of Bank in refraining from so doing at any time or times. The failure of Bank at any time or times to enforce its rights under such provisions, strictly
in accordance with the same, shall not be construed as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to specific provisions of this Agreement or as having in any way or manner modified or waived the same. All rights and remedies of Bank are
cumulative and concurrent and the exercise of one right or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any other right or remedy.
9.6        Expenses of Bank.    Borrower will, on demand, reimburse Bank for all expenses incurred by
Bank in connection with the preparation, administration, amendment, modification or enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and/or in the collection of any amounts owing from Borrower or any other Person to Bank under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and, until so paid, the amount of such expenses shall be added to and become part of the Obligations.
9.7        Attorneys' Fees.    If at any time or times hereafter Bank employs counsel to advise or
provide other representation with respect to this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other agreement, document or instrument heretofore, now or hereafter


57










executed by any Borrower Party and delivered to Bank with respect to the Obligations, or to commence, defend or intervene, file a petition, complaint, answer, motion or other pleadings or to take
any other action in or with respect to any suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other agreement, instrument or document heretofore, now or hereafter executed by any Borrower Party and delivered to Bank with
respect to the Obligations, or to represent Bank in any litigation with respect to the affairs of any Borrower Party, or to enforce any rights of Bank or obligations of any Borrower Party or any other Person which may be obligated to Bank by virtue
of this Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other agreement, document or instrument heretofore, now or hereafter delivered to Bank by or for the benefit of Borrower with respect to the Obligations, or to collect from Borrower any amounts owing
hereunder, then in any such event, all of the Attorneys' Fees incurred by Bank arising from such services and any expenses, costs and charges relating thereto shall constitute additional obligations of Borrower payable on demand and, until so paid,
shall be added to and become part of the Obligations.

9.8        Exclusiveness.
This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are made for the sole protection of Borrower Parties and Bank, and Bank's successors and assigns, and no other Person shall have any right of action hereunder.

9.9        Notices.

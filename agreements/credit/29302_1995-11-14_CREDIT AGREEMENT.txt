Commitment, as the same may be reduced under Section 2.05 or Section 2.07 or

Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Company has failed to select timely a new Interest
Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans, or if any Default or
Event of Default then exists, the applicable Borrowers shall be deemed to have
elected to convert such Eurodollar Rate Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as
of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

(d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Bank of its
receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, or, if no timely notice is
provided by the applicable Borrowers, the Administrative Agent will promptly
notify each Bank of the details of any automatic conversion.  All conversions
and continuations shall be made ratably according to the respective outstanding
principal amounts of the Loans with respect to which the notice was given held
by each Bank.

(e) Unless the Majority Banks otherwise agree, during the existence of
a Default or Event of Default, the applicable Borrowers may not elect to have a
Loan converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Rate Loan.

(f) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of Loans,
there may not be more than eight (8) different Interest Periods in effect.

2.05 Voluntary Termination or Reduction of Commitments.  The Company may,
upon not less than five (5) Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative
Agent, terminate the Commitments, or permanently reduce the Commitments by an
aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof; unless, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of Loans
made on the effective date thereof, the Effective Amount of all Revolving Loans
and Term Loans together would exceed the amount of the combined Commitments then
in effect.  Once reduced in accordance with this Section, the Commitments may
not be increased.  Any reduction of the Commitments shall be applied to each
Bank according to its Pro Rata Share.  All accrued Commitment Fees to, but not
including, the effective date of any reduction or termination of Commitments,
shall be paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination.  In the
event of any optional prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 of this
Agreement, or any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.07 of
this Agreement, the Term Loan Commitment (and, correspondingly, the total
Commitments) automatically shall reduce by the amount of such prepayment.

2.06 Optional Prepayments.  Subject to Section 3.04, the Borrowers may, at
any time or from time to time, upon not less than three (3) Business Days'
irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay Base Rate Loans and/or
Eurodollar Rate Loans in whole or in part, in each such case in minimum amounts
of $5,000,000 or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.  Such notice of
prepayment shall specify the date and amount of each such prepayment, the
Interest Rate Type(s) of the Loans to be prepaid, the identity of the applicable
Borrower or Borrowers and whether such Loans are Revolving Loans or Term Loans.
The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Bank of its receipt of any

20
<PAGE>

such notice, and of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment.  If such
notice is given by the applicable Borrower(s), the applicable Borrower(s) shall
make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be
due and payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to
each such date on the amount prepaid and any amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.04.  Optional prepayments of the Term Loans shall be applied to the
then remaining installments payable in respect of the Term Loans on a pro rata
basis (based upon the scheduled principal amount of each such installment after
giving effect to all prior reductions thereto).

2.07 Mandatory Prepayments; Mandatory Commitment Reductions.

(a)  If the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries issues
capital stock or other equity interests for cash proceeds after the Closing Date
(other than capital stock issued pursuant to the Company's employee or director
stock based plans), 100% of the Net Proceeds of such issuance shall be applied
in prepayment of the outstanding Loans, such amount to be applied 50% to the
outstanding Term Loans and 50% to the outstanding Revolving Loans.  Such
prepayment shall be made on or before that date which is ten (10) days after the
date of such issuance.

(b) In addition to the foregoing, if the Company for any reason does
not consummate the EI Acquisition on or before the Term Loan Commitment
Termination Date, (i) the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Banks hereunder
automatically shall reduce by the amount of $65,000,000 (such that, for example,
absent any other reduction therein, the amount thereof would reduce
automatically to $135,000,000), (ii) the Term Loan Commitment of the Banks
hereunder automatically shall reduce by the amount of $65,000,000, (iii) the
Revolving Loan Borrowers shall prepay the Revolving Loans by an amount
sufficient to reduce the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness and
liabilities of the Revolving Loan Borrowers under the Revolving Notes to an
amount that is less than or equal to the then Revolving Credit Commitment (after
giving effect to the reduction thereof pursuant to this subsection 2.07(b)), and
(iv) the Term Loan Borrower shall prepay the Term Loans by an amount sufficient
to reduce the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness and liabilities of the
Term Loan Borrower under the Term Notes to an amount that is less than or equal
to the then Term Loan Commitment (after giving effect to the reduction thereof
pursuant to this subsection 2.07(b)).

(c)  Any prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.07
shall be applied pro rata to the then remaining installments payable in respect
of the Term Loans, and shall be applied, unless otherwise directed by the Term
Loan Borrower to the Administrative Agent in writing, first to any Base Rate
Loans then outstanding and then, to the extent available, to the Eurodollar
Loans then outstanding with the shortest Interest Periods remaining, and, in the
event of any such prepayment of the Term Loans, the Term Loan Commitment (and,
correspondingly, the total Commitments) automatically shall reduce by the amount
of such prepayment.

(d)  Any prepayment of the Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section
2.07 shall be applied first to any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then, to
the extent available, to any Eurodollar Rate Loans then outstanding with the
shortest Interest Periods remaining; provided, however, that, except as provided
in subsection (b) of this Section 2.07,

21
<PAGE>

such prepayment shall not have the effect of reducing the Revolving Credit
Commitment of the Banks hereunder.

(e)  The Borrowers shall pay, together with each prepayment under this
Section 2.07, accrued interest on the amount prepaid and any amounts required
pursuant to Section 3.04.

2.08 Repayment.

(a) The Term Credit.  The Term Loan Borrower shall repay the Term
Loans in twenty-three (23) installments, all of such installments, except for
the last, being in the amount, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar,
equal to one twenty-third (1/23) of the aggregate principal balance of the Term
Loans outstanding on January 1, 1996, and the last and final installment being
in the amount of the then remaining unpaid principal balance thereof, the first
such installment of principal being due and payable on March 31, 1996, and a
subsequent installment of principal being due and payable on the last day of
each succeeding calendar quarter thereafter until the Term Loan Maturity Date,
when the then remaining unpaid balance of principal of the Term Loans, and all
accrued unpaid interest in respect thereof, shall be due and payable in full.

(b) The Revolving Credit.  The Revolving Loan Borrowers shall repay to
the Banks on the Revolving Credit Termination Date the aggregate principal
amount of Revolving Loans outstanding on such date.

(c)      Interest.

(i) Each Revolving Loan and each Term Loan shall bear interest on
the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date
at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate, as the
case may be (and subject to the Borrowers' right to convert to other
Interest Rate Types of Loans under Section 2.04), plus the Applicable
Margin.

(ii) Interest on each Revolving Loan and Term Loan shall be paid
in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.  Interest shall also be paid on
the date of any prepayment of Loans under Section 2.06 or 2.07 for the
portion of the Loans so prepaid and upon payment (including prepayment) in
full thereof and, during the existence of any Event of Default, interest
shall be paid on demand of the Administrative Agent at the request or with
the consent of the Majority Banks.

(iii)  Notwithstanding subsection (i) of this subsection 2.08(c),
while any Event of Default exists or after acceleration, the Borrowers
shall pay interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to
the extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of all outstanding
Obligations, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus two percent
(2%).

22
<PAGE>

(d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations
of the Borrowers to any Bank hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that
payments of interest shall not be required for any period for which interest is
computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for,
collecting, charging, taking, reserving or receiving such payment by such Bank
would be contrary to the provisions of any law applicable to such Bank limiting
the highest rate of interest that may be lawfully contracted for, collected,
charged, taken, reserved or received by such Bank, and in such event the
Borrowers shall pay such Bank interest as provided in Section 10.16.

2.09 Fees.

(a) Arrangement, Agency and Participation Fees.  The Company shall (i)
pay an arrangement fee to the Arrangers for the Arrangers' own accounts, as
required by the fee letter (the "Fee Letter") among the Agents, the Arrangers
and Weatherford, dated August 28, 1995, (ii) pay an agency fee to the
Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's own account, as required by
the letter agreement (the "Administrative Agent's Letter") between Weatherford
and the Administrative Agent dated August 28, 1995, and (iii) pay participation
fees to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each of the Banks, as
provided in the invitation letters (the "Invitation Letters") from Weatherford
to the respective Banks.

(b) Commitment Fees.  The Company also shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Bank a fee (the "Commitment Fee") on the average
daily unused portion of such Bank's Commitment, computed on a quarterly basis in
arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter based upon the daily
utilization for that quarter as calculated by the Administrative Agent, equal to
the applicable percent per annum denominated "Commitment Fee," determined from
time to time with reference to the relevant Capitalization Ratio, as set forth
on Schedule 2.02 attached hereto.  For purposes of calculating utilization under
this subsection, the Commitments shall be deemed used to the extent of the
Effective Amount of Revolving Loans and Term Loans then outstanding.  Such
commitment fee shall accrue from the Closing Date to the Revolving Credit
Termination Date and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last
Business Day of each calendar quarter commencing on December 31, 1995, with the
final payment to be made on the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided
that, in connection with any reduction or termination of Commitments under
Section 2.05 or Section 2.07, the accrued Commitment Fee calculated for the
period ending on such date shall also be paid on the date of such reduction or
termination, with the following quarterly payment being calculated on the basis
of the period from such reduction or termination date to such quarterly payment
date.  The Commitment Fee provided in this subsection shall accrue at all times
from and after the date of this Agreement.

23
<PAGE>

2.10 Computation of Fees and Interest.

(a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans shall be made on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days
elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis
of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being
paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest and fees shall
accrue during each period during which interest or such fees are computed from
the first day thereof to the last day thereof.

(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent
shall be conclusive and binding on the Company, the Borrowers and the Banks in
the absence of manifest error.  The Administrative Agent will, at the request of
the Company, the Borrowers or any Bank, deliver to the Company, the Borrowers or
the Bank, as the case may be, a statement showing the quotations used by the
Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate and the resulting interest
rate.

2.11 Payments by the Company and/or the Borrowers.

(a) All payments to be made by the Company and/or the Borrowers shall
be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim.  Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, all payments by the Company and/or the Borrowers
shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks at the
Administrative Agent's Payment Office, and shall be made in dollars and in
immediately available funds, no later than 10:00 a.m. (Houston, Texas time) on
the date specified herein.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Bank its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided
herein) of such payment in like funds as received.  Any payment received by the
Administrative Agent later than 10:00 a.m. (Houston, Texas time) shall be deemed
to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest
or fee shall continue to accrue.

(b) Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest
Period" herein, whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as
the case may be.

(c) Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from the Company
and/or the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks
that the Company and/or the Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and
when required, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company and/or the
Borrowers have made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such
date in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall
not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Bank
on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to
the extent the Company and/or the Borrowers have not made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent
on demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with interest thereon
at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed
to such Bank until the date repaid.

24
<PAGE>

2.12 Payments by the Banks to the Administrative Agent.

(a) Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from a Bank on or
prior to the Closing Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the Closing
Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such
Bank will not make available as and when required hereunder to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrowers the amount of that Bank's
Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that each
Bank has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately
available funds on the Borrowing Date and the Administrative Agent may (but
shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the Borrowers on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent any
Bank shall not have made its full amount available to the Administrative Agent
in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent in such
circumstances has made available to the Borrowers such amount, that Bank shall
on the Business Day following such Borrowing Date make such amount available to
the Administrative Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for
each day during such period.  A notice of the Administrative Agent submitted to
any Bank with respect to amounts owing under this subsection (a) shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error.  If such amount is so made available, such
payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Bank's Loan on the
date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement.  If such amount is not
made available to the Administrative Agent on the Business Day following the
Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent will notify the Borrowers of such
failure to fund and, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers
shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's
account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of
such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the
time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

(b) The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any Borrowing Date
shall not relieve any other Bank of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on
such Borrowing Date, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on any Borrowing Date.

2.13 Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share, such Bank shall
immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase
from the other Banks such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment pro rata
with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to
that extent be rescinded and each other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank
the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
paying Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered.  The Company and
the Borrowers agree that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another
Bank may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of
payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 10.09) with
respect to such participation as fully as if

25
<PAGE>

such Bank were the direct creditor of the Company and/or the Borrowers in the
amount of such participation.  The Administrative Agent will keep records (which
shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of
participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Banks following any such purchases or repayments.


ARTICLE III

TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

3.01 Taxes.

(a) Any and all payments by the Company and/or the Borrowers to the
Banks or the Agents under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes.  In
addition, the Company and/or the Borrowers shall pay all Other Taxes.

(b) The Company and each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Bank and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes or
Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Bank or the Administrative Agent
and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other
Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.  Payment under this indemnification
shall be made within 30 days after the date the Bank or the Administrative Agent
makes written demand therefor, accompanied by the certificate described in
Section 3.07 of this Agreement.

(c) If the Company and/or the Borrowers shall be required by law to
deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder to any Bank or the Administrative Agent, then:

(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such
Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or
withholdings been made;

(ii) the Company and/or the Borrowers, as applicable, shall make
such deductions and withholdings;

(iii)  the Company and/or the Borrowers, as applicable, shall pay
the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or
other authority in accordance with applicable law; and

(iv) the Company and/or the Borrowers, as applicable, shall also
pay to each Bank or the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank,
at the time interest is paid, all additional amounts which the respective

26
<PAGE>

Bank specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield the Bank would
have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.

(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Company and,
or, the Borrowers, as applicable, of Taxes or Other Taxes, the Company and/or
the Borrowers, as applicable, shall furnish the Administrative Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other
evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(e) If the Company and/or the Borrowers, as applicable, is required to
pay additional amounts to any Bank or the Administrative Agent pursuant to
subsection (c) of this Section, then such Bank shall use reasonable efforts
(consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction
of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the
Company and/or the Borrowers, as applicable, which may thereafter accrue, if
such change in the judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to
such Bank.

3.02 Illegality.

(a) If any Bank determines that the introduction of any Requirement of
Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the interpretation or
administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it unlawful, or that any
central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Bank or its applicable Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans,
then, on notice thereof by the Bank to the Company through the Administrative
Agent, any obligation of that Bank to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Bank notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that
the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

(b) If a Bank determines that it is unlawful to maintain any
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the applicable Borrower(s) shall, upon receipt of notice
of such fact and demand from such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), prepay in full such Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Bank then outstanding,
together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under Section 3.04,
either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if the Bank may lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if
the Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan.  If a
Borrower is required to so prepay any Eurodollar Rate Loan, then concurrently
with such prepayment (unless the Borrower simultaneously prepays the
corresponding Eurodollar Rate Loans of every other Bank), such Borrower shall
borrow from the affected Bank, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate
Loan.

(c) If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans has been so terminated or suspended, all Loans which would otherwise be
made by the Bank as Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be instead Base Rate Loans.

(d) Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent under this
Section, the affected Bank shall designate a different Lending Office with
respect to its Eurodollar Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for
giving such notice or making such

27
<PAGE>

demand and will not, in the judgment of the Bank, be illegal or otherwise
disadvantageous to the Bank.

3.03 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return.

(a) If any Bank determines that, due to either (i) the introduction of
or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the
compliance by that Bank with any guideline or request from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there
shall be any increase in the cost to such Bank of agreeing to make or making,
funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans, then the Company and the
Borrowers shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon written demand,
accompanied by the certificate described in Section 3.07 of this Agreement (with
a copy of such demand and certificate to be sent to the Administrative Agent),
pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, additional amounts
as are sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased costs.

(b) If any Bank shall have determined that (i) the introduction of any
Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation,
(iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy
Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by the Bank (or its
Lending Office) or any corporation controlling the Bank with any Capital
Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by the Bank or any corporation controlling the Bank
and (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with
respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's desired return on capital)
determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its
Commitments, loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon
written demand of such Bank to the Company, accompanied by the certificate
described in Section 3.07 of this Agreement (with a copy of such demand and
certificate to be sent to the Administrative Agent), the Company and/or the
Borrowers, as applicable, shall pay to the Bank, from time to time as specified
by the Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank for such
increase.

3.04 Funding Losses.  The Company and the Borrowers shall reimburse each
Bank and hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which the Bank may
sustain or incur as a consequence of:

(a) the failure of the Borrowers to make on a timely basis any payment
of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan;

(b) the failure of the Borrowers to borrow, continue or convert a Loan
after the Company has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing
or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation;

(c) the failure of the Borrowers to make any prepayment in accordance
with any notice delivered under Section 2.06;

28
<PAGE>

(d) the prepayment (including pursuant to Section 2.06 or Section
2.07) or other payment (including after acceleration thereof) of a Eurodollar
Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; or

(e) the automatic conversion under Section 2.04 of any Eurodollar Rate
Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant
Interest Period;

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans or from fees
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.  For
purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company and/or the Borrowers to
the Banks under this Section and under subsection 3.03(a), each Eurodollar Rate
Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the reference
rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan by a
matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank eurodollar market for a
comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar
Rate Loan is in fact so funded.

3.05 Inability to Determine Rates.  If the Administrative Agent determines
that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining
the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate applicable for any requested
Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Banks of funding such Loan, the
Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Bank.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent upon the
instruction of the Majority Banks revokes such notice in writing.  Upon receipt
of such notice, the Company may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it.  If the Company does not revoke
such notice, the Banks shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by
the Company, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the
Company, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans
instead of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

3.06 Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.  The Company and/or the Borrowers
shall pay to each Bank, as long as such Bank shall be required under regulations
of the FRB to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting
of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency
liabilities"), additional costs on the unpaid principal amount of each
Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to
such Loan by the Bank (as determined by the Bank in good faith, which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), payable on each date
on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Company shall have
received at least 15 days' prior written notice (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from the Bank.  If a Bank
fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such
additional interest shall be payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.  Any
such notice shall be accompanied by the certificate described in Section 3.07 of
this Agreement.

29
<PAGE>

3.07 Certificates of Banks.  Any Bank claiming reimbursement or
compensation under this Article III shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount payable to the Bank hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive
and binding on the Company and the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error.
All determinations by a Bank of a right to reimbursement or compensation under
this Article III shall be made in good faith and on a reasonable basis.

3.08 Substitution of Banks.  Upon the receipt by the Company from any Bank
(an "Affected Bank") of a claim for compensation under Section 3.03, the Company
may:  (i) request the Affected Bank to use its best efforts to obtain a
replacement bank or financial institution satisfactory to the Company to acquire
and assume all or a ratable part of all of such Affected Bank's Loans and
Commitment (a "Replacement Bank"); (ii) request one or more of the other Banks
to acquire and assume all or part of such Affected Bank's Loans and Commitment;
or (iii) designate a Replacement Bank.  Any such designation of a Replacement
Bank under clause (i) or (iii) shall be subject to the prior written consent of
the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

3.09 Survival.  The agreements and obligations of the Company in this
Article III shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

3.10 Tax Forms.  Each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof hereby certifies, as of the date
such Bank became a "Bank" hereunder, that, to its knowledge, it is entitled to
receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes.  In the event that any such Bank fails to
deliver any forms required under Section 9.10(a), each of the Company's and the
Borrowers' obligations to pay additional amounts to such Bank under this Article
III shall be reduced to the amount that they would have been obligated to pay
had such forms been provided.


ARTICLE IV

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

4.01 Conditions of Initial Credit Extensions.  The obligation of each Bank
to make its initial Credit Extension hereunder is subject to the condition that
the Administrative Agent shall have received on or before the Closing Date all
of the following, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agents and each
Bank, and in sufficient copies for each Bank:

(a) Loan Documents.  This Agreement, the Notes, the Guaranties and the
other Loan Documents executed by each party thereto;

(b) Certificate (Merger).  A certificate signed by a Responsible

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Company and each of the Borrowers represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent and each Bank that:

5.01 Corporate Existence and Power.  The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries:  (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation; (b) has the
power and authority and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals to own its assets, carry on its business and to execute,
deliver, and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents; (c) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and is licensed and in good standing under
the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of
property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification or license;
and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law; except, in each case
referred to in clause (c) or clause (d), to the extent that the failure to do so
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.02 Corporate Authorization; No Contravention.  The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of this Agreement and each
other Loan Document to which such Person is party, have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action, and do not and will not: (a) contravene the
terms of any of that Person's Organization Documents; (b) conflict with or
result in any breach or contravention of, in any material respect, any document
evidencing any material Contractual Obligation to which such Person is a party
or result in the creation of any Lien under any such document, or (c) conflict
with or result in any breach or contravention of any material order, injunction,
writ or decree of any Governmental Authority to which such Person or its
property is subject; or (d) violate any material Requirement of Law.

5.03 Governmental Authorization.  No approval, consent, exemption,
authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is necessary or required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by, or enforcement against, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of the Agreement or any other Loan Document.

5.04 Binding Effect.  This Agreement and each other Loan Document to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party constitute the legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the extent
it is a party thereto, enforceable against such Person in accordance with their
respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.

5.05 Litigation.  (a)  Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 5.05,
there are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims or disputes pending, or to the
best knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in
arbitration or before any Governmental Authority, against Weatherford, Enterra,
EI, the Company, or any of their

34
<PAGE>

respective Subsidiaries or any of their or their Subsidiaries' respective
properties which: (i) purport to affect or pertain to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
or (ii) if determined adversely to the Company or its Subsidiaries, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No injunction, writ, temporary restraining order or any order of any
nature has been issued by any court or other Governmental Authority purporting
to enjoin or restrain the execution, delivery or performance of the Merger, the
Oil Field Merger, the EI Acquisition, this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
or directing that the transactions provided for herein or therein not be
consummated as herein or therein provided.

5.06 No Default.  No Default or Event of Default exists or would result
from the incurring of any Obligations by the Company, the Borrowers or any of
the Guarantors.  As of the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is in default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation in any respect
which, individually or together with all such defaults, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or that would, if such default had
occurred after the Closing Date, create an Event of Default under subsection
8.01(e).

5.07 ERISA Compliance.  Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 5.07:

(a) Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other federal or state law, except
where the failure to be in compliance would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Company's Foreign Subsidiaries
and any benefit plans maintained by any of them for the benefit of their
directors, officers, employees or former employees (or any of their
beneficiaries) are in compliance with applicable laws pertaining to such plans
in the jurisdictions of such subsidiaries, except where such failure to be in
compliance would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.  Each Pension Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS,
or filed with the IRS a request for (or is still within the applicable remedial
amendment period for filing) a favorable determination letter, and to the best
knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred which would cause the loss of
such qualification.  The Company and each ERISA Affiliate has made all required
contributions to any Pension Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, and no
application for a funding waiver or an extension of any amortization period
pursuant to Section 412 of the Code has been made with respect to any Pension
Plan.  Each Plan that is intended to be a voluntary employee benefit association
has been submitted to and approved by the IRS as exempt from federal income tax
under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code or the applicable submission period relating
to any such Plan will not have ended prior to the Closing Date.

(b) There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of Company,
threatened claims, actions or lawsuits (other than routine claims for benefits),
or action by any Governmental Authority, with respect to any Plan which has
resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
There has been no prohibited transaction (unless the Plan received or is
entitled to an exemption under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code,
as applicable, or unless such transaction has been corrected and all applicable
excise taxes paid or waived), or violation of the fiduciary

35
<PAGE>

responsibility rules with respect to any Plan which has resulted or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) (i) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur; (ii) as of the Closing Date, no Pension Plan has any Unfunded Pension
Liability; (iii) neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or
reasonably expects to incur, any liability (and no event has occurred which,
with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such
liability) under Section 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer
Plan; and (iv) neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a
transaction that could be subject to Section 4069 or 4212(c) or ERISA.

5.08 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations.  The proceeds of the Loans are to
be used solely for the purposes set forth in and permitted by Section 6.12 and
Section 7.05.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is generally engaged in
the business of purchasing or selling Margin Stock or extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

5.09 Title to Properties.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
indefeasible title in fee simple to, or valid leasehold interests in, all real
property necessary or used in the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses, except for such defects in title as could not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  As of the Closing Date, the
property of the Company and its Subsidiaries is subject to no Liens, other than
Permitted Liens.

5.10 Taxes.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all Federal and
other material tax returns and reports required to be filed, and have paid all
Federal and other material taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental
charges levied or imposed upon them or their properties, income or assets
otherwise due and payable, except those which are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been provided in
accordance with GAAP. There is no proposed tax assessment against the Company or
any Subsidiary that would, if made, have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.11 Financial Condition.  (a) The audited consolidated financial
statements of Weatherford and its Consolidated Subsidiaries dated December 31,
1994, and the related consolidated and consolidating statements of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal year ended on that date: (i)
were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the period
covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly noted therein; (ii) fairly
present the financial condition of Weatherford and its Consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the date thereof and results of operations for the period covered thereby;
and (iii)  except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 5.11, show all material
indebtedness and other liabilities, direct or contingent, of Weatherford and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date thereof, including liabilities for
taxes, material commitments and Contingent Obligations.

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements of Enterra and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries dated December 31, 1994, and the related consolidated
and consolidating statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
the fiscal year

36
<PAGE>

ended on that date: (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly
noted therein; (ii) fairly present the financial condition of Enterra and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and the results of operation
for the period covered thereby; and (iii) except as specifically disclosed in
Schedule 5.11, show all material indebtedness and other liabilities, direct or
contingent, of Enterra and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date thereof,
including liabilities for taxes, material commitments and Contingent
Obligations.

(c) Since December 31, 1994, there has been no Material Adverse
Effect.

(d)  The unaudited pro forma financial information contained in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus of Weatherford and Enterra on Form S-4
(Reg. No. 33-62195), based on the historical consolidated financial statements
identified therein, was prepared based upon assumptions deemed reasonable and
appropriate by Weatherford and Enterra when made; such assumptions continue to
be reasonable and appropriate as of the date of this Agreement; and nothing has
come to the attention of the Company on or before the Closing Date which has
caused, or could reasonably be expected to cause, the unaudited adjusted pro
forma balance sheet contained therein to be misleading in any material respect.

5.12 Environmental Matters.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
monitors in the ordinary course of business the effect of existing Environmental
Laws and existing Environmental Claims on its business, operations and
properties, and as a result thereof the Company has reasonably concluded that,
except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 5.12, such Environmental Laws and
Environmental Claims could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.13 Regulated Entities.  None of the Company, any Person controlling the
Company, or any Subsidiary, is an "Investment Company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, any state public utilities
code, or any other Federal or state statute or regulation limiting, in any such
case, its ability to incur Indebtedness.

5.14 No Burdensome Restrictions.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
a party to or bound by any Contractual Obligation, or subject to any restriction
in any Organization Document, or any Requirement of Law, which could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.15 Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks and Licenses, etc. The Company and its
Subsidiaries own or are licensed or otherwise have the right to use all of the
patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, contractual
franchises, authorizations and other rights that are reasonably necessary for
the operation of their respective businesses, without conflict with the rights
of any other Person (except for any such conflict which could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect).  To the best knowledge of the
Company, no slogan or other advertising device, product, process, method,
substance, part or other material now employed, or now contemplated to be
employed, by the Company or any Subsidiary infringes upon any rights held by any
other Person where

37
<PAGE>

such infringement could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.  Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 5.05, no claim or
litigation regarding any of the foregoing is pending or threatened, and no
patent, invention, device, application, principle or any statute, law, rule,
regulation, standard or code is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
proposed, which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.16 Subsidiaries.  As of the Closing Date (after giving effect to the
Merger), the Company has no Subsidiaries other than those specifically disclosed
in part (a) of Schedule 5.16 hereto and has no equity investments in any other
corporation or entity other than those specifically disclosed in part (b) of
Schedule 5.16.

5.17 Insurance.  The properties of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
are insured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies not
Affiliates of the Company, in such amounts, with such deductibles and covering
such risks as are customarily carried by companies engaged in similar businesses
and owning similar properties in localities where the Company or such Subsidiary
operates.

5.18 Full Disclosure.  None of the representations or warranties made by
the Company or any Subsidiary in the Loan Documents as of the date such
representations and warranties are made or deemed made, and none of the
statements contained in any exhibit, report, statement or certificate furnished
by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the Loan
Documents (including the offering and disclosure materials delivered by or on
behalf of the Company to the Banks prior to the Closing Date), contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading as of the time when made
or delivered.

5.19 Solvency.  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and the Company, individually, each of the other Borrowers and each of the
Guarantors individually, is Solvent.  Each of the Borrowers and each of the
Guarantors has received at least a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for
incurring the obligations to be incurred by it.

other Persons.

document or other matter either sent by the Administrative Agent to such Bank
for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank.

9.05 Notice of Default.  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees
required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks,
unless the Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Bank
or the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default".  The
Administrative Agent will notify the Banks of its receipt of any such notice.
The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as may be requested by the Majority Banks in accordance with
Article IX; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent
has received any such request, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best
interest of the Banks.

9.06 Credit Decision.  Each Bank acknowledges that none of the Agent-
Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act
by any Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Bank.  Each Bank represents to
the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-
Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank
regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Company
and its Subsidiaries hereunder.  Each Bank also represents that it will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make
such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Company, the Borrower, the Guarantors and all other
parties to the Loan Documents.  Except for notices, reports and other documents
expressly herein required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of the Company or its Subsidiaries which may come into the
possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

9.07 Indemnification.  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, the Banks shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons
(to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Company and without
limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), pro rata, from and against any
and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable
for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified
Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the
Agents upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses
(including Attorney Costs) incurred by such Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein,
to the extent that such Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on
behalf of the Company.  The undertaking in this Section shall survive the
payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of any
Agent.

9.08 Agents in Individual Capacities.  TCB, BofA and their respective
Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept
deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of
banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though TCB were not the
Administrative Agent and as if BofA were not the Documentation Agent and without
notice to or consent of the Banks.  The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, TCB, BofA and their respective Affiliates may receive information
regarding the Company or its Affiliates (including information that may be
subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Company or such
Subsidiary) and acknowledge that the Agents shall be under no obligation to
provide such information to them.  With respect to its Loans, each of TCB and
BofA shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other
Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent hereunder.

9.09 Successor Agent.  The Administrative Agent may, and at the request of
the Majority Banks shall, resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to
the Banks, with a copy of such notice to the Company.  If the Administrative
Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Majority Banks shall appoint from among
the Banks a successor agent for the Banks.  If no successor agent is appointed
prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the
Company, a successor agent from among the Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to
all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the
term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring
Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent
shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and
Sections 10.04 and 10.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.  If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative
Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's
notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective

53
<PAGE>

and the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder until such time, if any, as the Majority Banks appoint a successor
agent as provided for above.

9.10 Withholding Tax.

(a) If any Bank is a "foreign corporation, partnership or trust"
within the meaning of the Code and such Bank claims exemption from, or a
reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code, such
Bank agrees with and in favor of the Administrative Agent, to deliver to the
Administrative Agent (with a copy to the Company):

(i) if such Bank claims an exemption from, or a reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, properly completed IRS
Forms 1001 and W-8 before the payment of any interest in the first calendar
year and before the payment of any interest in each third succeeding
calendar year during which interest may be paid under this Agreement;

(ii) if such Bank claims that interest paid under this Agreement
is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is effectively
connected with a United States trade or business of such Bank, two properly
completed and executed copies of IRS Form 4224 before the payment of any
interest is due in the first taxable year of such Bank and in each
succeeding taxable year of such Bank during which interest may be paid
under this Agreement, and IRS Form W-9; and

(iii)  such other form or forms as may be required under the Code
or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or
reduction of, United States withholding tax.

Such Bank agrees to promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
reduction.
(b) If any Bank claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form 1001 and such Bank
sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of
the Obligations to such Bank, such Bank agrees to notify the Administrative
Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of
Obligations to such Bank.  To the extent of such percentage amount, the
Administrative Agent will treat such Bank's IRS Form 1001 as no longer valid.

(c) If any Bank claiming exemption from United States withholding tax
by filing IRS Form 4224 with the Administrative Agent sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations to such
Bank, such Bank agrees to undertake sole responsibility for complying with the
withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code.

(d) If any Bank is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment
to such Bank an amount

54
<PAGE>

equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account such
reduction.  If the forms or other documentation required by subsection (a) of
this Section are not delivered to the Administrative Agent, then the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Bank not
providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the
applicable withholding tax.

(e) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did
not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank
(because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or
because such Bank failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in
circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Bank shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and
including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the
Administrative Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs).  The obligation of the Banks under this subsection
shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement
of the Administrative Agent.

9.11 Documentation Agent; Senior Co-Agent; Co-Agents; Arrangers.  None of
the Banks identified on the facing page, signature pages or otherwise herein of
this Agreement as "Documentation Agent," "Senior Co-Agent," "Co-Agent" or
"Arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or
duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Banks.  Without
limiting the foregoing, none of the Banks so identified as a "Documentation
Agent," "Senior Co-Agent," "Co-Agent" or "Arranger" shall have or be deemed to
have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank.  Each Bank acknowledges that it
has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Banks so identified in deciding
to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

(including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides, by facsimile
transmission, provided that any matter transmitted by the Company, any Borrower,
any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries by facsimile (i) shall be
immediately confirmed by a telephone call to the recipient at the number
specified on Schedule 10.02, and (ii) shall be followed promptly by delivery of

56
<PAGE>

(c) Any agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Banks herein to
receive certain notices by telephone or facsimile is solely for the convenience
and at the request of the Company.  The Administrative Agent and the Banks shall
be entitled to rely on the authority of any Person purporting to be a Person
authorized by the Company or any Borrower to give such notice and the
Administrative Agent and the Banks shall not have any liability to the Company
or any Borrower or other Person on account of any action taken or not taken by
the Administrative Agent or the Banks in reliance upon such telephonic or
facsimile notice.  The obligation of the Company or any Borrower to repay the
Loans shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by the
Administrative Agent and the Banks to receive written confirmation of any
telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by the Administrative Agent and
the Banks of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms understood by
the Administrative Agent and the Banks to be contained in the telephonic or
facsimile notice.

10.03  No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure to exercise and no delay
in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof;  nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, remedy, power or privilege.

10.04  Costs and Expenses.  The Company and the Borrowers jointly and
severally agree that they shall:

(a) whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, pay or reimburse BofA (including in its capacity as Documentation
Agent) and TCB (including in its capacity as Administrative Agent) within five
(5) Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 4.01(g)) for all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by BofA and/or TCB, as applicable, in
connection with the development, preparation, delivery, administration and
execution of, and any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to (in each
case, whether or not consummated), this Agreement, any Loan Document and any
other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by BofA and/or TCB, as applicable, with
respect thereto; and

(b) pay or reimburse the Agents, the Arranger and each Bank within
five (5) Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 4.01(g)) for all
costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by them in connection
with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or
remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document during the existence of
an Event of Default or after acceleration of the Loans (including in connection
with any "workout" or restructuring regarding the Loans, and including in any
Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding).

10.05  Indemnity.  Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Company and each of the Borrowers, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify and hold the Agent-Related Persons, and each Bank and each of its
respective officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact
(each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, charges, expenses and disbursements (including

57
<PAGE>

Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time
(including at any time following repayment of the Loans and the termination,
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or replacement of any
Bank)  be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any document contemplated by or
referred to herein, or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken
or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing,
including with respect to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including
any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Loans or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not
any Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, that the Company and the Borrowers shall
have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to
Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Person. The agreements in this Section shall
survive payment of all other Obligations.

10.06  Payments Set Aside.  To the extent that the Company, any Borrower or
any Guarantor makes a payment to the Administrative Agent or the Banks, or the
Administrative Agent or the Banks exercise their right of set-off, and such
payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof are subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent
or such Bank in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other
party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to
the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if
such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each
Bank severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its Pro
Rata Share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent.

10.07  Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that neither the Company nor any Borrower may
assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Bank.

10.08  Assignments, Participations, etc.

(a) Any Bank may, with the written consent of the Company at all times
other than during the existence of an Event of Default and the Administrative
Agent, which consents of the Company and the Administrative Agent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, at any time assign and delegate to one or more Eligible
Assignees (provided that no written consent of the Company or the Administrative
Agent shall be required in connection with any assignment and delegation by a
Bank to an Eligible Assignee that is an Affiliate of such Bank) (each an
"Assignee") all, or any ratable part of all, of the Loans, the Commitments, and
the other rights and obligations of such Bank hereunder, in a minimum amount of
$10,000,000; provided, however, that the Company, the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent may continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in
connection with the interest so assigned to an Assignee until (i) written notice
of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses and related
information with respect to the Assignee, shall

58
<PAGE>

have been given to the Company and the Administrative Agent by such Bank and the
Assignee; (ii) such Bank and its Assignee shall have delivered to the Company
and the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit
H ("Assignment and Acceptance") together with any Note or Notes subject to such
assignment and (iii) the assignor Bank or Assignee has paid to the
Administrative Agent a processing fee in the amount of $2,500; provided,
further, that in the event a Bank assigns less than all of its interests
hereunder, it shall retain a Commitment of not less than $10,000,000 after the
consummation of the assignment.

(b) From and after the date that the Administrative Agent notifies the
assignor Bank that it has received (and provided its consent with respect to) an
executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the above-referenced
processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a
Bank under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Bank shall, to the extent
that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have
been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its
rights and be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents.

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of notice by the
Administrative Agent that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance
and payment of the processing fee, (and provided that it consents to such
assignment in accordance with subsection 10.08(a)), the Borrowers shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent, new Notes evidencing such Assignee's
assigned Loans and Commitment and, if the assignor Bank has retained a portion
of its Loans and its Commitment, replacement Notes in the principal amount of
the Loans retained by the assignor Bank (such Notes to be in exchange for, but
not in payment of, the Notes held by such Bank).  Immediately upon each
Assignee's making its processing fee payment under the Assignment and
Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only
to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the
resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom. The Commitment
allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the assigning Bank
pro tanto.

(d) Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks or
other Persons not Affiliates of the Company (a "Participant") participating
interests in any Loans, the Commitment of that Bank and the other interests of
that Bank (the "originating Bank") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents;
provided, however, that (i) the originating Bank's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the originating Bank shall remain solely
responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Company, the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with the originating Bank in connection with the originating Bank's
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and
(iv) no Bank shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the
Participant has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver
with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent
such amendment, consent or waiver would require unanimous consent of the Banks
as described in the first proviso to Section 10.01. In the case of any such
participation, the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of Article III
and Section 10.05 as though it were also a Bank hereunder, and if amounts
outstanding

59
<PAGE>

under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall
have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent
as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a
Bank under this Agreement.

(e) Each Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and
exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified
as "confidential" or "secret"  by the Company and provided to it by the Company
or any Subsidiary, or by the Administrative Agent on such Company's or
Subsidiary's behalf, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and
neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such information other than
in connection with or in enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents; except to the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Bank, or
(ii) was or becomes available on a  non-confidential basis from a source other
than the Company, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the Company known to the Bank; provided, however, that any Bank
may disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement
of any Governmental Authority to which the Bank is subject or in connection with
an examination of such Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or
other court process; (C) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which any Agent, any
Bank or their respective Affiliates may be party; (E) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any
other Loan Document; (F) to such Bank's independent auditors and other
professional advisors; (G) to any Affiliate of such Bank, or to any Participant
or Assignee, actual or potential, provided that such Affiliate, Participant or
Assignee agrees to keep such information confidential to the same extent
required of the Banks hereunder, and (H) as to any Bank, as expressly permitted
under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to
which the Company is party or is deemed party with such Bank.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Bank
may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of
its rights under and interest in this Agreement and the Notes held by it in
favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or
U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR (S)203.14, and such Federal Reserve Bank may
enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under
applicable law.

10.09  Set-off.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been
accelerated, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time to time, without
prior notice to the Company or the Borrowers or the Guarantors, any such notice
being waived by the Company and the Borrowers and the Guarantors to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other
indebtedness at any time owing by, such Bank to or for the credit or the account
of the Company or any Borrower or Guarantor against any and all Obligations
owing to such Bank, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not
the Administrative Agent or such Bank shall have made demand under this
Agreement or any Loan Document and

60
<PAGE>

although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.  Each Bank agrees
promptly to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent after any such set-
off and application made by such Bank; provided, however, that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

10.10  Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc.  Each Bank shall
notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any changes in the address to
which notices to the Bank should be directed, of addresses of any Lending
Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it
hereunder and of such other administrative information as the Administrative
Agent shall reasonably request.

10.11  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an
original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute but one and the same instrument.

10.12  Severability.  The illegality or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in
any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

10.13  No Third Parties Benefitted.  This Agreement is made and entered
into for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Company, the Borrowers,
the Banks, the Agents, the Senior Co-Agent, the Co-Agents and the Agent-Related
Persons, and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall
be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect
cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents.

10.14  GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT
OF LAW PRINCIPLES); PROVIDED THAT THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS SHALL RETAIN ALL

OF THIS PROVISION SATISFACTORY TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.  TO THE EXTENT

10.16  Interest.  It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply with
applicable usury laws; accordingly, notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Notes or in any of the other Loan Documents
securing the payment hereof or otherwise relating hereto, in no event shall this
Agreement, the Notes or such other Loan Documents require the payment or permit
the payment, taking, reserving, receiving, collection or charging of any sums
constituting interest under applicable laws, if any, which exceed the maximum
amount permitted by such laws.  If any such excess interest is called for,
contracted for, charged, taken, reserved, or received in connection with the
Loans evidenced by the Notes or in any of the Loan Documents securing the
payment thereof or otherwise relating thereto, or in any communication by the
Agents or the Banks or any other person to any Borrower or any other person, or
in the event all or part of the principal or interest thereof shall be prepaid
or accelerated, so that under any of such circumstances or under any other
circumstance whatsoever the amount of interest contracted for, charged, taken,
reserved, or received on the amount of principal actually outstanding from time
to time under the Notes shall exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by
applicable usury laws, then in any such event it is agreed as follows:  (i) the
provisions of this paragraph shall govern and control, (ii) neither any Borrower
nor any other person or entity now or hereafter liable for the payment of the
Notes shall be obligated to pay the amount of such interest to the extent such
interest is in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable
usury laws, (iii) any such excess which is or has been received notwithstanding
this paragraph shall be credited against the then unpaid principal balance of
the Notes or, if the Notes have been or would be paid in full, refunded to the
applicable Borrower, and (iv) the provisions of this Agreement, the Notes and
the other Loan Documents securing the payment hereof and otherwise relating
hereto, and any communication to any Borrower, shall immediately be deemed
reformed and such excess interest reduced, without the necessity of executing
any other document, to the maximum lawful rate allowed under applicable laws as
now or hereafter construed by courts having jurisdiction hereof or thereof.
Without limiting the foregoing, all calculations of the rate of interest
contracted for, charged, taken, reserved, or received in connection with the
Notes or this Agreement which are made for the purpose of determining whether
such rate exceeds the maximum lawful rate shall be made to the extent permitted
by applicable laws by amortizing, prorating, allocating and spreading during the
period of the full term of the Loans, including all prior and subsequent
renewals and extensions, all interest at any time contracted for, charged,
taken, reserved, or received.  The terms of this paragraph shall be deemed to be
incorporated in every document and communication relating to the Notes, the
Loans or any other Loan Document.

10.17  Company as Subsidiary Borrower Representative.  Each Subsidiary
Borrower hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company as the agent of
such Subsidiary Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents for
the purpose of giving notices and taking other actions delegated to the Company
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Subsidiary Borrower hereby irrevocably grants
to the Company such Subsidiary Borrower's power-of-attorney, and hereby
authorizes the Company, to act in place of such Subsidiary Borrower with respect
to matters delegated to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and to take such other actions as are reasonably
incidental thereto.  The Company hereby agrees to provide prompt notice to the
relevant Subsidiary Borrower of any action taken by the Company under this
Agreement and the other Loan

<PAGE>

Documents in place of such Subsidiary Borrower; provided, that the failure to so
provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of such Subsidiary Borrower
hereunder.  The Agent is hereby authorized to direct to the Company all invoices
and similar statements showing amounts due by the Borrowers hereunder and under
the Notes.

10.18  Indemnity and Subrogation.  In addition to all such rights of
indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law, each
Borrower agrees that in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under
a Guaranty in respect of a Loan to such Borrower, such Borrower shall indemnify
such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be
subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made
to the extent of such payment subject to the provisions of the Guaranty executed
by such Guarantor.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, all rights of the Guarantors under this Section 10.18 and all other
rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation under applicable law or
otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full of the
Obligations.  No failure on the part of a Borrower to make the payments required
by this Section (or any other payments required under applicable law or
otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any
Guarantor with respect to any Guaranty, and each Guarantor shall remain liable
for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor under each such
Guaranty in accordance therewith.

10.19  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement supersedes in its entirety, the
commitment letter dated August 28, 1995, among Weatherford, BofA, TCB and the
Arrangers, which letter is hereby terminated.  The Fee Letter, the
Administrative Agent's Letter and the Invitation Letters remain in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.  This Agreement, together with the
other Loan Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the
Company, the Banks and the Agents, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
agreements and understandings of such Persons, verbal or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

THIS WRITTEN LOAN AGREEMENT, TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER WRITTEN LOAN DOCUMENTS
EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR
SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.

THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed and delivered by their proper and duly authorized officers as of
the day and year first above written.

then-outstanding standard fee schedule, and reimburse Bank for all out-of-pocket
costs, legal fees, and expenses with regard thereto.

2.6 FACILITY FEE. Upon execution of this Agreement, Borrower shall pay
to Bank a nonrefundable loan fee of $20,000 for the Revolving Loan. In addition,
on the first Business Day of each June, September, December, and March,

Agreement, Bank shall make Converting Loan Advances to Borrower from time to
time, on a nonrevolving basis, until the Conversion Date ("Converting Loan"),

Advances shall be evidenced by a promissory note (including all renewals,
modifications, and extensions thereof, the "Converting Note") made by Borrower
to the order of Bank, and shall bear interest as provided in the Converting

to Bank.

and the requested borrowing date. Bank must receive such notice on or before

December, March, and June, beginning the first Business Day of September, 2002,
and continuing through the first Business Day of June, 2004, Borrower shall pay
to Bank installments of principal under the Converting Note, each equal to 5.0%
of the outstanding principal balance of the Converting Note as determined at the

Borrower shall pay to Bank installments of principal under the Converting Note,
each equal to 15% of the outstanding principal balance of the Converting Note as
determined at the close of business on the Conversion Date. All principal and
accrued interest of the Converting Note shall be due and payable in full on June
1, 2005.

3.5 FACILITY FEE. Upon execution of this Agreement, Borrower shall pay

affect the use of any of Borrower's property, and except for other liens
incidental to the conduct of its business or the ownership of its property which
were not incurred in connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of
credit and which do not, in the aggregate, materially impair the value or use of
its property.

6.6 LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in writing to Bank, there is no
threatened (to Borrower's knowledge) or pending litigation, investigation,
arbitration, or administrative action which may materially adversely affect
Borrower's business, property, operations, or financial condition.

6.8 PAYMENT OF TAXES. Except as would not have a material adverse effect
on Borrower, (i) Borrower has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns when
required to be filed (giving effect to any extensions of time therefor); and
(ii) has paid all taxes, assessments, fees, licenses, excise taxes, franchise
taxes, governmental liens, penalties, and other charges levied or assessed

respects with the provisions of ERISA and the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder. Borrower has not engaged in any acts or omissions
which would make Borrower liable in a material amount to the Plan, to any of its
participants, or to the Internal Revenue Service, under ERISA.

6.10 MISREPRESENTATIONS. No written information, exhibits, data, or
reports furnished by or on behalf of Borrower in connection with Borrower's

necessary to make such information, exhibits, data, or reports not misleading.

any material contract, agreement, or instrument to which it is a party.

6.12 NO BURDENSOME RESTRICTIONS. No contract or other instrument to
which Borrower is a party, or order, award, or decree of any court, arbitrator,
or governmental agency, materially impairs Borrower's ability to repay the
Obligations.

performance of any other agreement or obligation for the payment of
borrowed money, for the deferred purchase price of property or services,

payable prior to its stated maturity; and such default continues for 30
days after Borrower receives written notice thereof from the creditor so
affected;

its guaranty of the Obligations, whether with respect to future

Borrower's property is affected by any uninsured loss, damage,
destruction, theft, sale, or encumbrance other than created herein or is

impairs Borrower's financial condition or its ability to pay its debts
as they come due;

(g) Attachment Proceedings and Insolvency. Borrower or any
material portion of Borrower's property is affected by any:

action is necessary to obtain all necessary approvals, registrations,
and filings; or

<PAGE>   22

ARTICLE 10: MISCELLANEOUS

10.1   MANNER OF PAYMENTS.

(a) Payments on Nonbusiness Days. Whenever any event is to occur
or any payment is to be made under any Loan Document on any day other
than a Business Day, such event may occur or such payment may be made on
the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
included in computation of interest in connection with any such payment.

(b) Payments. All payments and prepayments to be made by Borrower
shall be made to Bank when due, at Bank's office as may be designated by
Bank, without offsets or counterclaims for any amounts claimed by
Borrower to be due from Bank, in U.S.
dollars and in immediately available funds.

principal payments under the Notes, will be deducted automatically on
the due date from the Borrower's account number 68892306, or such other
of the Borrower's accounts with Bank as designated in writing by
Borrower. Bank will debit the account on the dates the payments become
due. If a due date does not fall on a Business Day, Bank will debit the
account on the first Business Day following the due date. Borrower will
maintain sufficient funds in the account on the dates Bank enters debits
authorized by this Agreement. If there are insufficient funds in the
account on the date Bank enters any debit authorized by this Agreement,
the debit will be reversed.

(d) Application of Payments. All payments made by Borrower shall
be applied first against fees, expenses, and indemnities due; second,
against interest due; and third, against principal as Borrower may
direct; provided that Bank shall have the right, after a Default which
is continuing, to apply any payments or collections received against any
one or more of the Obligations in any manner which Bank may choose.

(e) Recording of Payments. Bank is authorized to record on a
schedule or computer-generated statement the date and amount of each
Advance, and all payments of principal and interest. All such schedules
or statements shall constitute prima facie evidence of the accuracy of
the information so recorded.

10.2 NOTICES. Bank may make Advances, and changes between interest rate
options, based on telephonic, telex, and oral requests made by any Person whom
Bank in good faith believes to be authorized to act on behalf of Borrower. All
other notices, demands, and other communications to be given pursuant to any of
the Loan Documents shall be in writing and shall be deemed received the earlier
of when actually received, or two days after being mailed, postage prepaid and
addressed as follows, or as later designated in writing:

BANK:                                       BORROWER:

BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.                       ILLUMINET, INC.
Southwest Commercial Banking                4501 Intelco Loop S.E.
820 A Street, Suite 350                     Olympia, WA 98503-5952
Tacoma, WA 98401                            Attention: Daniel E. Weiss, VP & CFO
Attention: Steve Harlow

10.3 DOCUMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES. Borrower shall pay,
reimburse, and indemnify Bank for all of Bank's reasonable costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, all accounting, appraisal, and report preparation
fees or expenses, all attorneys' fees (including the allocated cost of in-house
counsel), legal expenses, and recording or filing fees, incurred in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, and administration of this
Agreement and all other Loan Documents, and all amendments, supplements, or
modifications thereto. Borrower acknowledges that any legal counsel retained or
employed by Bank acts solely on the Bank's behalf and not on Borrower's behalf,
despite Borrower's obligation to reimburse Bank for the cost of such legal
counsel, and that Borrower has had sufficient opportunity to seek the advice of
its own legal counsel with regard to this Agreement.

10.4 COLLECTION EXPENSES. The nonprevailing party shall, upon demand by
the prevailing party, reimburse the prevailing party for all of its costs,
expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (including the allocated cost of
in-house counsel) incurred in connection with any controversy or claim between
said parties relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or
to an alleged tort arising out of the transactions evidenced by this Agreement,
including those incurred in any action, bankruptcy proceeding, arbitration or
other alternative dispute resolution proceeding, or appeal, or in the course of
exercising any judicial or nonjudicial remedies.

10.5 WAIVER. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the
part of Bank, any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the
exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. Further, no waiver or
indulgence by Bank of any Default shall constitute a waiver of Bank's right to
declare a subsequent similar failure or event to be a Default.

10.6 ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement is made expressly for the sole benefit
of Borrower and for the protection of Bank and its successors and assigns. The
rights of Borrower hereunder shall not be assignable by operation of law or
otherwise, without the prior written consent of Bank.

10.7 MERGER. The rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement
shall not merge into or be extinguished by any of the Loan Documents, but shall
continue and remain valid and enforceable. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents constitute Bank's entire agreement with Borrower with regard to the
Revolving Loan, including the Letter of Credit facility thereunder, and the
Converting Loan, and supersede all prior writings and oral negotiations. No oral
or written representation, covenant, commitment, waiver, or promise of either
Bank or Borrower shall have any effect, whether made before or after the date of
this Agreement, unless



18
<PAGE>   24

contained in this Agreement or another Loan Document, or in an amendment
complying with Section 10.8. ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY,
TO EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE NOT
ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

10.8 AMENDMENTS. Any amendment or waiver of, or consent to any departure
by Borrower from any provision of, this Agreement shall be in writing signed by
each party to be bound thereby, and shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

10.9   MANDATORY ARBITRATION.

(a) At the request of either Bank or Borrower, any controversy or
claim between Bank and Borrower, arising from or relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or arising from an alleged
tort, shall be settled by arbitration in Seattle, Washington. The United
States Arbitration Act shall apply even though this Agreement is
otherwise governed by Washington law. The proceedings shall be
administered by the American Arbitration Association under its
commercial rules of arbitration. Any controversy over whether an issue
is arbitrable shall be determined by the arbitrator(s). Judgment upon
the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
over the parties. The institution and maintenance of an action for
judicial relief or pursuit of an ancillary or provisional remedy shall
not constitute a waiver of the right of either party, including the
plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if such
action for judicial relief is contested. For purposes of the application
of the statute of limitations, the filing of an arbitration pursuant to
this subsection is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit, and any
claim or controversy which may be arbitrated under this subsection is
subject to any applicable statute of limitations. The arbitrator(s) will
have the authority to decide whether any such claim or controversy is
barred by the statute of limitations and, if so, to dismiss the
arbitration on that basis. The parties consent to the joinder of any
guarantor, hypothecator, or other party having an interest relating to
the claim or controversy being arbitrated in any proceedings under this
Section.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), no
controversy or claim shall be submitted to arbitration without the
consent of all parties if at the time of the proposed submission, such
controversy or claim arises from or relates to an obligation secured by
real property.

(c) No provision of this subsection shall limit the right of
Borrower or Bank to exercise self-help remedies such as set-off,
foreclosure, retention or sale of any collateral, or obtaining any
ancillary, provisional, or interim remedies from a court of competent
jurisdiction before, after, or during the pendency of any arbitration
proceeding. The exercise of any such remedy does not waive the right of
either party to request arbitration.

10.10 CONSTRUCTION. Each term of this Agreement and each Loan Document
shall be binding to the extent permitted by law and shall be governed by the
laws of the State of



19
<PAGE>   25

Washington, excluding its conflict of laws rules. If one or more of the
provisions of this Agreement should be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any
respect, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain effective and
enforceable. If there is a conflict among the provisions of any Loan Documents,
the provisions of this Agreement shall be controlling. The captions and
organization of this Agreement are for convenience only, and shall not be
construed to affect any provision of this Agreement.

10.11 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and each Loan Document may be signed

CONSENT OF GUARANTOR

The undersigned Affiliate, as guarantor of the Obligations, acknowledges
receipt of a copy of the above Agreement and consents to its contents. Affiliate
agrees to keep accurate and complete books, accounts, and records in which
complete entries shall be made in accordance with GAAP, reflecting all material
financial transactions of Affiliate; provide to Bank the financial reports
required to be provided under Section 7.6; and comply with the covenants set
forth in Sections 7.2 through 7.6 of the Agreement. Affiliate represents and
warrants to Bank as follows:

(a) Affiliate is in good standing as a corporation under the
laws of the state of Delaware, has the power, authority, and legal right
to own and operate its property or lease the property it operates and to
conduct its current business; and is qualified to do business and is in
good standing in the state of Washington and all other jurisdictions
where the ownership, lease, or operation of its property or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to
obtain such qualification would not have a materially adverse effect on
Affiliate's business or its properties, taken as a whole.

(b) Those Loan Documents to be executed by Affiliate, when
executed and delivered by Affiliate, shall be enforceable against
Affiliate in accordance with their respective terms in all material
respects.

(c) The execution, delivery, and performance by Affiliate of
those Loan Documents to which it is a party shall not violate any
existing law or regulation

applicable to Affiliate; any ruling applicable to Affiliate of any
court, arbitrator, or governmental agency or body of any kind;
Affiliate's organizational documents; any security issued by Affiliate;
or any mortgage, indenture, or material lease, contract, undertaking, or
other agreement to which Affiliate is a Party or by which Affiliate or
any of its property may be bound.

(d) By submitting each of the financial statements required by
Section 7.6, Affiliate is deemed to represent and warrant that: (i) such
statement is complete and correct in all material respects and fairly
presents the consolidated financial condition of Affiliate as of the
date of such statement; (ii) such statement discloses all consolidated
liabilities of Affiliate that are required to be reflected or reserved
against under GAAP, whether liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or
contingent; and (iii) such statement has been prepared in accordance
with GAAP. As of this date, there has been no adverse change in
Affiliate's consolidated financial condition since preparation of the
last such financial statements delivered to Bank which would materially
impair Affiliate's ability to perform under its guaranty of the
Obligations.

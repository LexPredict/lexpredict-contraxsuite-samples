the estimated costs and expenses  incurred by the Lender in connection with
the  negotiation  and preparation of this Agreement and the other Financing
Agreements.  Thereafter, the Lender may, in its discretion, make additional
Revolving  Advances  from  time  to time at the  request  of the  Borrower,
provided that (i) such Revolving  Advances shall be made no more frequently
than  once per  month  and no later  than the  fifth  Business  Day of each
calendar month, (ii) such request is made in writing at least ten (10) days
prior to the date on which such Revolving  Advance is to be funded,  and is
accompanied by an executed Compliance Certificate, (iii) such request shall
be for  Revolving  Advances  to pay for  costs  and  expenses  incurred  in
connection with the  installation of the COES  Installations  in accordance
with the Build Out Draw Schedule, and (iv) all borrowings after the Funding
Date  Advances  shall be in multiples  of $100,000.  There shall not be any
recourse  to,  nor  liability  of,  the  Lender  on  account  of any of the
following:  (x) any delay in the Lender's  making of, and/or any decline by
the Lender to make, any Revolving Advance, (y) any delay in the proceeds of
any such Revolving Advance constituting  collected funds, and (z) any delay
in the  receipt,  and/or any loss,  of funds which  constitute  a Revolving
Advance, the wire transfer of which was properly initiated by the Lender in
accordance with wire instructions provided to the Lender by the Borrower.


The  Lender  may rely on any  request  for a  Revolving  Advance  which the
Lender,  in good faith believes to have been made by a person duly authorized to
act on  behalf  of the  Borrower  and may  decline  to make any  such  requested
Revolving  Advance pending the Lender's being furnished with such  documentation
concerning that person's authority to act as may be satisfactory to the Lender.

2.1.2 Loan Account.

(a)  An account  (the "Loan  Account")  shall be opened on the books of the
Lender,  in which Loan  Account a record may be kept of all  Revolving
Advances made by the Lender to the Borrower  under or pursuant to this
Agreement and of all payments thereon.

(b)  The  Lender  may also keep a record  (either  in the Loan  Account  or
elsewhere, as the Lender may from time to time elect) of all interest,
fees,  service  charges,  costs,  expenses,  and other debits owed the
Lender on account of the  Obligations  and of all credits against such
amounts so owed.

(c)  All credits  against the Obligations  shall be conditional  upon final
payment to the Lender of the items  giving rise to such  credits.  The
amount of any item credited  against the Obligations  which is charged
back  against  the Lender for any reason or is not so paid shall be an
Obligation and shall be added to the Loan Account,  whether or not the
item so charged back or not so paid is returned.

(d)  Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees, service charges, costs,
and expenses for which the Borrower is obligated hereunder are payable
on demand. In the  determination of Availability,  the Lender may deem
fees, service charges,  accrued interest, and other payments as having
been advanced under the Revolving  Credit Facility whether or not such
amounts are then due and payable.

(e)  The Lender, without the request of the Borrower, may advance under the
Revolving Credit Facility any interest,  fee, service charge, or other
payment to which the Lender is  entitled  from the  Borrower  pursuant
hereto  and may charge  the same to the Loan  Account  notwithstanding
that such  amount so  advanced  may  result  in  Availability's  being
exceeded. Such action on the part of the Lender shall not constitute a
waiver of the Lender's  rights under  Section 2.1. Any amount which is
added to the principal balance of the Loan Account as provided in this
Subsection  shall bear interest at the interest rate  applicable  from
time  to  time  to the  unpaid  principal  balance  of  the  Revolving
Advances.

(f)  Any  written  statement   rendered  by  the  Lender  to  the  Borrower
concerning the Obligations shall be considered correct and accepted by
the  Borrower  and shall be  conclusively  binding  upon the  Borrower
unless the Borrower provides the Lender with written objection thereto
within  twenty  (20) days from the  mailing of such  statement,  which
written objection shall indicate,  with particularity,  the reason for
such  objection.  The Loan Account and the Lender's  books and records
concerning   the  loan   arrangement   contemplated   herein  and  the
Obligations  shall be prima  facie  evidence  and  proof of the  items
described therein.

2.2  Interest. The Revolving Advances shall bear interest as follows:


2.2.1 Interest Rate. The outstanding  principal amount of the Revolving Advances
shall bear interest at a rate of twenty percent (20%) per annum.  The first
three months of interest  payments due under the Revolving  Credit Facility
shall have been  prepaid to the Lender  pursuant  to the  Prepaid  Interest
Advance.  Thereafter,  the  Borrower  shall  pay  accrued  interest  on the
outstanding  principal  amount of the  Revolving  Advances at the foregoing
rate  monthly in arrears  on the first day of each month  beginning  on the
first day of the fourth month  immediately  following the Funding Date, and
at the Termination  Date (whether by  acceleration or otherwise).  Interest
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year over the actual  number of
days elapsed.

2.2.2 Interest  Upon  Event of  Default.  Upon the  occurrence  and  during  the
continuance  of an  Event  of  Default  (and  whether  or  not  the  Lender
accelerates  payment or exercises  any of Lender's  other rights on account
thereof), interest shall accrue, at the option of the Lender, on the unpaid
Obligations at a rate per annum equal to four (4%) percent in excess of the
rate otherwise applicable to such Obligations, but in no event in excess of
the maximum rate  permitted by  applicable  law.  Interest  accruing at the
foregoing rate shall be due and payable upon demand by the Lender.

2.2.3 Maximum Rate.  Notwithstanding  anything  otherwise in this Section 2.2 or
Section 2.3.2 to the contrary, the rate of interest payable by the Borrower
shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. In the event
the interest paid by the Borrower  shall exceed the maximum lawful rate, at
the  Lender's  option,  the excess  shall be applied  in  reduction  of the
principal balance of the Revolving Advances, or repaid to the Borrower.

2.3  Cash Management; Prepayment; Payments.

2.3.1 Cash  Management.

(a)  Borrower shall establish and maintain,  at its expense,  a lockbox and
related  blocked  account  (the  "Blocked  Account"),  as  Lender  may
specify,  with bank which is acceptable to Lender into which  Borrower
shall  promptly  deposit  and direct its  account  debtors to directly
remit,  on a daily basis,  all payments and receipts in the  identical
form in which such payments and receipts are made or received, whether
by cash, check or other manner. Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered  to  Lender,  a  Deposit  Account  Control   Agreement  duly
authorized,  executed  and  delivered  by such bank where the  Blocked
Account is  maintained  and  Borrower  shall  execute and deliver such
other  agreements  or  documents  as Lender may require in  connection
therewith.  In addition,  Borrower  shall take the necessary  steps to
allow Lender "read only" online access to the Blocked  Account so that
Lender may electronically  monitor the Blocked Account at any time and
from time to time in its discretion.


(b)  Borrower and its  employees  and agents  shall,  acting as trustee for
Lender, receive, as the property of Lender, any monies, checks, notes,
drafts or any other payment  relating to and/or proceeds of Collateral
which  come  into  their   possession   or  under  their  control  and
immediately upon receipt  thereof,  shall deposit or cause the same to
be  deposited in the Blocked  Account,  or remit the same or cause the
same to be remitted, in kind, to Lender. In no event shall the same be
commingled  with  Borrower's own funds.  Borrower  agrees to reimburse
Lender on  demand  for any  amounts  owed or paid to any bank or other
financial  institution at which a Blocked Account or any other deposit
account  or  investment  account  is  established  or any other  bank,
financial  institution  or other  person  involved in the  transfer of
funds to or from the Blocked Account arising out of Lender's  payments
to or  indemnification  of such bank,  financial  institution or other
person.  The  obligation  of  Borrower  to  reimburse  Lender for such
amounts  pursuant to this Section  shall  survive the  termination  or
non-renewal of this Agreement.


(c)  All amounts  deposited in the Blocked Account shall be swept daily and
remitted as follows:  (i) from and after the occurrence of an Event of
Default,  100% of such receipts  shall be remitted to the Lender to be
applied in reduction of the Obligations in a manner  determined by the
Lender  in its  sole  and  exclusive  discretion,  or,  if no Event of
Default has occurred and is  continuing,  then as follows (x) prior to
July  1,  2008,  100%  of  such  receipts  shall  be  remitted  to the
Borrower's Operating Account, and (y) from and after July 1, 2008, the
receipts shall be distributed as set forth in Section 2.3.3(c) below.

2.3.2 Prepayment.  The Borrower  may prepay all or any portion of the  principal
balance of the  Revolving  Advances  from time to time  without  penalty or
premium, provided, however, that in all events and circumstances the Lender
shall be entitled to a minimum  interest payment under the Revolving Credit
Facility equal to the amount of the Prepaid Interest Advance, and therefore
shall retain the funds paid to the Lender pursuant to the Prepaid  Interest
Advance  even if the  Borrower  repays all of the  outstanding  Obligations
under the  Revolving  Credit  Facility  on or before the 90th day after the
Funding Date.

2.3.3 Repayment of  Obligations.  The Borrower  shall repay the  Obligations  as
follows:

(a)  The Borrower,  without notice or demand from the Lender, shall pay the
Lender that amount,  from time to time, which is necessary so that the
aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Advances does
not exceed Availability.

(b)  Accrued interest shall be paid as set forth in Section 2.2, above.

(c)  From and after  July 1,  2008,  on a daily  basis an  amount  equal to
1/30th of the  Borrower's  estimated  EBITDA (as set forth in the Cash
Flow  Projections)  for the then current month (the "Estimated  EBITDA
Payments")  shall be deducted from the Borrower's  receipts  deposited
into the Blocked  Account and  remitted to the Lender to be applied in
reduction of the Obligations,  with the balance of such receipts being
remitted to the Borrower's Operating Account. On the fifth day of each
month,  the  Borrower  shall  provide  the  Lender  with a  "true  up"
calculation of the Borrower's actual EBITDA for the prior month versus
the Estimated  EBITDA Payments made during the prior month pursuant to
the foregoing  sentence.  If the "true up" calculation  indicates that
the aggregate Estimated EBITDA Payments made by the Borrower were less
than 30% of its actual  EBITDA for the prior month,  then the Borrower
shall  promptly  pay the  difference  to the Lender.  If the "true up"
calculation  indicates that the aggregate  Estimated  EBITDA  Payments
made by the Borrower  were more than 30% of its actual  EBITDA for the
prior month to the Lender,  and the aggregate of such Estimated EBITDA
Payments exceed the minimum  $100,000.00  monthly payment set forth in
Section 2.3.3(d) hereof, then the Estimated EBITDA Payments to be made
for the then current month shall be reduced by an  appropriate  amount
until such excess payment is returned to the Borrower. Unless an Event
of Default  has  occurred,  such  amounts  shall be  applied  first in
reduction of the  principal  balance of the  Obligations,  and then in
reduction  accrued  interest,  fees, and expenses.  From and after the
occurrence  of a  Default  or an Event  of  Default,  at the  Lender's
option,  100% of such  receipts  shall be applied in  reduction of the
Obligations  in a  manner  determined  by the  Lender  in its sole and
exclusive  discretion.  Any payments  received by the Lender hereunder
will not be deemed applied in reduction of the Obligations  unless and
until such payments have been received in good and collected funds. In
the  event  that  at any  time  or from  time  to  time  there  are no
Obligations  outstanding,  100% of such receipts  shall be remitted to
the Borrower's Operating Account.

(d)  Commencing  on July 1, 2008,  and  continuing on the first day of each
month thereafter,  the Borrower shall make monthly principal  payments
to the  Lender  in an  amount  (if a  positive  number)  equal  to the
difference  between (i)  $100,000,  and (ii) the  amounts  paid to the
Lender pursuant to Section 2.3.3(c) hereof.

(e)  The Borrower shall repay all Obligations on the Termination Date.

2.3.4 Manner of Payment.  Except as otherwise  expressly set forth  herein,  all
payments  required  to be made by the  Borrower  hereunder  on  account  of
principal, interest, or fees shall be made by wire transfer, in Dollars, in
immediately  available  funds as set forth  herein.  Whenever  any  payment
hereunder,  or under any of the Financing Agreements,  becomes due on a day
on  which  the  Lender  is  closed  (as  required  or  permitted  by law or
otherwise),  such payment shall be made not later than the next  succeeding
Business  Day,  and  such  extension  of  time  shall  be  included  in the
computation of interest.  The Borrower  authorizes  (but shall not require)
the Lender to debit any account  maintained  by the Borrower on any date on
which  a  payment  is due to  the  Lender  hereunder  or  under  any of the
Financing  Agreements,  in an amount  equal to any  unpaid  portion of such
payment.

2.4  Security and Guaranties.

2.4.1 Guaranties. As a condition precedent to the making of the Revolving Credit
Facility  available  to  the  Borrower  hereunder,   each  Guarantor  shall
guarantee  the  Obligations  of the  Borrower  to the Lender  pursuant to a
certain Global  Guaranty  Agreement of even date herewith  executed by each
such Guarantor (the "Guaranty Agreement").

2.4.2 Security.  To secure  repayment  of all  amounts  due under the  Revolving
Credit Facility,  and all of the other  Obligations,  the Borrower and each
Guarantor shall grant valid and perfected  security interests to the Lender
in the Collateral  pursuant to a certain Global Security  Agreement of even
date herewith (the  "Security  Agreement")  and pledge to the Lender all of
their shares, membership interests, and/or other ownership interests in all
of their  respective  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  pursuant  to a certain
Global Pledge Agreement of even date herewith (the "Pledge Agreement"), and
grant valid and perfected  security  interests to the Lender in the portion
of the Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property pursuant to a certain
Intellectual  Property  Security  Agreement of even date  herewith (the "IP
Security Agreement") and grant mortgages (the "Mortgages") to the Lender on
any real property owned by the Borrower and/or each Guarantor.

2.5  Fees.

2.5.1 Monitoring  Fee. On the Funding Date,  the Borrower shall pay the Lender a
monitoring  fee of  $175,000,  which  fee  shall be fully  earned as of the
Funding Date, and used to compensate the Lender for monitoring and managing
the Revolving Credit Facility.

2.5.2 Structuring and Due Diligence Fee. The Borrower shall pay the Lender a fee
in the amount of $35,000,  to reimburse the Lender for the costs,  fees and
expenses  incurred  by the  Lender  in  conducting  its due  diligence  and
structuring  this  transaction.  Such fee shall be fully earned and paid to
the Lender on or before the Funding Date  regardless  of whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.  The fee shall be paid by
a Revolving  Advance  under the  Revolving  Credit  Facility on the Funding
Date. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that this fee is in addition to,
and shall not be applied against,  the legal fees and expenses  incurred by
the  Lender in  connection  with the  negotiation  and  preparation  of the
Financing Agreements.

2.5.3 Grant of Shares.  GS CleanTech,  the parent of the  Borrower,  shall grant
6,000,000  shares of the common stock of GS CleanTech (the "Shares") to the
Lender on or before the Closing Date as  additional  consideration  for the
Lender to make the  Revolving  Credit  Facility  available to the Borrower,
which shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

2.5.4 Unused  Line Fee.  An Unused  Line Fee shall be payable on the last day of
each month,  at the rate of one-half of one percent  (0.50%) per annum,  on
the average daily Availability during such month.

2.5.5 Override.  The Lender shall receive an override fee of $0.10 per gallon of
corn oil extracted by Borrower from the COES Installations, which fee shall
be payable monthly,  on the first day of each month, until the later of (i)
the  Termination  Date, or (ii) the date upon which the Lender has received
such fee on a total of twenty million (20,000,000) gallons of corn oil.

2.6  Extension of Maturity Date; Termination. The Maturity Date of the Revolving
Credit Facility may be extended for twelve (12) months at the discretion of
the Lender,  provided  that (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing,  and (ii) the Borrower provides the Lender with at least
thirty (30) days prior written notice of its request to extend the Maturity
Date.  This  Agreement  may be  terminated by the Borrower at any time upon
thirty  (30) days prior  written  notice to the  Lender,  provided  that no
termination of this  Agreement  shall  relieve,  release,  or discharge the
Borrower  or  Guarantors  of  their  respective  duties,  obligations,  and
covenants  under this Agreement and the other Financing  Agreements,  or to
terminate  any Liens or security  interests  granted to the  Lender,  or to
otherwise  release any Collateral,  unless and until all  Obligations  have
been fully and finally  discharged and paid (in good and collected  funds).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all representations,  warranties, covenants,
indemnifications,  and agreements  which by their express terms survive the
termination of this Agreement and/or the Financing  Agreements shall not be
affected by such termination and shall remain in full force and effect.

and has all requisite right, power and authority and all necessary licenses
and permits to own and operate  its assets and  properties  and to carry on
all business  activities  now  conducted  and as  presently  proposed to be
conducted.  The Borrower and each  Guarantor  has  qualified and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as the case
may be,  in each  state or  other  jurisdiction  where  the  nature  of its
business  or  the   ownership  or  use  of  its  property   requires   such
qualification,  except such jurisdictions,  if any, in which the failure to
be so qualified  will not have a material and adverse  effect on either the
conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties.

4.2  Authorization.  The Borrower and each  Guarantor  have all requisite  legal
right,  power and  authority to execute,  deliver and perform the terms and
provisions of this Agreement,  the other Financing  Agreements  executed by
it, and all other instruments and documents delivered by it pursuant hereto
and thereto.  The Borrower  and each  Guarantor  have taken or caused to be
taken all  necessary  action  to  authorize  the  execution,  delivery  and
performance of this Agreement,  the other Financing  Agreements executed by
it and any other related agreements,  instruments or documents delivered or

hereto and thereto. This Agreement, the other Financing Agreements executed
by the Borrower and each Guarantor and all related agreements,  instruments
or  documents  delivered  or to be  delivered  pursuant  hereto or  thereto

contemplated,  nor compliance with the provisions  hereof or thereof,  will
violate any law, statute or regulation, or any order, writ or decree of any
court or governmental instrumentality,  or will conflict with, or result in
the breach of, or constitute a default in any respect under, any indenture,
mortgage,  deed of  trust,  agreement  or other  instrument  to  which  the

Revolving  Credit  Facility will be used,  directly or indirectly,  for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock or for any other purpose
that  might  constitute  this  transaction  a "purpose  credit"  within the
meaning of such  Regulation U. The Borrower  will not take,  nor permit any

hereafter.

schedules  annexed  thereto).  Such financial  statements  were prepared in
accordance with GAAP and present fairly the financial  position and results
of  operations  of the  Borrower  as of the  dates  of and for the  periods

contingent,  of the  Borrower as of the date of such  financial  statements
that were not reflected  therein or in the notes thereto in accordance with
GAAP. There has been no material adverse change since September 30, 2007 in

statement  and prior to the date hereof,  except for those  properties  and
assets which have been  disposed of since such date in the ordinary  course
of  business.  All such  properties  and  assets are owned or leased by the

execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement,  or the  consummation  of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

4.16 Disclosure. No certificate,  statement,  report or other document furnished

spill or discharge,  threatened or actual, of any Hazardous Material or the
generation, use, storage, treatment, transportation, manufacture, handling,
production   or  disposal  of  any   Hazardous   Materials   or  any  other

conducted.  As of the date hereof,  Borrower does not have any Intellectual
Property  registered,  or subject to  pending  applications,  in the United
States Patent and Trademark  Office or any similar  office or agency in the
United States, any State thereof,  any political  subdivision thereof or in
any other country,  other than those  described in Schedule 4.20 hereto and

dates  of the  expiration  of such  agreements  or  other  arrangements  of
Borrower as in effect on the date hereof (collectively,  together with such
agreements or other  arrangements  as may be entered into by Borrower after
the date hereof, collectively, the "License Agreements" and individually, a
"License  Agreement").  No  trademark,  servicemark,   copyright  or  other
Intellectual  Property  at any  time  used by  Borrower  which  is owned by
another  person,  or owned by Borrower  subject to any  security  interest,
lien,  collateral  assignment,  pledge or other encumbrance in favor of any
person other than Lender. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower is party
to that certain  License  Agreement  dated  December  ___,  2007 (the "COES
License  Agreement")  executed by and between Borrower's parent company, GS
Ethanol,  and pursuant  thereto holds the  intellectual  property rights to

COES  Installation  located  at Utica  Energy,  LLC,  4995  State  Road 91,

Environmental  Law,  Borrower  shall,  at Lender's  request and  Borrower's
expense:  (a)  cause  an  independent   environmental  engineer  reasonably
acceptable  to Lender to conduct  such  tests of the site where  Borrower's
non-compliance or alleged non compliance with such  Environmental  Laws has
occurred  as to such  non-compliance  and  prepare  and deliver to Lender a
report as to such non-compliance setting forth the results of such tests, a
proposed  plan  for  responding  to any  environmental  problems  described
therein,  and an estimate of the costs  thereof and (b) provide to Lender a
supplemental   report  of  such   engineer   whenever  the  scope  of  such
non-compliance,  or  Borrower's  response  thereto or the  estimated  costs
thereof, shall change in any material respect. Borrower shall indemnify and
hold harmless Lender, its directors, officers, employees, agents, invitees,
representatives,  successors  and  assigns,  from and  against  any and all

Agreement,  Lender shall have, and is hereby granted, the irrevocable right
and authority,  at its option, to renew or extend the term of such material
License  Agreement,  whether in its own name and behalf, or in the name and
behalf of a  designee  or  nominee  of Lender or in the name and  behalf of
Borrower,  as Lender  shall  determine at any time that an Event of Default

or  thereunder  preclude  any  other or  further  exercise  thereof  or the
exercise of any other right,  power and privilege.  The rights and remedies

Agreement and the other Financing  Agreements (except as otherwise provided
therein)  and any  dispute  arising  out of the  relationship  between  the
parties hereto,  whether in contract,  tort, equity or otherwise,  shall be
governed by the internal  laws of the State of New Jersey but excluding any

of New Jersey.

8.7  Successors.  This Agreement,  the other Financing  Agreements and any other
document  referred to herein or therein  shall be binding upon and inure to

the Lender.

8.8  Partial  Invalidity.  If any  provision  of  this  Agreement  or the  other
Financing  Agreements  is  held  to  be  invalid  or  unenforceable,   such
invalidity or  unenforceability  shall not invalidate this Agreement or the
other Financing  Agreements as a whole but this Agreement or the particular
Financing  Agreement,  as the case may be,  shall be construed as though it
did not contain the particular  provision or provisions  held to be invalid
or  unenforceable  and the rights and  obligations  of the parties shall be
construed and enforced only to such extent as shall be permitted by law.

8.9  Headings and Word  Meanings.  The headings used herein are for  convenience
only and do not constitute  matters to be considered in  interpreting  this
Agreement.  The words "herein,"  "hereinabove,"  "hereof," and "hereunder,"

context  otherwise  requires.  The singular  shall include the plural,  the
masculine  gender shall include the feminine and neuter and the disjunctive
shall include the conjunctive, and vice versa, unless the context otherwise
requires.

8.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LITIGATION IN ANY COURT WITH RESPECT TO, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR ARISING OUT
OF  THIS  AGREEMENT,  THE  OTHER  FINANCING  AGREEMENTS  OR ANY  AGREEMENT,
INSTRUMENT  OR  DOCUMENT  DELIVERED  PURSUANT  HERETO  OR  THERETO,  OR THE
VALIDITY,  PROTECTION,   INTERPRETATION,   ADMINISTRATION,   COLLECTION  OR
ENFORCEMENT  HEREOF OR THEREOF,  OR ANY OTHER CLAIM OR DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR
THEREUNDER.  THIS  PROVISION  IS A  MATERIAL  INDUCEMENT  FOR THE  PARTIES'
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

8.11 JURISDICTION;  SERVICE OF PROCESS.  Borrower and Lender irrevocably consent
and submit to the non-exclusive  jurisdiction of the Superior Courts of the
State of New Jersey  sitting in Hudson County,  New Jersey,  and the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey sitting in Newark, New
Jersey,  whichever Lender may elect, and waive any objection based on venue
or forum non  conveniens  with  respect  to any action  instituted  therein
arising under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Agreements or in
any way  connected  with or related or  incidental  to the  dealings of the
parties hereto in respect of this  Agreement or any of the other  Financing
Agreements  or the  transactions  related  hereto or thereto,  in each case
whether now existing or hereafter arising,  and whether in contract,  tort,
equity or  otherwise,  and agree that any dispute  with respect to any such
matters  shall be heard only in the courts  described  above  (except  that
Lender  shall  have the right to bring any  action  or  proceeding  against
Borrower  or its  property  in the courts of any other  jurisdiction  which
Lender deems necessary or appropriate in order to realize on the Collateral
or to otherwise  enforce its rights against  Borrower or its property).  In
any such  litigation,  the Borrower waives personal service of any summons,
complaint or other process and agrees that the service  thereof may be made
by  certified  mail  directed  to it at its address  set forth  herein,  or
designated  in writing  pursuant to, this  Agreement or in any other manner
permitted by the rules of either of said courts.

8.12 Indemnity.  Borrower  shall  indemnify and hold Lender,  and its directors,
agents,  employees  and  attorneys,  harmless  from and against any and all
losses,  claims,  damages,   liabilities,   costs  or  expenses  (including
attorneys'  fees and legal  expenses)  imposed on,  incurred by or asserted
against any of them in connection with any litigation, investigation, claim
or  proceeding   commenced  or  threatened   related  to  the  negotiation,
preparation,    execution,    delivery,    enforcement,    performance   or
administration of this Agreement,  any other Financing  Agreements,  or any
undertaking or proceeding  related to any of the transactions  contemplated
hereby or any act,  omission,  event or  transaction  related or  attendant
thereto,  including  amounts paid in settlement,  court costs, and the fees
and expenses of counsel.  To the extent that the  undertaking to indemnify,
pay and hold  harmless  set  forth  in this  Section  may be  unenforceable
because  it  violates  any law or  public  policy,  Borrower  shall pay the
maximum portion which it is permitted to pay under applicable law to Lender
in  satisfaction of indemnified  matters under this Section.  To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Borrower shall not assert, and Borrower hereby
waives, any claim against Lender, on any theory of liability,  for special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
damages)  arising  out of, in  connection  with,  or as a result  of,  this
Agreement,  any of the other  Financing  Agreements or any  undertaking  or
transaction  contemplated  hereby. No indemnitee referred to above shall be
liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any
information    or   other    materials    distributed    by   it    through
telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other Financing  Agreements or
the transaction  contemplated hereby or thereby. All amounts due under this
Section shall be payable upon demand. The foregoing indemnity shall survive
the payment of the  Obligations  and the termination or non-renewal of this
Agreement.

8.13 Marshalling; Recourse to Security; Payments Set Aside. The Lender shall not
be under any  obligation  to marshal any assets in favor of the Borrower or
any other  party or against or in payment of any or all of the  Obligations
of the Borrower to the Lender  hereunder or under the Financing  Agreements
or  otherwise.  Recourse to security  shall not be required at any time. To
the extent that the Borrower makes a payment or payments to the Lender,  or
the Lender exercises its rights of set-off, and such payment or payments or
the  proceeds  of  such  set-off  or  any  part  thereof  are  subsequently
invalidated,  declared to be fraudulent or  preferential,  set aside and/or
required  to be repaid to a trustee,  receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause,  then,
to the extent of such recovery,  the obligation or part thereof  originally
intended to be  satisfied,  and all liens,  rights and  remedies  therefor,
shall be revived and  continued in full force and effect as if such payment
had not been made or such set-off had not occurred.

8.14 Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement,  the other Financing  Agreements,  any
supplements hereto or thereto,  and any instruments or documents  delivered
or to be delivered in connection herewith or therewith represent the entire
agreement  and  understanding  concerning  the  subject  matter  hereof and
thereof  between  the  parties  hereto,   and  supersede  all  other  prior
agreements, understandings,  negotiations and discussions, representations,
warranties,  commitments,  proposals,  offers and contracts  concerning the
subject  matter  hereof,  whether  oral or  written.  In the  event  of any
inconsistency  between  the terms of this  Agreement  and any  schedule  or
exhibit hereto, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.

8.15 Set-off.  In  addition  to any  rights  and  remedies  of the Lender now or
hereafter  provided by law, the Lender shall have the right,  without prior
notice to the  Borrower,  any such  notice  being  expressly  waived by the
Borrower to the extent  permitted by applicable  law, on the occurrence and
during  the  continuation  of any  Event of  Default  to set off and  apply
against any Obligation,  whether  matured or immature,  of the Borrower any
amount owing from the Lender to the  Borrower,  at or at any time after the
happening  of any such Event of  Default,  and such right of set-off may be
exercised  by the Lender  against  the  Borrower  or against any trustee in
bankruptcy,  debtor-in-possession,  assignee for the benefit or  creditors,
receiver,  or execution,  judgment or  attachment  creditor of any of them,
notwithstanding  the fact that such  right of  set-off  shall not have been
exercised by the Lender before the making,  filing or issuance,  or service
on the Lender, of, or of notice of, any such event or proceeding.

8.16 Waiver of Notices.  Borrower hereby expressly  waives demand,  presentment,
protest and notice of protest and notice of  dishonor  with  respect to any
and all instruments and chattel paper, included in or evidencing any of the
Obligations or the Collateral, and any and all other demands and notices of
any  kind  or  nature  whatsoever  with  respect  to the  Obligations,  the
Collateral and this  Agreement,  except such as are expressly  provided for
herein.  No notice to or demand on Borrower  which Lender may elect to give
shall  entitle  Borrower  to any other or  further  notice or demand in the
same, similar or other circumstances.

8.17 Counterparts;  Facsimile  Signature.  This  Agreement  may be  executed  in
counterparts,  each of which shall  constitute an original but all of which
when taken  together shall  constitute  but one contract,  and shall become
effective  when  copies  hereof  which,  when  taken  together,   bear  the
signatures of each of the parties  hereto shall be delivered to the Lender.
Delivery of an executed  counterpart  of a signature page to this Agreement
by  telecopier  shall be  effective  as  delivery  of a  manually  executed
signature page hereto.

if less, the unpaid principal amount of all Revolving  Advances made pursuant to
the Credit Agreement (as defined below).


This  Note  is the  Revolving  Note  referred  to in  that  certain  Credit

such agreement may be further amended from time to time the "Credit Agreement"),
and is subject to prepayment  and its maturity is subject to  acceleration  upon

The outstanding  unpaid principal  balance of this Note shall bear interest
at the rate per annum  provided  for in the Credit  Agreement.  Interest on this
Note shall be payable  monthly on the first day of each month  commencing on the

If any payment on this Note becomes due and payable on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding day on which
those  offices  are open,  and if the date for any  payment of  principal  is so
extended, interest thereon shall be payable for the extended time.


The Borrower hereby waives  diligence,  presentment,  protest and notice of
any kind, and assents to extensions of the time of payment,  release,  surrender
or substitution of security, or forbearance or other indulgence, without notice.


This Note may not be changed, modified or terminated orally, but only by an
agreement  in  writing  signed by the  Borrower  and the  Lender,  or any holder
hereof.


This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance  with, the laws
of the State of New Jersey, and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns
of the  Borrower  and  inure  to the  benefit  of the  Lender,  its  successors,
endorsees  and  assigns.  If any term or  provisions  of this note shall be held
invalid,  illegal  or  unenforceable,  the  validity  of  all  other  terms  and
provisions thereof shall in no way be affected thereby.

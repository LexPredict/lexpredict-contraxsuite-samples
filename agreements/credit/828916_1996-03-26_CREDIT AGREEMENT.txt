date of honor of such draft. In the event of a Purchase Drawing under
a Special Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms of such Letter
of Credit, the Borrower hereby promises and agrees to pay to the Agent
for the account of the Issuing Bank, notwithstanding paragraph (d) of
this Section 2.03, by 9:00 A.M. (Houston, Texas time) on the 30th day
after the date of honor of such Purchase Drawing (the "Payment Date"),
the full amount of all principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on
each Liquidity Bank Bond, plus the Interest Differential, if any, at
such time (the "Purchase Price"), in immediately available funds,
unless the Issuing Bank shall have been previously reimbursed for the
amount thereof as a result of remarketing of such Liquidity Bank Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Remarketing
Agreement before such date. Upon receipt of payment of an amount equal
to the Purchase Price by the Agent for the account of the Issuing
Bank, the Agent shall notify the Tender Agent to deliver the Liquidity
Bank Bonds to the Borrower if such payment was made by

<PAGE>

or on behalf of the Borrower, and otherwise to the Remarketing Agent,
in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Remarketing
Agreement. Each Bank shall, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement (including the occurrence and continuance of a Default
or an Event of Default), make available to the Agent for the benefit
of the Issuing Bank an amount equal to its Pro Rata Percentage of the
amount of the presented draft under the respective Special Letter of
Credit on the date on which such draft shall have been honored by the
Issuing Bank. If such amount is not in fact made available to the
Agent by any such Bank on such date, then such Bank shall pay to the
Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, on demand made by the
Issuing Bank, in addition to such amount, an amount equal to the
product of (i) the average daily Effective Federal Funds Rate per
annum during the period referred to in clause (iii) of this sentence
times (ii) the amount of such Bank's Pro Rata Percentage of the amount
of the presented draft times (iii) the number of days that elapse from
the day the Issuing Bank has honored such draft to the date on which
the amount equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Percentage of the amount of
the presented draft becomes immediately available to the Issuing Bank
divided (iv) by 360. The Liquidity Bank Bonds shall, in accordance
with the applicable Indenture, as of the date of payment of such
draft, bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to the
lesser of (i) the Prime Rate per annum or (ii) the Maximum Rate. In
the event that the Purchase Price for Liquidity Bank Bonds shall not
have been paid by the Payment Date as required hereunder, and the
Issuing Bank shall not have been otherwise reimbursed, the portion of
the Purchase Price not paid or reimbursed, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement (including the occurrence and the
continuance of a Default or an Event of Default), shall be deemed
automatically and without any action by the Borrower to be an Advance
in an amount equal to such portion of the Purchase Price not paid or
reimbursed (including, without limitation, the Interest Differential,
if any) which is immediately due and payable, bearing interest at a
rate per annum equal to the lesser of the Prime Rate, plus 1.00% per
annum, or the Highest Lawful Rate, and the Borrower shall be deemed to
have purchased such Liquidity Bank Bonds. Such Advance shall be deemed
a payment by Borrower of an amount equal to the Purchase Price to the
Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank. The Agent shall promptly
notify the Tender Agent to deliver the Liquidity Bank Bonds to the
Agent for the benefit of Borrower to be held by the

<PAGE>

Agent as collateral securing such Advance. The Borrower hereby grants
to the Agent, for the benefit of each Bank, a Lien on and a security
interest in such Liquidity Bank Bonds, until such time as such Advance
shall have been paid in full. Each drawing on a Special Letter of
Credit other than a Purchase Drawing and the reimbursement obligation
of the Borrower in respect thereof, shall, notwithstanding the
delivery of Bonds in respect thereof to the Tender Agent as custodian
for the Banks, be governed by paragraph (d) of this Section 2.03.
Nothing in this paragraph (i) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
diminish the Borrower's obligation under this Agreement to provide the
funds for the payment of, or on demand to reimburse the Issuing Bank
for payment of, any draft presented to, and duly honored by, the
Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit at the time and in the manner
provided under this Section 2.03 for each Letter of Credit, including
without limitation, the Special Letters of Credit, and the automatic
funding of an Advance as in this paragraph provided shall not
constitute a cure or waiver of the Event of Default for failure to
timely provide such funds as in this paragraph agreed.

(j) Other than for purposes of calculation of the principal amount
of Letters of Credit issued and outstanding under Section 2.01 of this
Agreement, each drawing honored in accordance with Section 2.03(i)
shall automatically reduce the Letter of Credit Amount of the
applicable Special Letter of Credit; provided that (i) with respect to
any Partial Drawing, the Letter of Credit Amount shall be
automatically increased immediately following such payment by the
amount paid for accrued interest on the Bonds (other than such
interest component attributable to the Bonds, the principal of which
was paid with the proceeds of such drawing) in connection therewith
(provided that such automatic reinstatement shall be revoked upon
notice from the Agent to the Credit Facility Trustee, at the request
of the Majority Banks, of such revocation within seven (7) calendar
days from and after the date on which such drawing was honored), and
(ii) with respect to any Purchase Drawing, the Letter of Credit Amount
shall be automatically increased by an amount equal to (x) the amount
drawn by such Purchase Drawing upon reimbursement of such amount to
the Issuing Bank, less (y) the portion of the amount in clause (x)
hereof representing principal and interest attributable to any
Liquidity Bank Bonds, or Bonds held at such time in the name of the
Borrower, the Issuer or the User. The Agent shall provide notice to
the Credit Facility Trustee and the Trustee of receipt of funds in

<PAGE>

respect of reimbursement for each drawing under a Special Letter of
Credit which has been honored by the Issuing Bank, specifying the date
and amount of such reimbursement, and of the related drawing; provided
that, failure to provide such notice shall not diminish the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder.

(k) The obligations of the Borrower in respect of the Special
Letters of Credit shall be governed in all respects by the terms and
provisions of the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Third
Amendment.

(d) Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to add the
following new subsection (d) to the end of said Section 3.01:

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
proceeds of amounts paid to the Issuing Bank for reimbursement of a
drawing under a Special Letter of Credit honored by the Issuing Bank
shall be promptly thereafter distributed by the Agent to each Bank in
accordance with such Bank's Pro Rata Percentage interest in such
Special Letter of Credit for reduction of principal or interest
outstanding, as the case may be, with respect to such Bank's
participation in such drawing.

(e) Section 7.12 of the Credit Agreement shall be amended by deleting
the first sentence following clause (iv) in said Section 7.12, and substituting
in lieu thereof the following:

Notwithstanding the above, and in any event, except for (i) Guaranties
by the Borrower of indebtedness or obligations of any Subsidiary, or
(ii) Guaranties of any Subsidiary of indebtedness or obligations of
the Borrower, or (iii) the Guaranty by the Borrower of the obligations
of the Dugas Partnership In Commendam in respect of the Series 1995
Lafayette Bonds and the Special Letter of Credit issued in connection
therewith, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary shall enter into
any Guaranty (other than checks deposited and/or endorsed in the
ordinary course of business of the Borrower or any Subsidiary) unless
(A) liability incurred by the Borrower or such Subsidiary under such
Guaranty is secured and is for a Primary Obligor's indebtedness or
other obligation, and (B) upon payment by the Borrower or such
Subsidiary on account of (or in connection with) its obligations under
the Guaranty or, after compliance with

<PAGE>

applicable foreclosure proceedings specified by law or otherwise
agreed upon, the Borrower or such Subsidiary will become subrogated to
the right, title and interests of the beneficiary of the Guaranty or
of the Primary Obligor, to all Property securing such liability.

ARTICLE
II

AMOUNTS
AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES



Section
2.01  The
A Advances.
Each
Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth,
to
make A Advances to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during
the
period from the Effective Date until the Termination Date of such Lender in
an
aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount set opposite
such Lender's name on Schedule II hereto or, if such Lender has entered into
any
Assignment and Acceptance, set forth for such Lender in the Register maintained
by the Agent pursuant to Section 8.07(c), as such amount may be reduced pursuant
to Section 2.05 (such Lender's “Commitment”), provided
that the
aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be deemed used from
time to time to the extent of the aggregate amount of the B Advances then
outstanding and at any time of determination, such deemed use of the aggregate
amount of the Commitments shall be applied to the Lenders ratably according
to
their respective Commitments in effect at such time of determination (such
deemed use of the aggregate amount of the Commitments being a “B Reduction”).
Each A Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 or
an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and shall consist of A
Advances of the same Type made on the same day to the Borrower by the Lenders
ratably according to their respective Commitments. Within the limits of each
Lender's Commitment, the Borrower may from time to time borrow, until the
Commitment Termination Date, prepay pursuant to Section 2.06(c) and reborrow
under this Section 2.01.



Section
2.02  Making
the A Advances.



(a)  Each
A
Borrowing shall be made on notice by the Borrower, given not later than (x)
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of a proposed A Borrowing consisting
of Base Rate Advances and (y) 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the third
Business Day prior to the date of a proposed A Borrowing consisting of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof
by telecopier, mail or delivery. Each such notice of an A Borrowing (a “Notice
of A Borrowing”) shall be by telecopier, mail or delivery, confirmed immediately
in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, specifying therein
the requested (i) date of such A Borrowing, (ii) Type of A Advances
comprising such A Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such A Borrowing,
and (iv) in the case of an A Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the initial Interest Period for each such A Advance. The Borrower
may,
subject to the conditions herein provided, borrow more than one A Borrowing
on
any Business Day. Each Lender shall, before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time)
in
the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances and before 11:00 A.M.
(New York City time) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, in each case on the date of such A Borrowing, make available for
the
account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at its address referred
to
in Section 8.02, in same day funds, such















12





















Lender's
ratable portion of such A Borrow-ing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds
and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III,
the
Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid
address.



(b)  Anything
in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding,



(i)  the
Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any A Borrowing or with
respect to the Conversion or continuance of any A Borrowing if the aggregate
amount of such A Borrowing or such Conversion or continuance is less than
$5,000,000;



(ii)  there
shall be no more than five Interest Periods relating to Eurodollar Rate Advances
outstanding at any time;



(iii)  if
any
Lender shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or
in
the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any
central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for
such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations
hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Advances hereunder, the Commitment of such Lender to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to Convert all or any portion of Base Rate Advances shall forthwith
be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower that such Lender has
determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and
such Lender's then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Advances, if any, shall be Base
Rate Advances; to the extent that such affected Eurodollar Rate Advances become
Base Rate Advances, all payments of principal that would have been otherwise
applied to such Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be applied instead to such
Lender's Base Rate Advances; provided
that if
Majority Lenders are subject to the same illegality or assertion of illegality,
then the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such
A
Borrowing or any subsequent A Borrowing or to Convert all or any portion of
Base
Rate Advances shall forthwith be suspended until the Agent shall notify the
Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and
each A Advance comprising such A Borrowing shall be a Base Rate
Advance;



(iv)  if
the
Majority Lenders shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any
requested A Borrowing, notify the Agent that the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for
Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising such A Borrowing will not adequately reflect
the cost to such Majority Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their
respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for such A Borrowing, the right of the
Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for such A Borrowing or any
subsequent A Borrowing shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist, and each A Advance comprising such A Borrowing shall be made
as a
Base Rate Advance.



(c)  Each
Notice of A Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower
requesting the proposed A Borrowing. In the case of any A Borrowing which the
related Notice of A Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the Borrower requesting the proposed A Borrowing shall indemnify
each
Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender by reason
of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits















13





















or
other
funds acquired by such Lender to fund the A Advance to be made by such Lender
as
part of such A Borrowing or by reason of the termination of hedging or other
similar arrangements, in each case when such A Advance is not made on such
date,
including without limitation, as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before
the date specified in such Notice of A Borrowing for such A Borrowing the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III.



(d)  Unless
the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to any A Borrowing
that
such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion
of such A Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion
available to the Agent on the date of such A Borrowing in accordance with
subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.
If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable
portion available to the Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree
to
repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available
to
the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in
the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to A Advances
comprising such A Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the
Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding
amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's A Advance as part
of such A Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.



(e)  The
failure of any Lender to make the A Advance to be made by it as part of any
A
Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any,
hereunder to make its A Advance on the date of such A Borrowing, but no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the A Advance
to be made by such other Lender on the date of any A Borrowing.



Section
2.03  The
B Advances.
(a) Each
Lender severally agrees that the Borrower may make B Borrowings under this
Section 2.03 from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
date hereof until the date occurring 30 days prior to the latest Commitment
Termination Date of any Lender then in effect in the manner set forth below;
provided
that,
(i) following the making of each B Borrowing, (1) the aggregate amount
of the Advances then outstanding to the Borrower shall not exceed the aggregate
amount of the Commitments of the Lenders then in effect (computed without regard
to any B Reduction), and (2) the aggregate amount of the B Advances
scheduled to be outstanding to the Borrower at any time through the maturity
of
such B Advances shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of
the
Lenders scheduled to be in effect at such time (computed without regard to
any B
Reduction), and (ii) no Lender may make a B Advance if the maturity date of
such B Advance occurs after the Commitment Termination Date of such
Lender.



(i)  The
Borrower may request a B Borrowing under this Section 2.03 by delivering to
the
Agent, by telecopier or delivery, confirmed immediately in writing, a notice
of
a B Borrowing (a “Notice of B Borrowing”), in substantially the form of Exhibit
A-2 hereto, specifying the date and aggregate amount of the proposed B
Borrowing, the maturity date for repayment of each B Advance to be made as
part
of such B Borrowing (which maturity date (x) in the case of a fixed rate B
Borrowing may not be earlier than the date occurring 14 days after the date
of
such B Borrowing or later than the date occurring 180 days after the date of
such B Borrowing, and (y) in the case of any other B















14





















Borrowing
may not be earlier than the date occurring 30 days after the date of such B
Borrowing or later than the date occurring 180 days after the date of such

City time) (A) at least one Business Day prior to the date of the proposed
B Borrowing, if the Borrower shall specify in the Notice of B Borrowing that
the
rates of interest to be offered by the Lenders shall be fixed rates per annum
and (B) at least four Business Days prior to the date of the proposed B
Borrowing, if the Borrower shall instead specify in the Notice of B Borrowing
the basis to be used by the Lenders in determining the rates of interest to
be
offered by them. The Borrower may not select a maturity date for any B Borrowing
which ends after the latest Commitment Termination Date of any Lender then
in
effect. The Agent shall in turn promptly notify each Lender of each request
for
a B Borrowing received by it from the Borrower by sending such Lender a copy
of
the related Notice of B Borrowing.



(ii)  Each
Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to do so, irrevocably offer
to
make one or more B Advances to the Borrower as part of such proposed B Borrowing
at a rate or rates of interest specified by such Lender in its sole discretion,
by notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower),
before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) (A) on the date of such proposed B

rate or rates of interest therefor and such Lender's Applicable Lending Office

to
make any such offer, it shall notify the Borrower of such offer before 10:00

such an offer, such Lender shall so notify the Agent, before 10:00 A.M. (New

to
the Agent by the other Lenders, and such Lender shall not be obligated to,
and
shall not, make any B Advance as part of such B Borrowing; provided
that the
failure by any Lender to give such notice shall not cause such Lender to be
obligated to make any B Advance as part of such proposed B
Borrowing.



(iii)  The
Borrower shall, in turn, (A) before 12:00 noon (New York City time) on
the date of such proposed B Borrowing, in the case of a Notice of B Borrowing

Borrowing delivered by the Borrower pursuant to paragraph (i) above), and reject

paragraph (iii)(x) above or if the Borrower rejects any offers made by Lenders

to the Lenders or affected Lenders, as the case may be, and in the case of
a
cancellation, such B Borrowing shall not be made.

Section
2.04  Fees.



(a)  Facility
Fees.
The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a facility
fee on the amount of such Lender's Commitment (or if no Commitment is in effect,
Advances), whether used or unused and without giving effect to any B Reduction,
from the date hereof in the case of each Bank and from the effective date
specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender
in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date of such Lender,
payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December
during the term of such Lender's Commitment, commencing September 30, 2006,
and
on the Termination Date of such Lender, in an amount equal to the















17





















product
of (i) the average daily amount of such Lender's Commitment (whether used or
unused and without giving effect to any B Reduction) in effect during the period
for which such payment that is to be made times (ii) the weighted average rate
per annum that is derived from the following rates: (a) a rate of 0.050% per
annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher of the
Ratings was Level 1, (b) a rate of 0.080% per annum with respect to each day
during such period that the higher of such Ratings was Level 2, (c) a rate
of
0.090% per annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher
of
such Ratings was Level 3, (d) a rate of 0.100% per annum with respect to each
day during such period that the higher of such Ratings was Level 4, (e) a rate
of 0.125% per annum with respect to each day during such period that the higher
of such Ratings was Level 5, or (f) a rate of 0.150% per annum with respect
to
each day during such period that the higher of such Ratings was Level 6. If
any
change in the Rating established by S&P, Moody's or Fitch shall result in a
change in the Level, the change in the facility fee shall be effective as of
the
date on which such rating change is publicly announced by S&P, Moody's or
Fitch, as the case may be. If Ratings are available from only one of S&P,
Moody’s or Fitch, then the applicable Level shall be set by reference to this
one Rating. If Ratings are available from only two of S&P, Moody’s or Fitch
and such Ratings fall within two different Levels, then the higher of such
Ratings shall apply, unless there is a split in such Ratings of more than one
Level, in which case the Level that is one Level higher than the Level of the
lower Rating shall apply. If Ratings are available from each of S&P, Moody's
and Fitch and such Ratings fall within two different Levels, the applicable
Level shall be set by reference to the Ratings established by two of the three
rating agencies. If Ratings are available from each of S&P, Moody's and
Fitch and such Ratings fall within three different Levels, the applicable Level
shall be set by reference to the middle Rating. If Ratings are unavailable
from
S&P, Moody’s and Fitch for any reason for any day, then the applicable Level
for purposes of calculating the facility fee for such day shall be deemed to
be
Level 6. If any of S&P, Moody’s or Fitch change the basis on which their
ratings are established and/or described, each reference in this Agreement
to a
Rating announced by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch, as the case may be, shall be
deemed to refer to the then equivalent rating established by S&P, Moody’s or
Fitch.



(b)  Agents’
Fees.
The
Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent the fees payable pursuant to the fee letter
dated as of July 26, 2006 between the Borrower and CUSA, in the amounts and
at

Reduction of the Commitments.
The
Borrower shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice to
the
Agent by the Borrower, to terminate in whole or permanently reduce ratably
in
part the unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders,
provided
that the
aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced to
an
amount which is less than the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then
outstanding, and provided,
further,
that
each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.



Section
2.06  Repayment
and Prepayment of A Advances.



(a)  Mandatory
Repayment on Termination Date.
The
Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal amount of each A Advance made
by
each Lender to the Borrower on the Termination Date of such Lender.













18


















(b)  Mandatory
Prepayment Due to Reductions of Commitments.
The
Borrower shall from time to time prepay the A Advances made to the Borrower
to
the extent necessary so that the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the
Advances then outstanding does not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Commitments of the Lenders then in effect (computed without regard to any B
Reduction).



(c)  Voluntary
Prepayments of A Borrowings.
The
Borrower shall not have any right to prepay any principal amount of any A
Advances other than as provided in this subsection (c). The Borrower may, upon
at least one Business Day's notice to the Agent in the case of Base Rate
Advances and at least three Business Days' notice to the Agent in the case
of
Eurodollar Rate Advances stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay
the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances made to the Borrower
comprising part of the same A Borrowing in whole or ratably in part;
provided,
however,
that
(x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount not
less than $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof
and
(y) in the case of any such prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Advance, the
Borrower shall pay all accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the
portion of such Eurodollar Rate Advance being prepaid and shall be obligated
to
reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section
8.04(b).



Section
2.07  Interest
on A Advances.
The
Borrower shall pay interest accrued on the principal amount of each A Advance
that was made to the Borrower outstanding from time to time from the date of
such A Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the
following rates per annum:



(a)  Base
Rate Advances.
If such
A Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the
Base Rate in effect from time to time, payable in arrears on the last day of
each March, June, September and December during the term of this Agreement,
commencing September 30, 2006, and on the Termination Date of the applicable
Lender; provided
that any
amount of principal, interest, fees and other amounts payable under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the principal amount of Base Rate
Advances, but excluding the principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances and
B
Advances) which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest from the date on which such
amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate
per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the Base Rate in effect
from
time to time.



(b)  Eurodollar
Rate Advances.
If such
A Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times
during the Interest Period for such A Advance to the sum of the Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin, payable
in
arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period
has
a duration of more than three months, on the day which occurs during such
Interest Period three months from the first day of such Interest Period;
provided
that any
principal amount of any Eurodollar Rate Advance which is not paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest
from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full,
payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to (A) during the
Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Advance, the greater of
(x) 2% per annum above the Base Rate in effect from time to time and
(y) 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such
amount immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due and
















19





















(B) after
the expiration of such Interest Period, 2% per annum above the Base Rate in
effect from time to time.



Section
2.08  Interest
Rate Determination.
The
Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the Lenders of the applicable
interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.07(a) or
2.07(b).



Section
2.09  Voluntary
Conversion or Continuation of A Advances.



(a)  The
Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later
than
12:00 noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date
of
the proposed Conversion or continuance (a “Notice of Conversion/Continuation”)
and subject to the provisions of Section 2.02(b), (1) Convert all
Advances of one Type comprising the same A Borrowing made to the Borrower into
A
Advances of another Type and (2) upon the expiration of any Interest Period
applicable to A Advances which are Eurodollar Rate Advances made to the
Borrower, continue all (or, subject to Section 2.02(b), any portion of)
such A Advances as Eurodollar Rate Advances and the succeeding Interest
Period(s) of such continued A Advances shall commence on the last day of the
Interest Period of the A Advances to be continued; provided,
however,
that
any Conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Advances into A Advances of another Type
shall be made on, and only on, the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Rate Advances. Each such Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall,
within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such
continuation or Conversion, (ii) the A Advances (or, subject to Section
2.02(b), any portion thereof) to be continued or Converted, (iii) if such
continuation is of, or such Conversion is into, Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
duration of the Interest Period for each such A Advance and (iv) that no
Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.



(b)  If
upon
the expiration of the then existing Interest Period applicable to any A Advance
which is a Eurodollar Rate Advance made to the Borrower, the Borrower shall
not
have delivered a Notice of Conversion/Continuation in accordance with this
Section 2.09, then such Advance shall upon such expiration automatically be
Converted to a Base Rate Advance.



(c)  After
the
occurrence of and during the continuance of a Potential Event of Default or
an
Event of Default, the Borrower may not elect to have an A Advance be made or
continued as, or Converted into, a Eurodollar Rate Advance after the expiration
of any Interest Rate then in effect for that A Advance.



Section
2.10  Increased
Costs.



(a)  If,
due
to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by
way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements in the case of Eurodollar
Rate Advances included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in
the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
Eurodollar Rate Advances made to the Borrower, then the Borrower shall from
time
to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent),
pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient
to
compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A















20





















reasonably
detailed certificate as to the amount and manner of calculation of such
increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Lender, shall
be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.



(b)  If
any
Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline
or
request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not
having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required
or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling
such
Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the
existence of such Lender's commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments
of
this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to
the
Agent), the Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of
such
Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such
circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment
to lend hereunder. A reasonably detailed certificate as to such amounts and
the
manner of calculation thereof submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such
Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.



(c)  If
a
Lender shall change its Applicable Lending Office, such Lender shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.10 and 2.12 than
the amount such Lender would have been entitled to receive if it had not changed
its Applicable Lending Office, unless such change was made at the request of
the
Borrower or at a time when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment
did not exist.






Section
2.11  Payments
and Computations.



(a)  The
Borrower shall make each payment hereunder not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York
City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at its address
referred to in Section 8.02 in same day funds, without setoff, deduction or
counterclaim. Subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Agent will
promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment
of principal or interest or facility fees ratably (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.10 or 2.12 or, to the extent the Termination Date
is
not the same for all Lenders, pursuant to Section 2.06(a)) to the Lenders for
the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds
relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender
for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied
in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon receipt of principal or
interest paid after an Event of Default and an acceleration or a deemed
acceleration of amounts due hereunder, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause
to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest
ratably in accordance with each Lender's outstanding A Advances and B Advances
(other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12) to the Lenders
for
the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices. Upon its acceptance
of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information contained
therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the
effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall
make
all payments hereunder in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender
assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall
make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such
effective date directly between themselves.











21


















(b)  All
computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made by the Agent
on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations
of interest based on the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate
and
of facility fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days,
in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or
such
fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.



(c)  Whenever
any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business
Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such
extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment
of interest or facility fee, as the case may be; provided,
however,
if such
extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate
Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall
be
made on the next preceding Business Day.



(d)  Unless
the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on
which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made
such
payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon
such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an
amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent that
the
Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender
shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such
Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount
is
distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to
the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.



Section
2.12  Taxes.



(a)  Any
and
all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made, in accordance with Section
2.11, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto, excluding,
in the
case of each Lender and the Agent, (i) taxes imposed on its income, and
franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
such
Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political
subdivision thereof or in which its principal office is located, (ii) taxes
imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction
of
such Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof,
(iii) taxes imposed upon or measured by the overall net income of such Lender
by
the United States of America or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof or therein, and (iv) United States income taxes (including withholding
taxes with respect to payments hereunder) payable with respect to payments
hereunder under laws (including without limitation any statute, treaty, ruling,
determination or regulation) in effect on the date hereof in the case of each
Bank and on the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to
which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender (all such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being
hereinafter referred to as “Taxes”). If the Borrower shall be required by law to
deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender
or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable
to
additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had
no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall















22





















make
such
deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law.



(b)  In
addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary
taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which
arise from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect
to, this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).



(c)  The
Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes
or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12) and the Borrower
will indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other
Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12), in each case paid
by
such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.
This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender
or
the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.



(d)  Within
30
days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the
Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.



(e)  (i)
Each
Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States,
on
or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the
case
of each Bank and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which
it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time
thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such
Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower with Internal
Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8BCI, as appropriate, or any successor form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, to establish that such Lender is
not
subject to United States withholding tax with respect to any payments to such
Lender of interest payable under this Agreement. If the form provided by a
Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates
a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding
tax
at such rate shall be considered excluded from “Taxes” as defined in Section
2.12(a).















23





















(ii) In
addition, each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act for its own
account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender
under this Agreement (for example, in the case of a typical participation by
such Lender), on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Bank and on the date of the Assignment and
Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other
Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower
(but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide
the Borrower with Internal Revenue Service form W-8BIMY, or any successor form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, to establish that such Lender is
not
acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable
to
such Lender.



(f)  For
any
period (i) during which any Tax is required to be deducted or withheld on the
basis of the information, certificates or statements of exemption a Lender
chooses to transmit with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY pursuant to
subsection 2.12(e)(ii), or (ii) with respect to which a Lender has failed to
provide the Borrower with the appropriate form described in Section 2.12(e)
(other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring subsequent
to
the date on which a form originally was required to be provided, or if such
form
otherwise is not required under the first sentence of subsection 2.12(e)(i)
above), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section
2.12(a) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided,
however,
that
should a Lender become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a
form
required hereunder, the Borrower shall, at the expense of such Lender, take
such
steps as the Lender shall reasonably request to assist the Lender to recover
such Taxes.



(g)  Without
prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder,
the
agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this Section 2.12 shall
survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder.



Section
2.13  Sharing
of Payments, Etc.
If any
Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the A Advances
made by it (other than pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12 or, to the extent the
Termination Date is not the same for all Lenders, pursuant to Section 2.06(a))
in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the A Advances obtained
by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders
such participations in the A Advances made by them as shall be necessary to
cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each
of
them, provided,
however,
that if
all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such
Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent
of
such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender)
of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in
respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender
so
purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully
as
if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.













24


















Section
2.14  Evidence
of Debt.



(a)  Each
Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or
accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting
from each Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower
(with a copy of such notice to the Agent) to the effect that a promissory note
or other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for such
Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise)
the A Advances or the B Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender promissory notes
or
other evidence of such indebtedness, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Borrower and such Lender, payable to the order of such
Lender in a principal amount equal, in the case of the A Advances, to the
aggregate principal amount of the Commitment of such Lender and, in the case
of
the B Advances, to the outstanding principal amount of B Advances of such
Lender; provided,
however,
that
the execution and delivery of such promissory note or other evidence of
indebtedness shall not be a condition precedent to the making of any Advance
under this Agreement.



(b)  The
Register maintained by the Agent pursuant to Section 8.07(c) shall include
a
control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts
(taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date, amount and tenor, as
applicable, of each Borrowing, the Borrower that received the proceeds of such
Borrowing, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to
each
Lender hereunder, and (iv) the amount of any sum received by the Agent from
the Borrower hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.



(c)  The
entries made in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.



Section
2.15  Use
of Proceeds.



(a)  Advances
shall be used by the Borrower for Commercial Paper backup, for Non-Hostile
Acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.



(b)  No
portion of the proceeds of any Advances under this Agreement shall be used
by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner which might cause the
Advances or the application of such proceeds to violate, or require any Lender
to make any filing or take any other action under, Regulation T, Regulation
U or
Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any
other regulation of such Board or to violate the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, in each case as in effect on the date or dates of such Advances and such
use of proceeds.



Section
2.16  Extension
of the Commitment Termination Date.
The
Borrower may, not later than 30 days prior to each applicable anniversary of
the
Effective Date (the “Current Anniversary Date”), and not more than once in any
calendar year, commencing not















25





















later
than 60 days prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date, from time
to
time request that the Commitment Termination Date for all Eligible Lenders
(as
defined below) be extended for a period of one year by delivering to the Agent
a
copy of an extension request signed by the Borrower (an “Extension Request”) in
substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto; provided
that at
the time of such request and as of the date of any such extension of the
Commitment Termination Date, (i) the representations and warranties of the
Borrower contained in Article IV are correct on and as of such date, as though
made on and as of such date, except to the extent that any such representation
or warranty expressly relates only to an earlier date, in which case they were
correct as of such earlier date, and (ii) no Event of Default or Potential
Event
of Default exists and is continuing. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
of its receipt of such Extension Request. On or prior to the fifteenth day
(the
“Determination Date”) prior to the Current Anniversary Date, each Eligible
Lender shall notify the Agent and the Borrower of its willingness or
unwillingness to extend its Commitment Termination Date hereunder. Any Eligible
Lender that shall fail to so notify the Agent and the Borrower on or prior
to
the Determination Date shall be deemed to have declined to so extend. In the
event that, on or prior to the Determination Date, Eligible Lenders representing
more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments of all Eligible Lenders
then in effect shall consent to such extension, the Agent shall so advise the
Lenders and the Borrower and, subject to execution of documentation evidencing
such extension and consents, the Commitment Termination Date of each Eligible
Lender (each a “Consenting Lender”) that has consented on or prior to the
Determination Date to so extend shall be extended to the date indicated in
the
Extension Request. Thereafter, (i) for each Consenting Lender, the term
“Commitment Termination Date” as used herein and in any promissory note executed
and delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof, shall at all
times refer to such date, unless it is later extended pursuant to this Section
2.16, and (ii) for each Lender that is not an Eligible Lender and for each
Eligible Lender that either has declined on or prior to the Determination Date
to so extend or is deemed to have so declined, the term “Commitment Termination
Date” shall at all times refer to the date which was the Commitment Termination
Date of such Lender immediately prior to the delivery to the Agent of such
Extension Request. In the event that, as of the Determination Date, the
Consenting Lenders represent 50% or less of the aggregate amount of the
Commitments of all Eligible Lenders then in effect, the Agent shall so advise
the Lenders and the Borrower, and none of the Lenders' Commitment Termination
Dates shall be extended to the date indicated in the Extension Request and
each
Lender's Commitment Termination Date shall continue to be the date which was
the
Commitment Termination Date of such Lender immediately prior to the delivery
to
the Agent of such Extension Request. For purposes of this Section 2.16, the
term
“Eligible Lenders” means, with respect to any Extension Request, (i) all
Lenders if no Lender's Commitment Termination Date had been extended pursuant
to
this Section 2.16 prior to the delivery to the Agent of such Extension Request,
and (ii) in all other cases, those Lenders which had extended their
Commitment Termination Date in the most recent extension of any Commitment
Termination Date effected pursuant to this Section 2.16.



Section
2.17  Substitution
of Lenders.
If any
Lender requests compensation from the Borrower under Section 2.10(a) or (b)
or
if any Lender declines to extend its Commitment Termination Date pursuant to
Section 2.16, the Borrower shall have the right, with the assistance of the
Agent, to seek one or more substitute banks or financial institutions (which
may
be one or more of the Lenders) reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and the
Borrower to purchase the Advances and assume the Commitments of such Lender,
and
the















26





















Borrower,
the Agent, such Lender, and such substitute banks or financial institutions
shall execute and deliver an appropriately completed Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to Section 8.07(a) hereof to effect the assignment of rights to and
the
assumption of obligations by such substitute banks or financial institutions;
provided
that
such requesting Lender shall be entitled to (i) compensation under Section
2.10
for any costs incurred by it prior to its replacement, (ii) payment of all
A
Advances of such Lender then outstanding and all interest and fees accrued
to
the date of such payment, and (iii) if any Eurodollar Rate Advances of such
Lender are then outstanding, any reimbursement which would be payable under
Section 8.04(b) in connection with a prepayment of such Eurodollar Rate Advances
on such date.



Section
2.18  Increased
Commitments; Additional Lenders.



(a)  No
more
than once per year from the Effective Date, the Borrower may, upon at least
thirty (30) days notice to the Agent (which shall promptly provide a copy of
such notice to the Lenders), propose to increase the aggregate amount of the
Commitments in increments of $25,000,000, the total amount of all such increases
not to exceed $250,000,000 (the amount of any such increase, the “Increased
Commitments”); provided
that at
the time of and after giving effect to any increase in the Commitments (and
the
delivery of the applicable commitment increase notice shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower that on the effective date of such
increase such statements are true) (i) the Borrower’s Long-Term Debt ratings
from two of (1) Moody’s, (2) S&P, and (3) Fitch are better than or equal to
Baa2, BBB or BBB respectively; (ii) the representations and warranties of the
Borrower contained in Article IV are correct on and as of the date of such
increase, before and after giving effect to such increase, as though made on
and
as of such date, except to the extent that any such representation or warranty
expressly relates only to an earlier date, in which case they were correct
as of
such earlier date; (iii) no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default
exists and is continuing; (iv) on the date of such increase, (x) there shall
be
no A Advances outstanding or all Interest Periods shall have ended and (y)
and
all accrued and unpaid interest on the A Advances and all accrued and unpaid
Facility Fees shall have been paid in full and (v) after any such increase,
no
Lender’s Commitment shall exceed 50% of the aggregate amount of the Commitments.
Each Lender party to this Agreement at such time shall have the right (but
no
obligation), for a period of fifteen (15) days following receipt of such notice,
to elect by notice to the Borrower and the Agent to increase its Commitment
by a
principal amount which bears the same ratio to the Increased Commitments as
its
then Commitment bears to the aggregate Commitments then existing.



(b)  If
any
Lender party to this Agreement shall not elect to increase its Commitment
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, the Borrower may designate
another lender or other lenders (which may be, but need not be, one or more
of
the existing Lenders) which at the time agree to (i) in the case of any
such lender that is an existing Lender, increase its Commitment and (ii) in
the case of any other such lender (an “Additional Lender”), become a party to
this Agreement. The sum of the increases in the Commitments of the existing
Lenders pursuant to this subsection (b) plus the Commitments of the
Additional Lenders shall not in the aggregate exceed the unsubscribed amount
of
the Increased Commitments.



(c)  An
increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this Section
2.18 shall become effective upon the receipt by the Agent of an agreement in
form and substance satisfactory to the Agent signed by the Borrower, by each
Additional Lender and by each other Lender whose Commitment is to be increased,
setting forth the new Commitments of















27





















such
Lenders and Additional Lenders on a revised Schedule II to this Agreement and
setting forth the agreement of each Additional Lender to become a party to
this
Agreement and to be bound by all the terms and provisions hereof, together
with
such evidence of appropriate corporate authorization on the part of the Borrower
with respect to the Increased Commitments and such opinions of counsel for
the
Borrower with respect to the Increased Commitments as the Agent may reasonably
request.



Section
2.19  Special
Purpose Funding Vehicles.



Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender, (a “Granting
Lender”)
may
grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPC”)
the
option to fund all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would
otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
that
(i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by an SPC to fund any Advance,
and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to
fund
all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to
fund
such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof. The funding of an Advance by an
SPC
hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same
extent, and as if, such Advance were funded by such Granting Lender. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or payment
under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long
as, and to the extent, the Granting Lender provides such indemnity or makes
such
payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
any SPC may disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating
to its funding of Advances to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or
provider of any surety or guarantee to such SPC.

Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the
Advances and other amounts owing hereunder), the Agent shall not be required
to
exercise any discretion or















40





















take
any
action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions
of
the Majority Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders;
provided,
however,
that
the Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Agent
to
personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law.
The
Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it
by
the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Lenders identified
on

or
be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender.

Reliance, Etc.
Neither
the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in
connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence
or
willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing,
the
Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Advance as the holder thereof until
the Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by
the
Lender which is the payee of such Advance, as assignor, and an Eligible
Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 8.07; (ii) may consult with
legal counsel (including counsel for the Borrower), independent public

covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the Borrower or to
inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower;
(v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement
or
any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall

notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by
telecopier, telegram, or delivery) believed by it to be genuine and signed
or
sent by the proper party or parties.



Section
7.03  CUSA
and Affiliates.
With
respect to its Commitment, the Advances made by it, CUSA shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise
the

unless otherwise expressly indicated, include CUSA in its individual capacity.
CUSA and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee
under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the
Borrower, any of their respective subsidiaries and any Person who may do
business with or own securities of the Borrower or any such subsidiary, all
as
if CUSA were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.



Section
7.04  Lender
Credit Decision.
Each
Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to
in
Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance















41





















upon
the
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement.



Section
7.05  Indemnification.
The
Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the
Borrower), ratably according to the respective principal amounts of the A
Advances then held by each of them (or if no A Advances are at the time
outstanding or if any A Advances are held by Persons which are not Lenders,
ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitments), from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against
the
Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action
taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement, provided
that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly
upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including
counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, syndication, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise)
of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement,
to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the
Borrower.



Section
7.06  Successor
Agent.
The
Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders
and
the Borrower and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the
Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the
retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which
shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of
America or of any State thereof or any Bank and, in each case having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it
while it was Agent under this Agreement.

the
Borrower is made other than on the last day of the interest period for such
Advance, as a result of a payment pursuant to Section 2.06 or acceleration
of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any other
reason, the Borrower shall, upon demand by any Lender (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender any
amounts required to compensate such Lender for any additional losses, costs
or
expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment, including,
without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender
to
fund or maintain such Advance.



(c)  The
Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, each Lender and each
director, officer, employee, agent, attorney and affiliate of the Agent and
each
Lender (each an “indemnified person”) in connection with any expenses, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities to which the Agent, a Lender or such indemnified
persons may become subject, insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages
or
liabilities (or actions or other proceedings commenced or threatened in respect
thereof) arise out of the transactions referred to in this Agreement or arise
from any use or intended use of the proceeds of the Advances, or in any way
arise out of activities of the Borrower that violate Environmental Laws, and

(whether or not the Agent, such Lender or any such person is a party to any
action or proceeding out of which any such expense arises). Notwithstanding
the
foregoing, the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to an indemnified
person with respect to indemnified liabilities which have resulted from the
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such indemnified
person.



(d)  To
the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert,
and
hereby waives, any claim against any indemnified person, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed

of this Agreement, or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
transactions contemplated hereby, any Advance or the use of the proceeds
thereof.

owing by such Lender or any Affiliate thereof to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement that are then due and payable,
whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement,
and
each such Affiliate is hereby irrevocably authorized to permit such setoff
and
application. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such
set-off and application made by such Lender, provided
that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) which such Lender may have.



Section
8.06  Binding

(i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than any
B
Advances), (ii) after giving effect to any such assignment, (1) the assigning
Lender shall no longer have any Commitment or (2) the amount of the Commitment

and increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (iii) each such assignment
shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and (iv) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and

extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party

any portion of its rights hereunder to an Affiliate of such Lender















46

to
another Lender or (ii) without notice to or consent of the Borrower, pledge
as
security all or any portion of its rights hereunder to any Federal Reserve

the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements,
warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement
or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency
or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Borrower or the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy
of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred
to
in Section 4.01, and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender
and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible
Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers

will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by
the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a
Lender.

the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of,
the
Commitment Termination Date of, and, with respect to the Borrower, principal
amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the “Register”).
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for
all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection
by
the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.



(d)  Within
five days of its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee
(together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 with respect thereto)
and upon consent of the Agent and, so long as no Potential Event of Default
or
Event of Default then exists and is continuing (and except for assignments
to an
Affiliate of the Lender or to another Lender), the Borrower thereto, which
consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Agent shall, if
such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form
of
Exhibit B hereto, (1) accept such Assignment and Acceptance and (2) record
the information contained therein in the Register. All communications with
the
Borrower with respect to such consent of

participation under which the participant shall have rights to require such
Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder or approve any amendment
to
or waiver of this Agreement, except to the extent such amendment or waiver
would: (A) extend the Termination Date of such Lender; or (B) reduce the
interest rate or the amount of principal or fees applicable to Advances or
the
Commitment in which such participant is participating.



(g)  Any
Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed
assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 8.07, disclose to the
assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information
relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the
Borrower; provided

WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, Borrowers and SCPIE Underwriting
Limited, a limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales, are borrowers under an agreement dated June 28, 2005, entitled Amendment and Restatement Agreement Relating to a Facility Letter dated 15 November 2001 and an
Insurance Letters of Credit Agreement dated 15 November 2001 (“Barclays Credit Agreement”) with Barclays Bank PLC, a bank organized under the laws of England (“Barclays”);
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Barclays Credit Agreement, Barclays has issued for the account of one or more Borrowers, those certain letters of credit described in Schedule A
hereto (each an “Existing LOC,” and, collectively, “Existing LOCs”);
WHEREAS, Borrowers have requested that Lender extend credit to
Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement and to issue replacement standby letters of credit to the beneficiaries of the Existing LOCs and to provide other standby letters of credit in support of Borrowers’ reinsurance programs and other obligations
in the Ordinary Course of Business, all in substitution of the letter of credit facility extended by Barclays under the Barclays Credit Agreement and upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1—LETTERS OF CREDIT
1.1
Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and provided no Default or Event of Default shall occur and be continuing beyond any applicable cure period under this Agreement, upon the application of one or more
Borrowers, Lender shall issue nontransferable irrevocable standby letters of credit (each, a “Letter of Credit”) for the account of Borrowers and for the purposes herein described, at any time and from time to time on or before the Last
Issuance Date. Borrowers shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, to immediately reimburse Lender for any and all amounts paid by Lender under any Letter of Credit,
including, without limitations all fees, costs, expenses and reimbursements incurred or paid by Lender in connection with any Letter of Credit.


1








(a) The term of each Letter of Credit shall initially be one (1) year from its date of issuance and
shall be automatically renewed for successive one (1) year periods or until the Business Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, whichever first occurs.
(b) Each Borrower applying for a Letter of Credit hereunder shall give Lender at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice specifying the date on which a Letter of Credit is to be issued and
identifying the beneficiary thereof. The aforementioned notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the requested Letter of Credit to be issued, which must be in a form reasonably acceptable to Lender, and by such Borrower’s application for the
Letter of Credit in Lender’s standard form and setting forth the specific terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit in form and content reasonably acceptable to Lender.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) All Letters of Credit
must be issued to and for the benefit of Persons (other than a Borrower or any Affiliate of a Borrower) in support of a Borrower’s obligations in the Ordinary Course of Business.
(e) Lender shall have no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit which would cause the Total Letter of Credit Liability immediately after the issuance
of such Letter of Credit to exceed the Maximum Letter of Credit Liability.
(f) If the Total Letter of Credit Liability at any time exceeds
the Maximum Letter of Credit Liability (the amount of such excess is herein referred to as the “Excess Liability”), then upon ten (10) days’ written notice from Lender to the Borrower for whose account the Letter of Credit has
been issued and which Letter of Credit has caused the Excess Liability, Parent or such Borrower shall either (i) deposit to its Treasury Fund Money Market Account additional cash Collateral in an amount not less than such Excess Liability, or
(ii) deliver and deposit to its Treasury Securities Account additional Pledged Securities having a Net Current Value of not less than such Excess Liability, or (iii) deposit to its Treasury Fund Money Market Account and Treasury Securities
Account any combination of cash Collateral and additional Pledged Securities having a total Current Value and Net Current Value, as applicable, of not less than the full amount of such Excess Liability. The failure to deposit and deliver such cash
Collateral or additional Pledged Securities in full on or prior to the expiration of said ten (10) day period shall be an immediate Event of Default.
1.2 Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower for whose account a Letter of Credit has been issued or Parent shall pay to Lender fees for each such Letter of Credit (each, a “Letter of Credit Fee”), in
advance, for the period from and including the Issuance Date to and excluding the date of expiration or termination, computed at the rate of 0.60% per annum on the face amount of the Letter of Credit, plus the standard issuance fees then
customarily charged by Lender (Schedule 1.2 contains a current schedule of such fees); provided, however, at Lender’s option, while an Event of Default exists each such Letter of Credit Fee shall be increased by an additional two
percentage points (2.0%). The Letter of Credit Fee for each Letter of Credit shall be due and payable quarterly, in advance, due on the Issuance Date and on the first day of each three-month period during the term of such Letter of Credit.



2








All computations of fees and interest payable under this Agreement shall be made on the basis of a three hundred and
sixty (360) day year and actual days elapsed.
1.3 Payments by Borrowers.
(a) All payments to be made by Borrowers, including all reimbursement obligations, Letter of Credit Fees, and other amounts required hereunder and in any
application for a Letter of Credit shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America, without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim, shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made to Lender at Lender’s Payment Office
hereto and shall be made in dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Pacific time) on the date specified for payment.
(b) If any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.
(c) If any required payment is not made within ten (10) days after the same becomes due and payable, Lender, in addition to its other remedies, may collect, and the Borrower that has failed to make a required
payment or Parent shall pay on demand, a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the amount overdue. The right to receive and collect a late payment charge is in addition to all other rights and remedies of Lender upon non-performance by
Borrowers of the Obligations.
1.4 Net Payments. Any and all payments by Borrowers to Lender under this Agreement shall be made free
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of Lender, such taxes (including
income taxes or franchise taxes) as are imposed on or measured by Lender’s net income or net capital (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as
“Taxes”). In addition, Borrowers shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”). Borrowers shall indemnify and hold Lender harmless for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date Lender makes written
demand therefor.
1.5 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return. If Lender shall have determined that:
(a) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation;
(b) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation;


3








(c) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central
bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof; or
(d) compliance by Lender, or any
corporation controlling Lender, with any Capital Adequacy Regulation;
affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by Lender or any
corporation controlling Lender and (taking into consideration Lender’s or such corporation’s policies with respect to capital adequacy and Lender’s desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as
a consequence of the Commitment or the Total Letter of Credit Liability, or other Obligations under this Agreement, then, within thirty (30) days of demand of Lender, Borrowers for whose accounts one or more Letters of Credit have been issued
shall pay to Lender on a pro rata basis, and from time to time as specified by Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate Lender for such increase.
1.6 Survival. The agreements and obligations of Borrowers in Sections 1.4 and 1.5 shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.
1.7 Several Obligations. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Obligations of Borrowers are and shall be several
Obligations of each of them. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein: (i) any reference to Borrower or Borrowers herein shall mean only the specific Borrower for whose account Lender has issued or will issue one or more
Letters of Credit and Parent, and the Obligations of a Borrower (other than Parent) shall be limited to only those Obligations arising out of the Letters of Credit issued by Lender for such Borrower’s account.
(a) Parent is accepting joint and several liability under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the financial
accommodations to be provided by Lender under this Agreement, which Parent hereby agrees are for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of Parent and each Borrower for whose account Lender has issued or will issue one or more Letters of Credit
and in consideration of the undertakings of the other Borrowers under this Agreement. Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not as a surety but as a co-obligor, joint and several liability with each Borrower for whose account Lender
has issued or will issue one or more Letters of Credit, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including, without limitation, any Obligations arising under this Section). If and to the extent that any of Borrowers
shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event Parent will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such
Obligation.
(b) The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section constitute the absolute and unconditional, full
recourse Obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other circumstances whatsoever.



4








(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Borrower hereby waives notice of any
Letters of Credit issued under or pursuant to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default, Event of Default, or of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by Lender under or in
respect of any of the Obligations, any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and, generally, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement).
(d) Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement
of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by Lender at any time or times in
respect of any default by such Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by Lender in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking,
addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of such Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of Lender with respect to the failure by such Borrower to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure
strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this Section afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving such
Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Agreement, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of such Person shall not be discharged
except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance.
(e) The Obligations of each Borrower shall not be diminished or
rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, insolvency, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any such Borrower or Lender. The joint and several liability of Parent hereunder shall continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other change whatsoever in the name, constitution or place of formation of any of the Borrowers or Lender.
(f) Each Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that such Borrower is currently informed of the financial condition of Borrowers and of all other
circumstances which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations. Each Borrower further represents and warrants to Lender that such Borrower has read and understands the terms and conditions of the
Loan Documents. Each Borrower hereby covenants that such Borrower will continue to keep informed of the financial condition of all other Borrowers and of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the
Obligations.
(g) Each Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Lender, even though that election
of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure or other disposition with respect to Collateral for the Obligations, has destroyed Lender’s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against one or more Borrowers by operation of law or otherwise.



5








(h) The provisions of this Section are made for the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns, and
may be enforced by it from time to time against Parent as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Lender, successor, or assign first to marshal any of its claims or to exercise any of its rights against any of the
other Borrowers or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any of the other Borrowers or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of
this Section shall remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored or returned by Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any of the Borrowers, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made.

(i) Parent hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against the other Borrowers with respect to any
liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to Lender with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in
full in cash. Any claim which Parent may have against any other Borrower with respect to any payments to Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as
to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under
the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or
other property, shall be made to Parent therefor.
(j) Each Borrower hereby agrees that, after the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Default or Event of Default, the payment of any amounts due with respect to the indebtedness owing by any Borrower to any other Borrower is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations. Each Borrower hereby agrees
that after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, such Borrower will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any indebtedness of any other Borrower owing to such Borrower until the Obligations shall
have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, such Borrower shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by such Borrower as
trustee for Lender, and such Borrower shall deliver any such amounts to Lender for application to the Obligations.

exemption, authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority (except for recordings or filings in connection with the Liens granted to Lender for the benefit of Lender under the Collateral Documents) is
necessary or required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by, or enforcement against, Borrowers of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, where the failure to obtain such approval, consent, exemption, authorization or other

Lender’s Liens on the Collateral. No Borrower is in default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation in any respect which, individually or together with all such defaults, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse

11

Parent and each ERISA Affiliate are in compliance with all requirements of each Plan, and each Plan complies with and is operated in compliance with all applicable provisions of law in all respects, except in each case for such noncompliance which
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.7, each Qualified Plan has been determined by the IRS to qualify under the Code and each related trust has been determined by the IRS to be exempt
from tax under the Code. To the knowledge of Borrowers, nothing has occurred which would cause the loss of such qualification or tax-exempt status. All required contributions have been made in accordance with the provisions of each Plan, and with

Section 406 of ERISA.

other nationally recognized rating agency.
(c) Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 3.7, no member of the Controlled Group has
ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any current or former employee (either individually or to employees as a group) that such current or former employee(s) would be provided, at any cost to any member of the
Controlled Group, with any material amount of life insurance or employee welfare plan benefits (within the meaning of section 3(l) of ERISA) following retirement or termination of employment.
(d) Members of the Controlled Group have complied in all material respects with the notice and continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B
of the Code. No member of the Controlled Group has engaged, directly or indirectly, in a non-exempt prohibited transaction (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) in connection with any Plan which could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
3.8 Use of Letters of Credit; Margin Regulations. The Letters of Credit are intended

3.9 Title to Properties. Borrowers have good and marketable title to or the right to use to all Property necessary or used in the
Ordinary Course of Business, except for defects which could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


12

all material Federal and other tax returns and reports required to be filed, and has paid all material Federal and other taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges levied or imposed upon them or their Properties, income or assets
otherwise due and payable, except those which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP, and no Notice of Lien with respect to any such taxes has been

consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the three (3) months then ended:

in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the respective periods covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly noted therein, subject to, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, normal year-end adjustments and the
lack of footnote disclosures; and
(B) present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of Borrowers as of the

As of the Closing Date, Borrowers do not have, and will not have, any material
Indebtedness or other liabilities, which are not reflected on the March 31, 2007, unaudited consolidated financial statements of Borrowers or disclosed in the Schedules to this Agreement, other than liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course
of Business since March 31, 2007 and other than Obligations to Lender incurred on the Closing Date.
(b) Since March 31, 2007,
there has been no Material Adverse Effect with respect to any of the Borrowers.
(c) All projections that have been delivered to Lender in
connection with its due diligence review of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been prepared in light of the past operations of the businesses of Borrowers and are based upon the estimates and assumptions stated therein, all of
which Borrowers believe, as of the Closing Date, to be reasonable as of the time made and fair in light of conditions and facts known to Borrowers as of the Closing Date. Lender agrees that such projections as to future events are not to be viewed
as facts and were reasonably based upon assumptions with respect to industry performances, general business, economic and competitive conditions and uncertainties, taxes and other matters beyond the control of Borrowers, such that there can be no
assurance that such projections will be realized by Borrowers.

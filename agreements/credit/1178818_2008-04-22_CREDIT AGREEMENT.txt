Lender or an Approved Fund of such Lender without (A) providing any notice to
Agent or any other Person or (B) delivering an executed Assignment and
Acceptance to Agent (each a “Related Party Assignment”), (2) Borrower and Agent

Assignment and Acceptance has been delivered to Agent and the assigning Lender
or Assignee has paid to Agent for Agent’s separate account a processing fee in

such assigning Lender to deliver an Assignment and Acceptance to Agent or any
other Person shall not affect the legality, validity or binding effect of such
assignment, and (4) an Assignment and Acceptance between an assigning Lender and
its Affiliate or Related Fund shall be effective as of the date specified in
such Assignment and Acceptance and recorded on the Related Party Register (as
defined below).”



k. Section 13.1(a) of

replacing it with the following:



“So long
as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any proposed

shall be subject to the consent of Borrower, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.”



l. Section 13.1(b) of
the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by (i) deleting the word “From” appearing
at the beginning thereof and replacing it with the following text “Except as
otherwise provided in the proviso in Section 13.1(a), from”, and (ii) deleting

follows:



“(d)  Immediately
upon Agent's receipt of any required processing fee payment (if required) and

amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition
of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising
therefrom.  The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce
such Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto.”



n. Section 13.1(e) of
the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by (i) deleting the first occurrence of

other provision in this Agreement notwithstanding, any Lender may at any time

and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in
accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Bank or U.S. Treasury
Regulation 31 CFR § 203.24 or any other Person, including, without limitation,
as provided in Section 2.17, and such Person may enforce such pledge or security
interest in any manner permitted under applicable law; provided, that no such
pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or secured party (or any
transferee thereof) for such Lender as a party hereto unless such pledgee or
secured party (or transferee) becomes a Lender hereunder.




(h)           Agent
shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower,
maintain, or cause to be maintained, a register (the "Register") on which it
shall enter the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and
the principal amount of the Advances and the Term Loan (and stated interest
thereon) and Obligations with respect to Letters of Credit owing to, each Lender
from time to time.  Subject to the last sentence of this Section
13.1(h), the entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error, and Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for
inspection by Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable notice.  In the case of a Related Party Assignment pursuant
to the proviso in Section 13.1(a) as to which an Assignment and Acceptance is
not delivered to Agent, the assigning Lender shall, acting solely for this
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a register (the "Related
Party Register") comparable to the Register on behalf of
Borrower.  The Related Party Register shall be available for
inspection by Borrower at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable notice.



(i)           A
Registered Loan (and the Registered Note, if any, evidencing the same) may be
assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or
sale on the Register or the Related Party Register (and each Registered Note
shall expressly so provide).  Any assignment or sale of all or part of
such Registered Loan (and the Registered Note, if any, evidencing the same) may
be effected only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register or
the Related Party Register, together with the surrender of the Registered Note,
if any, evidencing the same duly endorsed by (or accompanied by a written
instrument of assignment or sale duly executed by) the holder of such Registered
Note, whereupon, at the request of the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s),
one or more new Registered Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be
issued to the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s) and such requestor shall
surrender to Borrower the Registered Note being replaced.  Prior to
the registration of assignment or sale of any Registered Loan (and the
Registered Note, if any evidencing the same), Agent and Borrower shall treat the
Person in whose name such Registered Loan (and the Registered Note, if any,
evidencing the same) is registered as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving all payments thereon, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary.




(j)           In
the event that a Lender sells participations in the Registered Loan, such Lender
shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower,
maintain a register on which it enters the name of all participants in the
Registered Loans held by it and the principal amount (and stated interest
thereon) of the portion of the Registered Loan that is the subject of the
participation (the "Participant Register").  A Registered Loan (and
the Registered Note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole
or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant
Register (and each Registered Note shall expressly so provide).  Any
participation of such Registered Loan (and the Registered Note, if any,
evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such
participation on the Participant Register.  The Participant Register
shall be available for inspection by Administrative Borrower at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable notice.”

Loan Amount”, or change Section 2.1(b), Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.1(e)(iii),
or”



q. Section 16(a) of the
Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the following text appearing
therein “; provided, however, that no such Loan Party shall be required to
increase any such amounts if the increase in such amount payable results from
Agent’s or such Lender’s own willful misconduct or gross negligence (as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction)”.



























r. Sections 16(b), 16(c), 16(d), 16(e) and 16(f) of the Credit
Agreement are amended and restated in their entirety as follows:



“(b) If a
Lender claims an exemption from United States withholding tax, such Lender shall
deliver to Agent (or, in the case of a Related Party Assignment that is made
pursuant to the proviso in Section 13.1(a), the
assigning Lender):




(i)           if
such Lender claims an exemption from United States withholding tax pursuant to
its portfolio interest exception, (A) a statement of the Lender, signed under
penalty of perjury, that it is not a (I) a "bank" as described in Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the IRC, (II) a 10% shareholder of any Borrower (within the
meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the IRC), or (III) a controlled foreign
corporation related to any Borrower within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of
the IRC, and (B) a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN, before
receiving its first payment under this Agreement and at any other time
reasonably requested by Agent or the assigning Lender, as
applicable;




(ii) if
such Lender claims an exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding tax under a
United States tax treaty, properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN before
receiving its first payment under this Agreement and at any other time
reasonably requested in writing by Agent or the assigning Lender, as
applicable;




(iii) if
such Lender claims that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United
States withholding tax because it is effectively connected with a United States
trade or business of such Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of
IRS Form W-8ECI before receiving its first payment under this Agreement and at
any other time reasonably requested in writing by Agent or the assigning Lender,
as applicable; or




(iv) such
other form or forms, including IRS Form W-9, as may be required under the IRC or
other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or reduction
of, United States withholding or backup withholding tax before receiving its
first payment under this Agreement and at any other time reasonably requested in
writing by Agent or the assigning Lender, as applicable.




Notwithstanding
the foregoing, such Lender may provide a form W-8IMY, where applicable, with
appropriate forms attached thereto.




Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify Agent or the assigning Lender, as applicable,
of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 16, no
Lender shall be required to deliver any form that such Lender is not legally
able to deliver.




(c)  If
a Lender claims an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax in a
jurisdiction other than the United States, such Lender shall deliver to Agent
(or, in the case of a Related Party Assignment that is made pursuant to the
proviso in Section 13.1(a), the assigning Lender) any such form or forms, as may
be required under the laws of such jurisdiction as a condition to exemption
from, or reduction of, foreign withholding or backup withholding tax before
receiving its first payment under this Agreement and at any other time
reasonably requested in writing by Agent or the assigning Lender, as
applicable.




Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify Agent or the assigning Lender, as applicable,
of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction.




(d)  If
any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax and such
Lender sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of
Borrower to such Lender (other than in the case of a transfer to an Affiliate or
Approved Fund), such Lender agrees to notify Agent (or, in the case
of  a Related Party Assignment that is made pursuant to the proviso in
Section
13.1(a), the assigning Lender) of the percentage amount in which it is no
longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrower.  To the extent
of such percentage amount, Agent and Borrower will treat such Lender's
documentation provided pursuant to Sections 16(b) or
16(c) as no
longer valid.  With respect to such percentage amount, the Assignee of
such Lender may provide new documentation, pursuant to Sections 16(b) or
16(c), if
applicable.




(e)           If
any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable withholding tax, Agent
may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to
the applicable withholding tax after taking into account such
reduction.  If the forms or other documentation required by subsection
(b) or (c) of this Section 16 are not
delivered in accordance with such subsections, then Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other documentation
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.




(f)           If
the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other
jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent did not properly withhold tax from
amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender due to a failure on the part of
the Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly
executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the proper Person of a change
in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax ineffective) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless for all
amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent, as tax or otherwise, including
penalties and interest, and including any Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to Agent under this Section
16.  The obligation of the Lenders under this subsection shall
survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of
Agent.



3. Amendment
Fee.  Borrower hereby agrees to pay to (i) Agent a fee in the
amount of $15,000 (for the account of the Agent), (ii) the Existing Term Loan
Lender a fee in the amount of $100,000 (for the account of the Existing Term
Loan Lender) and (iii) the Term Loan Lender funding the New Term Loan (the
“New Term Loan
Lender”) a fee in the amount of $100,000 (for the account of the New Term
Loan Lender), each such fee shall be due and payable in full on the First
Amendment Effective Date.

the effectiveness of this Agreement, the representations and warranties made by
Borrower contained in the Loan Documents are true and correct in all material

representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all

jurisdiction of its organization and qualified to do business in any state where

f. assuming
the effectiveness of this Agreement, no Default or Event of Default

the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, the failure to
satisfy the requirements of this Section 6 within the period specified herein
shall constitute an Event of Default.



























7. Agreement in Full Force and
Effect as Amended.  Except as specifically amended and/or
waived hereby, the Credit Agreement and other Loan Documents shall remain in
full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed as so
amended.  Except as expressly set forth herein, this Amendment shall
not be deemed to be a waiver, amendment or modification of any provisions of the
Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or any right, power or remedy of the
Lender, nor constitute a waiver of any provision of the Credit Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or any other document, instrument and/or agreement executed
or delivered in connection therewith or of any Default or Event of Default under
any of the foregoing, in each case, whether arising before or after the date
hereof or as a result of performance hereunder or thereunder.  This
Amendment also shall not preclude the future exercise of any right, remedy,
power, or privilege available to the Lender whether under the Credit Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, at law or otherwise and nothing contained herein shall
constitute a course of conduct or dealing among the parties
hereto.  All references to the Credit Agreement shall be deemed to
mean the Credit Agreement as modified hereby.  This Amendment shall
not constitute a novation or satisfaction and accord of the Credit Agreement
and/or other Loan Documents, but shall constitute an amendment
thereof.  The parties hereto agree to be bound by the terms and
conditions of the Credit Agreement and Loan Documents as amended by this
Amendment, as though such terms and conditions were set forth
herein.  Each reference in the Credit Agreement to “this Agreement,”
“hereunder,” “hereof,” “herein” or words of similar import shall mean and be a
reference to the Credit Agreement as amended by this Amendment, and each
reference herein or in any other Loan Document to the “Loan Agreement” or
“Agreement” shall mean and be a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended and
modified by this Amendment.



8. Counterparts.  This
Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement and
any number of separate counterparts, each of which when so executed, shall be
deemed an original and all said counterparts when taken together shall be deemed
to constitute but one and the same instrument.



9. Successors and
Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of Borrower and its successors and assigns and Agent and Lenders and
their successors and assigns.



10. Further
Assurance.  Borrower hereby agrees from time to time, as and
when requested by Agent or any Lender, to execute and deliver or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments and agreements and to
take or cause to be taken such further or other action as Agent or such Lender
may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to carry out the intent and
purposes of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement and the Loan
Documents.



11. GOVERNING
LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND SHALL BE
CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.



12. Severability.  Wherever
possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner
as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this
Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision shall
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.



13. Reaffirmation.
Borrower and each Guarantor, as debtor, grantor, pledgor, guarantor, assignor,
or in any other similar capacity in which Borrower or such Guarantor, as
applicable, grants liens or security interests in its property or otherwise acts
as accommodation party or guarantor, as the case may be, hereby (i) ratifies and
reaffirms all of its payment and performance obligations, contingent or
otherwise, under each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party (after giving
effect hereto) and (ii) to the extent Borrower or Guarantor granted liens on or
security interests in any of its property pursuant to any such Loan Document as
security for or otherwise guaranteed Borrower’s Obligations under or with
respect to the Loan Documents, ratifies and reaffirms such guarantee and grant
of security interests and liens and confirms and agrees that such security
interests and liens hereafter secure all of the Obligations as amended
hereby.  Borrower and each Guarantor hereby consent to this Agreement
and acknowledge that each of the Loan Documents remains in full force and effect
and is hereby ratified and reaffirmed.  The execution of this
Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of Agent
or Lenders, constitute a waiver of any provision of any of the Loan Documents or
serve to effect a novation of the Obligations.



14. Release. Borrower and
each Guarantor hereby remises, releases, acquits, satisfies and forever
discharges the Lenders and Agent, their agents, employees, officers, directors,
predecessors, attorneys and all others acting or purporting to act on behalf of
or at the direction of the Lenders and Agent (“Releasees”), of and
from any and all manner of known actions, causes of action, suit, debts,
accounts, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements, variances, damages,
judgments, claims and demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, whether known or
unknown, which any of such parties ever had, now has or, to the extent arising
from or in connection with any act, omission or state of facts taken or existing
on or prior to the date hereof, may have after the date hereof against the
Releasees, for, upon or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever
through the date hereof arising out of, founded upon, or relating (in any
manner) to the Credit Agreement, the Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated or otherwise evidenced thereby.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Borrower waives and affirmatively agrees not to
allege or otherwise pursue, to the extent known, any defenses, affirmative
defenses, counterclaims, claims, causes of action, setoffs or other rights they
do, shall or may have as of the date hereof, including, but not limited to, the
rights to contest any conduct of the Lenders and Agent or other Releasees on or
prior to the date hereof.  As to each and every claim released
hereunder, each Obligor hereby represents that it has received the advice of
legal counsel with regard to the releases contained herein, and having been so
advised, each of them specifically waives the benefit of the provisions of any
applicable federal or state law (including without limitation the laws of the
state of New York), if any, pertaining to general releases which restricts the
effect of any such waiver with respect to causes of action or other claims that
the party does not know or suspect to exist at the time when the release is
executed.

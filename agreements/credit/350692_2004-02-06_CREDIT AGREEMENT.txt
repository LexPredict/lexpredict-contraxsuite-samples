2.                LOANS

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Other Agreements, absent the existence of a Default:

(a)               Revolving and Term Loan.

LaSalle shall make such revolving loans and advances as part
of the revolving facilities hereunder (the "REVOLVING LOANS") in whatever Type,
and a term loan and advance under the Term Loan Facility (the "TERM LOAN") to or
for the account of the Borrower as the Borrower shall from time to time request,
in accordance with the terms hereof. Subject to the provisions hereof requiring
earlier repayment, all Revolving Loans and the Term Loan shall be repaid in full
upon the earlier to occur of (i) the end of the term of this Agreement and (ii)
their acceleration pursuant to SECTION 14 of this Agreement. If at any time the
outstanding aggregate principal balance of the Revolving Loans and the Term Loan
made to the Borrower exceeds any limit expressed herein (whether or not such
excess results from any change in exchange rates between U.S. Dollars and
Canadian Dollars), the Borrower shall immediately, and without the necessity of
a demand by LaSalle, pay to LaSalle (or cause to be paid to LaSalle) such amount
as may be necessary to eliminate such excess, and LaSalle shall apply any such
payment to it against the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans
and the Term Loan as it may determine in its sole discretion. In particular, if
at any time the outstanding principal balance of the Loans, expressed as the
Canadian Dollar Equivalent Amount thereof, exceeds the Aggregate Commitment or
the amount of Revolving Loans, expressed as the Canadian Dollar Equivalent
Amount thereof, exceeds the amount of the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall
immediately pay to LaSalle such amount as may be necessary to eliminate such
excess, and LaSalle shall apply such payment in such order as LaSalle shall
determine in its sole discretion. The Borrower hereby authorizes LaSalle to
charge any of the Borrower's accounts to make any payments, whether of
principal, interest or otherwise, required by this Agreement.

(b)               Margin and Other Requirements: Revolving Loans.

LaSalle shall make Revolving Loans to the Borrower in U.S.
Dollars by way of U.S. Base Rate Loans and/or LIBO Rate Loans and/or in Canadian
Dollars by way of BA Equivalent Loans and/or Prime Rate Loans. The Canadian
Dollar Equivalent Amount of all such Revolving Loans outstanding at any time
shall not exceed the lesser of the following:

(i)      the sum of the following amounts at such time
expressed as the Canadian Dollar Equivalent Amount
thereof:

A.       an amount in LaSalle's discretion up to
eighty-five percent (85%) of the value of
Eligible Inventory, calculated on the basis
of the net recovery value as determined by
an appraiser acceptable to LaSalle; minus

B.       such reserve amount(s) as LaSalle elects to
establish from time to time in the exercise
of its sole discretion including, without
limitation, reserves for potential
preferential creditor items

<PAGE>

15.

(including, without limitation, if needed in
LaSalle's sole discretion, amounts in
respect of suppliers' repossession rights
pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency
Act (Canada) or similar suppliers' rights in
Quebec pursuant to the Quebec Civil Code,
and amounts in respect of payments that may
become owing to landlords that have not
entered into an agreement with LaSalle
satisfactory to LaSalle); and

(ii)     the Revolving Credit Commitment.

(c)               Margin and Other Requirements: Term Loan.

LaSalle shall make a Term Loan to the Borrower as set out
below in U.S. Dollars by way of U.S. Base Rate Loan and/or LIBO Rate Loan. The
amount of such Term Loan outstanding at any time shall not exceed the following
amounts at such time under a facility (the "TERM LOAN FACILITY") of the lesser
of (x) One Million Forty-Two Thousand U.S. Dollars (U.S.$ 1,042,000) and (y) an
amount in LaSalle's discretion up to eighty percent (80%) of the Net Orderly
Liquidation Value of Eligible Equipment.

There shall be only one advance under the Term Loan Facility,
which shall be fully advanced on the Closing Date and there shall be no right to
further Term Loans thereafter under such facility. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Borrower may draw a Term Loan that is a LIBO Rate Loan to replace
a Term Loan that is a U.S. Base Rate Loan and draw a Term Loan that is a U.S.
Base Rate Loan to replace a Term Loan that is a LIBO Rate Loan.

(d)               Loan Accounts.

(i)      The accounts or records maintained by LaSalle shall
be conclusive evidence, absent manifest error, of the
amount of the Loans made by LaSalle to the Borrower,
and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure so
to record or any error in doing so shall not,
however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of
the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with
respect to the Loans.

(ii)     The Borrower shall execute and deliver to LaSalle a
Note in respect of Revolving Loans and in respect of
Loans made or to be made under the Term Loan
Facility.

3.                REPAYMENT OF TERM LOANS.

(a)               Term Loan Facility.

The Borrower shall on the first day of each month, commencing

(b)               Mandatory Prepayments of the Term Loan.

(i)      Sale of Assets. Upon receipt of the proceeds of the
sale or other disposition of any Equipment or real
property of the Borrower which is subject to a
mortgage in favour of LaSalle, or if any of the
Equipment or real property subject to such mortgage
is damaged, destroyed or taken by a condemnation in
whole or in part, the proceeds thereof shall be paid
by the Borrower to the LaSalle as a mandatory
prepayment of the Term Loan, such payment to be
applied against the remaining installments of
principal of the Term Loan in the inverse order of
their maturities until repaid in full, and then
against the other Liabilities, in each case as
determined by LaSalle, in its sole discretion.

(c)               VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS.

Subject to SUBSECTIONS 4(c)(iii), (e) AND 9(b), upon payment
to LaSalle of a prepayment fee equal to the amount of any prepayment multiplied
by the percentage in SUBSECTION 9(b) that would apply if this Agreement were
then terminated, the Borrower may prepay the Term Loan at any time, so long as
the amount of such prepayment is equal to or greater than $500,000.

4.                INTEREST, FEES AND CHARGES

(a)               Rates of Interest.

Interest accrued on all Loans shall be due and be paid by the
Borrower on the earliest of: (i) the last day of each month (for such month)
and, in the case of LIBO Rate Loans and BA Equivalent Loans the last day of the
applicable LIBO Interest Period or BA Period, computed through the immediately
preceding day; (ii) the date of acceleration following the occurrence of an
Event of Default in consequence of which LaSalle elects to accelerate their
maturity and payment; or (iii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to SECTION
9 hereof. Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Revolving Loans
made to the Borrower outstanding at the end of each day at a fluctuating rate
per annum equal to one and three quarters percent (1.75%) above the Prime Rate
in the case of Prime Rate Loans, three and one quarter percent (3.25%) above the
BA Equivalent Rate on the first day of the applicable BA Period in the case of
BA Equivalent Loans which rate shall apply during such BA Period, one quarter of
one percent (0.25%) above the U.S. Base Rate in the case of U.S. Base Rate Loans
and three and one quarter percent (3.25%) above the LIBO Rate for the applicable
LIBO Interest Period in the case of LIBO Rate Loans. "LIBO INTEREST PERIOD"
shall mean any continuous period of thirty (30), sixty (60), ninety (90) or one
hundred eighty (180) days, as selected from time to time by the Borrower by
irrevocable notice (in writing, by telecopy, telex, telegram, electronic mail or
cable) given to LaSalle not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the first
day of each respective LIBO Interest Period; provided that: (A) each such period
occurring after such initial period shall commence on the day on which the
immediately preceding period expires; (B) the final LIBO Interest Period shall
be such that its expiration occurs on or before the end of the Maturity Date;
and (C) if for any reason the Borrower shall fail to timely select a period,
then such Loans shall continue as, or revert to, U.S. Base Rate Loans.

<PAGE>

17.

Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Term Loan
made to the Borrower outstanding at the end of each day at a fluctuating rate
per annum equal to one half of one percent (0.50%) above U.S. Base Rate in the
case of U.S. Base Rate Loans and three and one half percent (3.50%) in excess of
the LIBO Rate for the applicable LIBO Interest Period in the case of LIBO Rate
Loans.

The rate of interest payable on Prime Rate or U.S. Base Rate
Loans shall increase or decrease by an amount equal to any increase or decrease
in the Prime Rate or U.S. Base Rate, effective as of the opening of business on
the day that any such change in the Prime Rate or U.S. Base Rate occurs. Upon
and following the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation
thereof, the principal amount of all Loans shall bear interest payable on demand
at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest then in effect under this
SUBSECTION 4(a) plus two percent (2%) per annum.

(b)               Other LIBOR Provisions.

(i)      Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall have the option (A) as of any date, to
convert all or any part of the U.S. Base Rate Loans
to, or request that new Revolving Loans denominated
in U.S. Dollars be made as, LIBO Rate Loans of
various LIBO Interest Periods, (B) as of the last day
of any LIBO Interest Period, to continue all or any
portion of the relevant LIBO Rate Loans as LIBO Rate
Loans; (C) as of the last day of any LIBO Interest
Period, to convert all or any portion of the LIBO
Rate Loans to U.S. Base Rate Loans; and (D) at any
time, to request new Revolving Loans as U.S. Base
Rate Loans; provided, that Loans may not be continued
as or converted to LIBO Rate Loans if the
continuation or conversion thereof would violate the
provisions of SUBSECTIONS 4(b)(ii) or 4(b)(iii) of
this Agreement of if an Event of Default has
occurred.

(ii)     LaSalle's determination of the LIBO Rate as provided
above shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
Furthermore, if LaSalle determines, in good faith
(which determination shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error), prior to the commencement of any
LIBO Interest Period that (A) U.S. Dollar deposits of
sufficient amount and maturity for funding the Loans
are not available to LaSalle in the London Interbank
Eurodollar market in the ordinary course of business,
or (B) by reason of circumstances affecting the
London Interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair
means do not exist for ascertaining the rate of
interest to be applicable to the Loans requested by
the Borrower to be LIBO Rate Loans or the Loans
bearing interest at the rates set forth in SUBSECTION
4(a) of this Agreement shall not represent the
effective pricing to LaSalle for U.S. Dollar deposits
of a comparable amount for the relevant period (such
as for example, but not limited to, official reserve
requirements required by any Governmental Authority
to the extent not given effect in determining the
rate), LaSalle shall promptly notify the Borrower and
(1) all existing LIBO Rate Loans shall convert to
U.S. Base Rate Loans upon the end of

<PAGE>

18.

the applicable LIBO Interest Period, and (2) no
additional LIBO Rate Loans shall be made until such
circumstances are cured.

(iii)    If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or
any change in any applicable law, treaty, rule,
regulation or guideline or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any Governmental Authority
or any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or
other authority having jurisdiction over LaSalle or
its lending offices (a "REGULATORY CHANGE"), shall,
in the opinion of counsel to LaSalle, make it
unlawful for LaSalle to make or maintain LIBO Rate
Loans, then LaSalle shall promptly notify the
Borrower and (A) the LIBO Rate Loans shall
immediately convert to U.S. Base Rate Loans on the
last Business Day of the then existing LIBO Interest
Period or on such earlier date as required by law and
(B) no additional LIBO Rate Loans shall be made until
such circumstance is cured.

(iv)     If, for any reason, a LIBO Rate Loan is paid prior to
the last Business Day of any LIBO Interest Period or
if a LIBO Rate Loan does not occur on a date
specified by the Borrower in its request (other than
as a result of a default by LaSalle), the Borrower
agrees to indemnify LaSalle against any loss
(including any loss on redeployment of the deposits
or other funds acquired by LaSalle to fund or
maintain such LIBO Rate Loan) cost or expense
incurred by LaSalle as a result of such prepayment.

(v)      If any Regulatory Change (whether or not having the
force of law) shall (A) impose, modify or deem
applicable any assessment, reserve, special deposit
or similar requirement against assets held by, or
deposits in or for the account of or loans by, or any
other acquisition of funds or disbursements by,
LaSalle; (B) subject LaSalle or the LIBO Rate Loans
to any Tax or change the basis of taxation of
payments to LaSalle of principal or interest due from
the Borrower to LaSalle hereunder (other than a
change in the taxation of the overall net income of
LaSalle); or (C) impose on LaSalle any other
condition regarding the LIBO Rate Loans or LaSalle's
funding thereof, and LaSalle shall determine (which
determination shall be conclusive, absent any
manifest error) that the result of the foregoing is
to increase the cost to LaSalle of making or
maintaining the LIBO Rate Loans or to reduce the
amount of principal or interest received by LaSalle
hereunder, then the Borrower shall pay to LaSalle, on
demand, such additional amounts as LaSalle shall,
from time to time, determine are sufficient to
compensate and indemnify LaSalle from such increased
cost or reduced amount.

(vi)     LaSalle shall receive payments of amounts of
principal of and interest with respect to the LIBO
Rate Loans free and clear of, and without deduction
for, any Taxes. If (A) LaSalle shall be subject to
any Tax in respect of any LIBO Rate Loan or any part
thereof or, (B) the Borrower shall be required to
withhold or deduct any Tax from any such amount, the

<PAGE>

19.

LIBO Rate applicable to such LIBO Rate Loans shall be
adjusted by LaSalle to reflect all additional costs
incurred by LaSalle in connection with the payment by
LaSalle or the withholding by the Borrower of such
Tax and the Borrower shall provide LaSalle with a
statement detailing the amount of any such Tax
actually paid by the Borrower. Determination by
LaSalle of the amount of such costs shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error. If, after any such
adjustment, any part of any Tax paid by LaSalle is
subsequently recovered by LaSalle, LaSalle shall
reimburse the Borrower to the extent of the amount so
recovered. A certificate of an officer of LaSalle
setting forth the amount of such recovery and the
basis therefore shall be conclusive, absent manifest
error.

(vii)    Each request for LIBO Rate Loans shall be in an
amount less than One Million U.S. Dollars (U.S.
$1,000,000), and in integral multiples of, One
Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (U.S. $100,000).

(viii)   Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower, all Loans
in U.S. Dollars shall be U.S. Base Rate Loans.

(ix)     No more than five LIBO Interest Periods may be in
effect with respect to outstanding LIBO Rate Loans at
any one time.

(c)               Other BA Equivalent Provisions.

(i)      Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall have the option (A) as of any date, to
convert all or any part of the Prime Rate Loans to,
or request that new Revolving Loans denominated in
Canadian Dollars be made as, BA Equivalent Loans of
various BA Periods; (B) as of the last day of any BA
Period, to continue all or any portion of the
relevant BA Equivalent Loans as BA Equivalent Loans ;
(C) as of the last day of any BA Period to convert
all or any portion of the BA Equivalent Loans to
Prime Rate Loans. Any BA Equivalent Loan not repaid
in full on the end of the applicable BA Period or its
acceleration pursuant to SECTION 14 of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be a Prime Rate Loan and shall be
subject to the provisions of this Agreement
applicable to Prime Rate Loans.

(ii)     LaSalle shall not be obliged to advance or convert to
any BA Equivalent Loan during the continuance of any
Default of Event of Default or if such Loan: (A)
matures on a day which is not a Business Day; (B)
matures subsequent to the Maturity Date; (C) has a
term of less than thirty (30) days or more than
ninety (90) days (each such term a "BA PERIOD"); or
(D) is less than One Million Canadian Dollars (Cdn.
$1,000,000), or an integral multiple of One Hundred
Thousand Canadian Dollars (Cdn. $100,000) in excess
thereof.

<PAGE>

20.

(iii)    Subject to the provisions of this Agreement requiring
earlier repayment, no prepayment of any BA Equivalent
Loan shall be made prior to the maturity date of such
BA Equivalent Loan.

(iv)     If, for any reason, a BA Equivalent Loan is paid
prior to the last Business Day of any BA Period or if
a BA Equivalent Loan does not occur on a date
specified by the Borrower in its request (other than
as a result of a default by LaSalle), the Borrower
agrees to indemnify LaSalle against any loss
(including any loss on redeployment of the deposits
or other funds acquired by LaSalle to fund or
maintain such BA Equivalent Loan) cost or expense
incurred by LaSalle as a result of such prepayment.

(v)      Unless otherwise specified by the Borrower, all Loans
in Canadian Dollars shall be Prime Rate Loans.

(d)               Computation of Interest and Fees.

Interest hereunder shall be determined daily, and calculated
monthly not in advance and (in the case of LIBO Rate Loans) at the end of any
applicable LIBO Interest Period, both before and after default and judgment. In
the case of U.S. Base Rate Loans and LIBO Rate Loans, interest shall be computed
on the actual number of days elapsed over a year consisting of three hundred and
sixty (360) days. In the case of Prime Rate Loans or BA Equivalent Loans,
interest shall be computed on the actual number of days elapsed over a year
consisting of three hundred and sixty-five (365) days. For the purpose of the
Interest Act (Canada) only, the yearly rate of interest to which any rate for a
period less than a year is equivalent is such rate, divided by the number of
days in such period, and multiplied by the actual number of days in the year.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, all determinations and calculations
of interest rates and amounts hereunder by LaSalle shall be conclusive absent
(in the case of any calculation of an amount based on a particular rate)
manifest mathematical error in calculating such amount. For the purpose of
computing interest hereunder, all items of payment received by LaSalle shall be
deemed applied by LaSalle on account of the related Loan (subject to final
payment of such items) upon receipt by LaSalle of good funds in LaSalle's
account located in Toronto, Ontario.

(e)               Maximum Interest.

It is the intent of the parties that the rate of interest and
the other charges under this Agreement shall be lawful; therefore, if for any
reason the interest or other charges payable under this Agreement are found by a
court of competent jurisdiction, in a final determination, to exceed the limit
which LaSalle may lawfully charge, then the obligation to pay interest and other
charges shall automatically be reduced to such limit and, if any amount in
excess of such limit shall have been paid, then such amount shall be refunded to
the payor thereof.

(f)               Unused Line Fee.

The Borrower shall pay to LaSalle monthly in arrears on the
first Business Day of each month, an unused line fee equal to three-eighths of
one percent (.375%) per annum on the daily average amount by which the Revolving
Credit Commitment exceeds the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving
Loans, all as defined in this Agreement and all expressed as

<PAGE>

21.

the Canadian Dollar Equivalent Amount thereof. The unused line fee shall accrue
from the Closing Date until the last day of the term of this Agreement.

(g)               Examination and Appraisal Fees.

In addition to the costs and expenses described in SUBSECTION
11(p) hereof, the Borrower shall pay to LaSalle an examination fee equal to
Seven Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars (U.S. $750) per person per day for any
audit, inspection or other activity described in the first sentence of
SUBSECTION 11(c) hereof and conducted or undertaken before or after the date of
this Agreement, plus all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by LaSalle including,
without limitation, travel expenses, payable as incurred.

(h)               Capital Adequacy Charge.

If LaSalle shall have determined that the adoption of any law,
rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or in the
interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by LaSalle with any request
or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law)
from any central bank or Governmental Authority enacted after the Closing Date,
does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on LaSalle's
capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that
which LaSalle could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance
(taking into consideration LaSalle's policies with respect to capital adequacy)
by a material amount, then from time to time, after submission by LaSalle to the
Borrower of a written demand therefor (the "CAPITAL ADEQUACY DEMAND") together
with the certificate described below, the Borrower shall pay to LaSalle such
additional amount or amounts (the "CAPITAL ADEQUACY CHARGE") as will compensate
LaSalle for such reduction in respect of its Loans hereunder. A certificate of
LaSalle claiming entitlement to payment as set forth above shall be conclusive
in the absence of manifest error. Such certificate shall set forth the nature of
the occurrence giving rise to such reduction, the amount of the Capital Adequacy
Charge to be paid to LaSalle, and the method by which such amount was
determined. In determining such amount, LaSalle may use any averaging and
attribution method, applied on a non-discriminatory basis.

5.                LOAN ADMINISTRATION

(a)               Loan Requests.

A request for a Loan shall be made or shall be deemed to be
made, each in the following manner: (i) the Borrower shall give LaSalle same day
notice, no later than 12:00 noon (Toronto time) on such day, of its intention to
borrow a Prime Rate Loan, BA Equivalent Loan or U.S. Base Rate Loan and at least
three (3) Business Days prior notice of its request of a Revolving Loan as a
LIBO Rate Loan, which notice shall be substantially in the form of EXHIBIT 6(a)
hereto (each a "NOTICE OF BORROWING"), provided, however, that no such request
may be made at a time when there exists a Default or an Event of Default; and
(ii) the coming due of any amount required to be paid under this Agreement or
any Note, whether on account of interest or for any other liability, shall be
deemed irrevocably to be a request for a Prime Rate Loan or U.S. Base Rate Loan
as applicable on the due date thereof in the amount required to pay such
interest or other liability. As an accommodation to the Borrower, LaSalle may
permit telephone requests

<PAGE>

22.

for Loans and electronic transmittal of instructions, authorizations, agreements
or reports to LaSalle. Unless the Borrower specifically directs LaSalle in
writing not to accept or act upon telephonic or electronic communications,
LaSalle shall have no liability to the Borrower for any loss or damage suffered
as a result of LaSalle's honouring of any requests, execution of any
instructions, authorizations or agreements or reliance on any reports
communicated to it telephonically or electronically and purporting to have been
sent to LaSalle by the Borrower and LaSalle shall have no duty to verify the
origin of any such communication or the authority of the Person sending it. Each
Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable by and binding on the Borrower. The
Borrower, at its option, may choose BA Equivalent Loans, LIBO Rate Loans, Prime
Rate Loans or U.S. Base Rate Loans for Revolving Loans, and LIBO Rate Loans or
U.S. Base Rate Loans for the Term Loan.

(b)               Disbursement.

The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes LaSalle to disburse
the proceeds of each Loan requested by the Borrower, or deemed to be requested
by the Borrower and to be disbursed or paid by LaSalle, as follows: (i) the
proceeds of each Loan requested under SUBSECTION 5(a)(i) and to be disbursed or
paid by LaSalle, shall be disbursed by LaSalle in Canadian Dollars or U.S.
Dollars as applicable in immediately available funds, in the case of the initial
borrowing, in accordance with the terms of the written disbursement letter from
the Borrower, and in the case of each subsequent borrowing, by wire transfer or
otherwise to such bank account or directly to a supplier as may be agreed upon
by the Borrower and LaSalle from time to time; and (ii) the proceeds of each
Revolving Loan deemed requested under SUBSECTION 5(a)(ii) shall be disbursed by
LaSalle by way of direct payment of the relevant interest or other liability.

6.                SECURITY

all Liabilities;

(f)               General Security Agreement by the Guarantor in favour of

acknowledged by the insurer) in favour of LaSalle; and

(h)               such other security and supporting documents, certificates or
instruments in respect of the Borrower and the Guarantor (including third party
postponement and subordinations, landlord and mortgagee waivers) as may be
required by LaSalle from time to time.

7.                COLLECTIONS

(a)               Blocked Accounts and Lock Boxes.

Until a notice is received by the Borrower from LaSalle as
provided hereinafter, the Borrower shall collect and enforce all of its
Accounts. At and following such time as LaSalle, in its sole discretion, so
notifies the Borrower, the Borrower shall establish U.S. Dollar and Canadian
Dollar accounts (each a "BLOCKED ACCOUNT") in LaSalle's name with a financial
institution acceptable to LaSalle, into which the Borrower will immediately
deposit all payments received by the Borrower (including all payments made for
Inventory or services sold or rendered by the Borrower), in the identical form
in which such payments were made, whether by cash or cheque. At and following
such time as LaSalle, in its sole discretion, so notifies the Borrower, the
Borrower shall direct all of its Account Debtors to make all payments on the
Accounts directly to a post office box (each a "LOCK BOX") with a financial
institution acceptable to, and in the name and under exclusive control of,
LaSalle. All payments received in the Lock Box shall be deposited in the Blocked
Account. If the Borrower, any affiliate or subsidiary corporation of the
Borrower, or any shareholder, officer, director, employee or agent of the
Borrower or any affiliate or subsidiary corporation, or any other Person acting
for or in concert with the Borrower shall receive any monies, cheques, notes,
drafts or other payments relating to or as proceeds of Accounts or other
Collateral, the Borrower and each such Person shall receive all such items in
trust for, and as the sole and exclusive property of, LaSalle and, immediately
upon receipt thereof, shall remit the same (or cause the same to be remitted) in
kind to the appropriate Blocked Account. Each financial institution with which a
Lock Box and Blocked Account are established shall acknowledge and agree, in a
manner satisfactory to LaSalle, that the amounts on deposit in such Lock Box and
Blocked Account are the sole and exclusive property of LaSalle, that such
financial institution has no right to set off against such Lock Box or Blocked
Account or against any other account maintained by such financial institution
into which the contents of such Blocked Account are transferred, and that such
financial institution shall wire, or otherwise transfer in immediately available
funds in a manner satisfactory to LaSalle, funds deposited in the Blocked
Account on a daily basis as such funds are collected. The Borrower agrees that
all payments made to each Blocked Account established by the Borrower or
otherwise received by LaSalle, whether in respect of the Accounts of the
Borrower or as proceeds of other Collateral of the Borrower or otherwise, will
be applied on account of the Liabilities of the Borrower in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The Borrower

<PAGE>

24.

agrees to pay all fees, costs and expenses which the Borrower incurs in
connection with opening and maintaining a Lock Box and Blocked Accounts. All of
such fees, costs and expenses which remain unpaid by the Borrower pursuant to
any Lock Box or Blocked Account agreement with the Borrower, to the extent same
shall have been paid by LaSalle hereunder, shall constitute Revolving Loans
hereunder, shall be payable to LaSalle by the Borrower upon demand, and, until
paid, shall bear interest at the highest rate then applicable to the Revolving
Loans hereunder. All cheques, drafts, instruments and other items of payment or
proceeds of Collateral delivered to LaSalle in kind shall be endorsed by the
Borrower to LaSalle, and, if that endorsement of any such item shall not be made
for any reason, LaSalle is hereby irrevocably authorized to endorse the same on
the Borrower's behalf. For the purpose of this paragraph, the Borrower
irrevocably hereby makes, constitutes and appoints LaSalle (and all Persons
designated by LaSalle for that purpose) as the Borrower's true and lawful
attorney and agent-in-fact (i) to endorse the Borrower's name upon said items of
payment and/or proceeds of Collateral of the Borrower and upon any Chattel
Paper, document, instrument, invoice or similar document or agreement relating
to any Account of the Borrower or goods pertaining thereto; (ii) to take control
in any manner of any item of payment or proceeds thereof; (iii) to have access
to any lock box or postal box into which any of the Borrower's mail is
deposited; and (iv) open and process all mail addressed to the Borrower and
deposited therein; provided, however, that LaSalle shall not exercise any such
powers described in SUBPARAGRAPHS (i), (ii) (except for routine Lock Box
payments/proceeds or through any Blocked Account), (iii) AND (iv) unless and
until an Event of Default has occurred.

(b)               Rights of LaSalle.

LaSalle may, at any time after the occurrence of an Event of
Default, and from time to time thereafter, whether before or after notification
to any Account Debtor and whether before or after the maturity of any of the
Liabilities, (i) enforce collection of any of the Borrower's Accounts or
contract rights by suit or otherwise; (ii) exercise all of the Borrower's rights
and remedies with respect to proceedings brought to collect any Accounts; (iii)
surrender, release or exchange all or any part of any Accounts of the Borrower,
or compromise or extend or renew for any period (whether or not longer than the
original period) any indebtedness thereunder; (iv) sell or assign any Account of
the Borrower upon such terms, for such amount and at such time or times as
LaSalle deems advisable; (v) prepare, file and sign the Borrower's name on any
proof of claim in bankruptcy or other similar document against any Account
Debtor indebted on an Account of the Borrower; and (vi) do all other acts and
things which are necessary, in LaSalle's sole discretion, to fulfill the
Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and to allow LaSalle to collect the
Accounts. In addition to any other provision hereof, LaSalle may at any time on
or after the occurrence of an Event of Default, at the Borrower's expense,
notify any parties obligated on any of the Accounts of the Borrower to make
payment directly to LaSalle of any amounts due or to become due thereunder.

(c)               Application of Collections.

LaSalle shall, upon receipt by LaSalle at its office in
Toronto, Ontario of cash or other immediately available funds from collections
of items of payment and proceeds of any Collateral, apply the whole or any part
of such collections or proceeds against the Liabilities in such order as LaSalle
shall determine in its sole discretion.

<PAGE>

25.

(d)               Dealings by LaSalle.

In its sole credit judgment, without waiving or releasing any
obligation, liability or duty of the Borrower under this Agreement or the Other
Agreements or any Event of Default, at any time or times hereafter, LaSalle may
(but shall not be obligated to) pay, acquire or accept an assignment of any
security interest, lien, encumbrance or claim asserted by any Person in, upon or
against the Collateral. All sums paid by LaSalle in respect thereof and all
costs, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and
disbursements (on a solicitor-client basis) for both inside and outside counsel,
all court costs and all other charges relating thereto) incurred by LaSalle
shall constitute Revolving Loans, payable by the Borrower to LaSalle on demand
and, until paid, shall bear interest at the highest rate then applicable to
Revolving Loans hereunder.

(e)               Receipts by Borrower.

Immediately upon the Borrower's receipt of any portion of the
Collateral consisting of an agreement, Instrument, Document of Title or Chattel
Paper, the Borrower shall deliver the original thereof to LaSalle together with
an appropriate endorsement or other specific evidence of assignment thereof to
LaSalle (in form and substance acceptable to LaSalle). If an endorsement or
assignment of any such items shall not be made for any reason, LaSalle is hereby
irrevocably authorized, as the Borrower's attorney and agent-in-fact, to endorse
or assign the same on the Borrower's behalf.

8.                SCHEDULES AND REPORTS

its chequing and any other accounts held with any financial institution; (y)
such additional schedules, certificates, reports and information with respect to
the Collateral as LaSalle may from time to time require and (z) a collateral

LaSalle's name, in the name of a nominee of LaSalle or in the Borrower's name,
to verify the validity, amount or any other matter relating to any of the
Borrower's Accounts, by mail, telephone, telegraph or otherwise. The Borrower

status report if applicable), including a reconciliation thereof to the above
Borrowing Base calculations, a reconciliation of any perpetual inventory report
to the general ledger and an inventory declaration in form and substance

the Collateral of the Borrower, and all such other financial information, as
LaSalle may request.

9.                TERMINATION

(a)               Survival of Security Interests, Liens, etc.

This Agreement shall be in effect from the date hereof until
January 30, 2007 unless the due date of the Liabilities is accelerated pursuant
to SECTION 14 hereof in which event this Agreement shall terminate on the date
thereafter that the Liabilities are paid in full, provided, however, that the
security interests and liens created under this Agreement and the Other
Agreements shall survive such termination until the date upon which full and
final payment and satisfaction in full of the Liabilities shall have occurred.
At such time as the Borrower has repaid all of the Liabilities and this
Agreement has terminated, (i) the Borrower shall deliver to LaSalle a release,
in form and substance satisfactory to LaSalle, of all obligations and
liabilities of LaSalle and its officers, directors, employees, agents, parents,
subsidiaries and affiliates to the Borrower, and if the Borrower is obtaining
new financing from another lender, the Borrower shall deliver such lender's
indemnification of LaSalle, in form and substance satisfactory to LaSalle, for
cheques which LaSalle has credited to the Borrower's account held at LaSalle,
but which subsequently are dishonoured for any reason and (ii) upon the
Borrower's request and upon receipt of the release and indemnification described
in SUBPARAGRAPH (i) above, LaSalle shall deliver to the Borrower a release in
form and substance satisfactory to LaSalle.

(b)               Prepayment.

If the Borrower terminates this Agreement or reduces the
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment at any time before the end of the term
hereof, the Borrower agrees to pay to LaSalle, as a prepayment fee, in addition
to the payment of all other Liabilities owing by the Borrower (in the case of
any such termination), an amount equal to: (i) three percent (3%) of the amount
of the Aggregate Commitment, or of the amount of the applicable reduction in the
Revolving Credit Commitment, if this Agreement is terminated or such reduction
is made (as applicable) during the first year of the term of this Agreement;
(ii) two percent (2%) of the amount of the Aggregate Commitment, or of the
amount of the applicable reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitment, if this
Agreement is terminated or such reduction is made (as applicable) during the
second year of the term of this Agreement; or (iii) one percent (1%) of the
amount of the Aggregate Commitment, or of the amount of the applicable reduction
in the Revolving Credit Commitment, if this Agreement is terminated or such
reduction is made (as applicable) during the third year of the term of this
Agreement or at any time thereafter. The Borrower and LaSalle acknowledge and
agree that, as a direct and proximate result of the termination of this
Agreement under the aforesaid circumstances, or prepayment otherwise, or
reduction as aforesaid, LaSalle will suffer a loss in an amount which is

<PAGE>

28.

difficult to calculate and determine with certainty and, therefore, as a result
of the Borrower's and LaSalle's reasonable endeavour to ascertain and agree in
advance to the amount necessary to compensate LaSalle for said loss, the
Borrower has agreed to pay the aforesaid prepayment and other fees set out
herein.

Until payment or satisfaction in full of all Liabilities and
termination of this Agreement, unless the Borrower obtains LaSalle's prior
written consent waiving or modifying any of the Borrower's covenants hereunder
in any specific instance, the Borrower agrees as follows:

(a)               the Borrower shall at all times keep accurate and complete
books, records and accounts with respect to all of the Borrower's business
activities, in accordance with sound accounting practices and GAAP consistently
applied, and shall keep such books, records and accounts, and any copies
thereof, only at the addresses indicated for such purpose on SCHEDULE B;

(b)               the Borrower shall promptly advise LaSalle in writing of any
Material Adverse Effect in respect of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or
the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default;

(c)               LaSalle, or any Persons designated by it, shall have the
right, at any time (including, without limitation, through audits (including any
audit of the Borrower's Inventory or Equipment) scheduled within forty-five (45)
days after the Closing Date and thereafter quarterly and more frequently during
the continuance of a Default or Event of Default) to call at the Borrower's
places of business or at any warehouse or storage facility where property or
assets of the Borrower are located at any times, and, without hindrance or
delay, to inspect the Collateral and to inspect, check and make extracts from
the Borrower's books, records, journals, orders, receipts, properties and any
correspondence and other data relating to the Borrower's business, the
Collateral or any transactions between the parties hereto, and shall have the
right to make such verification concerning the Borrower's business as LaSalle
may consider reasonable under the circumstances. LaSalle shall also have the
right to have Persons designated by it conduct such appraisals of Collateral as
it shall require from time to time, including without limitation net orderly
liquidation value appraisals of Inventory not less than semi-annually. The
Borrower shall furnish to LaSalle such information relevant to LaSalle's rights
under this Agreement (including without limitation information on sales,
receivables, collections, accounts payable and inventory aging) as LaSalle shall
at any time and from time to time request. The Borrower authorizes LaSalle to
discuss the affairs, finances and business of the Borrower with any officers or
directors of the Borrower or any affiliate corporation and with those employees
of the Borrower with whom LaSalle has determined it to be necessary or desirable
to converse, and to discuss the financial condition of the Borrower with the
Borrower's independent public accountants. Any such discussions shall be without
liability to LaSalle or to such accountants. The Borrower shall pay to or
reimburse LaSalle for all fees, costs, and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by

by the

<PAGE>

34.

Borrower pursuant to SUBSECTION 4(g) hereof in connection with LaSalle's
examination of Borrower's books and records and Collateral), including without
limitation reimbursing LaSalle on the last day of each month, in arrears, for
the amount of a monitoring fee charged by Collateral Services Inc. (currently
U.S. $65 per month, but subject to change), and all of such costs, fees and
expenses shall constitute Revolving Loans hereunder, shall be payable on demand
and, until paid, shall bear interest at the highest rate then applicable to
Revolving Loans hereunder;

(d)               (i)      the Borrower shall keep the Collateral properly
housed and shall keep the Collateral insured against
such risks and in such amounts as LaSalle may require
and under policies in such form as shall be
satisfactory to LaSalle. Originals or certified
copies of such policies of insurance have been, or on
the Closing Date, shall be, delivered to LaSalle
together with evidence of payment of all premiums
therefor, and shall contain, inter alia, an
endorsement, in form and substance acceptable to
LaSalle, showing loss under such insurance policies
payable to LaSalle. Such endorsement, the other terms
of the said policies, or an independent instrument
furnished to LaSalle, shall provide that the
insurance company shall give LaSalle at least thirty
(30) days written notice before any such policy of
insurance is materially altered or cancelled and
shall include a standard mortgage clause providing,
inter alia, that no act or omission, whether wilful
or negligent, or default of the Borrower or any other
Person shall affect the right of LaSalle to recover
under such policy of insurance in case of loss or
damage. The Borrower hereby directs all insurers
under such policies of insurance to pay all proceeds
payable thereunder directly to LaSalle. The Borrower
irrevocably, makes, constitutes and appoints LaSalle
(and all officers, employees or agents designated by
LaSalle) as the Borrower's true and lawful attorney
(and agent-in-fact) for the purpose of making,
settling and adjusting claims under such policies of
insurance, endorsing the name of the Borrower on any
cheque, draft, instrument or other item of payment
for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and
making all determinations and decisions with respect
to such policies of insurance; provided, however,
that LaSalle shall exercise such rights only upon and
following the occurrence of an Event of Default;

(ii)     the Borrower shall maintain or shall cause to be
maintained, at its expense, such public liability and
third party property damage insurance and business
interruption insurance as is customary for Persons
engaged in businesses similar to that of the Borrower
with such companies and in such amounts, with such
deductibles and under policies in such form as shall
be satisfactory to LaSalle and originals or certified
copies of such policies have been, or on the Closing
Date, shall be, delivered to LaSalle together with
evidence of payment of all premiums therefor; each
such policy shall contain an endorsement showing
LaSalle as additional insured thereunder and
providing that the insurance company shall give
LaSalle at least thirty (30) days written notice
before any such policy shall be materially altered or
cancelled;

<PAGE>

35.

(iii)    if the Borrower at any time or times hereafter shall
fail to obtain, maintain or cause to be maintained
any of the policies of insurance required above or to
pay any premium in whole or in part relating thereto,
then LaSalle, without waiving or releasing any
obligation or default by the Borrower hereunder, may
(but shall be under no obligation to) obtain and
maintain such policies of insurance and pay such
premiums and take such other actions with respect
thereto as LaSalle deems advisable. All sums
disbursed by LaSalle in connection with any such
actions, including, without limitation, court costs,
expenses, other charges relating thereto and legal
fees and disbursements (on a full indemnity basis),
shall constitute Revolving Loans hereunder and, until
paid, shall bear interest at the highest rate then
applicable to Revolving Loans hereunder;

(e)               the Borrower shall not use the Collateral, or any part
thereof, in any unlawful business or for any unlawful purpose or use or maintain
any of the Collateral in any manner that does or could result in material damage
to the environment or a violation of any applicable Environmental Laws, or that
does or could result in an Environmental Claim; the Borrower shall keep the
Collateral in good condition, repair and order, ordinary wear and tear excepted;
the Borrower shall not permit the Collateral, or any part thereof, to be levied
upon under execution, attachment, writs of enforcement, distraint or other legal
process; the Borrower shall not sell, lease, grant a security interest in or
otherwise encumber or dispose of any of the Collateral except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement and the Borrower shall not permit any liens (other
than Permitted Liens) or security interests to attach to the Collateral that
could rank either in priority to, or pari passu to the Security; and the
Borrower shall not secrete or abandon any of the Collateral, or remove or permit
removal of any of the Collateral from any of the locations listed on SCHEDULE B
or in any written notice to LaSalle pursuant to SECTION 10(d) hereof, except for
the removal of Inventory sold in the ordinary course of the Borrower's business
as permitted herein;

(f)               all monies and other property obtained by the Borrower from
LaSalle pursuant to this Agreement will be used solely to pay out existing
indebtedness to Harris Trust and Savings Bank and for ongoing operational
requirements of the Borrower;

(g)               the Borrower shall, at the request of LaSalle, indicate on its
records concerning the Collateral a notation, in form satisfactory to LaSalle,
of the security interest of LaSalle, and the Borrower shall not maintain
duplicates or copies of such records at any address other than the Borrower's
principal place of business set forth on the first page of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Borrower, in the ordinary course of its business,
may furnish copies of such records to its accountants, attorneys and other
agents or advisors as it may determine to be necessary or desirable, in the
exercise of its commercially reasonable judgment;

(h)               the Borrower shall file all required tax returns and pay all
of its taxes when due, including, without limitation, taxes imposed by federal,
provincial or municipal agencies, and shall cause any liens for taxes to be
promptly released; provided, that the Borrower shall have the right to contest
the payment of such taxes in good faith by appropriate proceedings so long as
(i) the amount so contested is shown on the Borrower's financial statements,
(ii) the contesting of any such payment does not give rise to a lien for taxes,
(iii) upon the occurrence of an Event of

<PAGE>

36.

Default, the Borrower keeps on deposit with LaSalle (such deposit to be held
without interest) an amount of money which, in the sole judgment of LaSalle, is
sufficient to pay such taxes and any interest or penalties that may accrue
thereon, and (iv) if the Borrower fails to prosecute such contest with
diligence, LaSalle may apply the money so deposited in payment of such taxes. If
the Borrower fails to pay any such taxes and in the absence of any such contest
by the Borrower, LaSalle may (but shall be under no obligation to) advance and
pay any sums required to pay any such taxes and/or to secure the release of any
lien therefor, and any sums so advanced by LaSalle shall constitute Revolving
Loans hereunder, shall be payable by the Borrower to LaSalle on demand, and,
until paid, shall bear interest at the highest rate then applicable to Revolving
Loans hereunder;

(i)               the Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of

SECTION 10(q)(ii) hereof; or (ii) assume, guarantee or endorse, or otherwise

indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of the Guarantor to the U.S. Lender
pursuant to the U.S. Loan and Security Agreement;

(j)               the Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of

otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or create any new
subsidiary or affiliate or issue any shares of, or warrants or other rights to
receive or purchase any shares of, any class of its stock; the Borrower shall

12(a)(iii), LaSalle shall have received a legal
opinion from the Borrower's counsel, in form and
substance satisfactory to LaSalle and its counsel,
opining with respect to, but not limited to, the
Borrower's and each Loan Party's incorporation and
subsistence, the Borrower's and each Loan Party's
corporate power and capacity to enter into this
Agreement and the Other Agreements, the Borrower's
and each Loan Party's due authorization, execution
and delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Other Agreements, and the enforceability of this
Agreement and the Other Agreements against the
Borrower and each Loan Party, as applicable.

(b)               Post Closing Deliveries.

After the Closing Date, the obligation of LaSalle to make any
requested Loan is subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set
forth in SUBSECTIONS 12(a)(ii), (iii), (iv), (viii), (x) AND (xii) above and
also as set forth below. Each such request shall constitute a representation and
warranty that such conditions are satisfied:

(i)      All representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and the Other Agreements shall be true and
correct on and as of the date of such request, as if
then made, other than representations and warranties
that relate solely to an earlier date; and

(ii)     No Default or Event of Default shall have occurred,
or would result from the making of the requested
Revolving Loan, which has not been waived in writing
by LaSalle.

13.               DEFAULT

The occurrence of any one or more of the following events
shall constitute an "EVENT OF DEFAULT" hereunder:

perform, keep or observe any of the covenants, conditions, promises, agreements
or obligations (other than as described in SUBSECTION 13(a) above) of the
Borrower or such Loan Party under this Agreement or any of the Other Agreements;
provided that any such failure by the Borrower under SUBSECTIONS
11(a),(f),(g),(h),(p),(q),(s) AND (u) of this Agreement shall not constitute and
Event of Default until the fifth (5th) day following the occurrence thereof;

(c)               the making or furnishing by the Borrower or any other Loan
Party or any director, officer, employee or other representative thereof to
LaSalle of any representation, warranty, certificate, schedule, report or other

Agreements or in connection with any other agreement between the Borrower or
such Loan Party and LaSalle, which is untrue or misleading in any respect, or
the failure of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to perform, keep or observe
any of the covenants, conditions, promises, or agreements of the Borrower or
such Loan Party under any other agreement with any Person if such failure, in
the opinion of LaSalle, has or is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Borrower or any other Loan Party;

(d)               the creation (whether voluntary or involuntary) of, or any
attempt to create, any lien or other encumbrance upon any of the Collateral or

other Loan Party or alleging that the Borrower or such Loan Party is insolvent
or unable to pay its debts as they mature or for the readjustment or arrangement
of the Borrower's or any other Loan Party's debts, whether under the Bankruptcy
and Insolvency Act (Canada), the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada)
or the United States Bankruptcy Code or under any other law, whether state,
provincial or federal, now or hereafter existing for the relief of debtors, or
the commencement of any analogous statutory or non-statutory proceedings
involving the Borrower or any other Loan Party; provided, however, that if such
commencement of proceedings against the Borrower or such Loan Party is

proceedings are not forthwith contested in good faith by the Borrower or such
Loan Party and dismissed within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of such
proceedings;

(f)               the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Borrower or

consolidation, of the Borrower or any other Loan Party which is a corporation or

proceedings against the Borrower or

<PAGE>
44.

such Loan Party is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of
Default unless such appointment or proceeding has resulted in a seizure or
possession of any of the Borrower's or any other Loan Party's property or assets
by such receiver or trustee, or is not forthwith contested in good faith by the
Borrower or such Loan Party and revoked or dismissed within fifteen (15) days

granted LaSalle a security interest in or lien upon some or all of such Person's
real and/or personal property to secure directly or indirectly the payment of
all or any of the Liabilities;

(i)               the occurrence of a default or an event of default, which

Thousand Canadian Dollars (Cdn. $50,000) executed or delivered by the Borrower
or any other Loan Party or pursuant to which agreement or instrument the
Borrower or any other Loan Party or its properties is or may be bound;

(j)               the occurrence of any event or condition (including without

of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, or any change in ownership of, or
pledge, transfer, assignment or disposition of, or grant of security in, any
shares of, the Borrower, all as determined by LaSalle in its sole discretion; or

(k)               if the Guarantor shall fail to perform, keep or observe any of

Guarantor to the U.S. Lender under any agreements now or hereafter existing
between the Guarantor and U.S. Lender including the U.S. Loan and Security
Agreement or in the event of the termination of the U.S. Loan and Security
Agreement.

14.               REMEDIES UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT

(a)               Upon the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, LaSalle
shall have no further obligation to make or extend any Loan hereunder or to
grant any other financial accommodation to the Borrower.

(b)               Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in
SUBSECTION 13(e) hereof, all of the Liabilities shall immediately and
automatically become due and payable, without notice of any kind, and upon the
occurrence of any other Event of Default, any or all of the Liabilities may, at
the option of LaSalle, and without demand, notice or legal process of any kind,
be

<PAGE>

45.

declared, and immediately shall become, due and payable. Upon either
occurrence, LaSalle may, in addition to any other right or remedy which it may
have at law or in equity, proceed to realize its security hereunder and to
enforce its rights by:

(i)      entry;

(ii)     the appointment by instrument in writing of a
receiver or receivers of the Collateral or any part
thereof (which receiver or receivers may be any
person or persons, whether an officer or officers or
employee or employees of LaSalle or not and LaSalle
may remove any receiver or receivers so appointed and
appoint another or others in his or their stead);

(iii)    proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a receiver or receivers or for
sale of the Collateral or any part thereof; or

(iv)     any other action, suit, remedy or proceeding
authorized or permitted hereby or by law or by
equity.

In addition, LaSalle may file such proofs of claim and other
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have its claim lodged in
any bankruptcy, winding-up or other judicial proceedings.

(c)               Any receiver or receivers so appointed shall have power to:

(i)      take possession of and to use the Collateral of any
part thereof;

(ii)     carry on the business of the Borrower or any other
Loan Party (including, but not limited to, the taking
or defending of any actions or legal proceedings, and
the doing or refraining from doing all other things
as to the receiver may seem necessary or desirable in
connection with the business, operations and affairs
of the Borrower or any other Loan Party);

(iii)    borrow money required for the maintenance,
preservation or protection of the Collateral or any
part thereof or the carrying on of the business of
the Borrower or any other Loan Party;

(iv)     further charge the Collateral in priority to the
security interests of this Agreement as security for
money so borrowed; and

(v)      sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or any
part of the Collateral on such terms and conditions
and in such manner as the receiver shall determine.

LaSalle shall not be responsible for any actions or errors of
omission by the receiver or receivers in exercising any such powers.

In addition, LaSalle may enter upon, use, occupy and possess
the Collateral or any part thereof, free from all encumbrances, liens and
charges, except for Permitted Liens, without

<PAGE>

46.

hindrance, interruption or denial of the same by the Borrower or any other Loan
Party or by any other person or persons save only a landlord pursuant to its
rights of reversion under any lease of real property on expiry of its term, and
may lease or sell the whole or any part or parts of the Collateral. Any sale
hereunder may be made by public auction, by public tender or by private
contract, with or without notice and with or without advertising and without any
other formality (except as required by law), all of which are hereby waived by
the Borrower. Such sale shall be on such terms and conditions as to credit or
otherwise and as to upset or reserve bid or price as to LaSalle in its sole
discretion may seem advantageous. Such sale may take place whether or not
LaSalle has taken possession of the Collateral.

No remedy for the realization of the security interests
granted pursuant hereto or pursuant to any security held by LaSalle or for the
enforcement of the rights of LaSalle shall be exclusive of or dependent on any
other such remedy, but any one or more of such remedies may from time to time be
exercised independently or in combination. The term "receiver" as used in this
Agreement includes a receiver and manager.

At LaSalle's request, the Borrower shall, at the Borrower's
expense, assemble the Collateral and make it available to LaSalle at one or more
places to be designated by LaSalle. The Borrower recognizes that if the Borrower
fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its Liabilities under this
Agreement or the Other Agreements, no remedy at law will provide adequate relief
to LaSalle, and the Borrower agrees that LaSalle shall be entitled to temporary
and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of
proving actual damages. Any notification of intended disposition of any of the
Collateral required by law will be deemed reasonably and properly given if given
at least fifteen (15) calendar days before such disposition. Any proceeds of any
disposition by LaSalle of any of the Collateral may be applied by LaSalle to the
payment of expenses and any borrowings in connection with the Collateral and its
realization including, without limitation, legal fees and disbursements (on a
solicitor-client basis) of both in-house and outside counsel and any balance of
such proceeds may be applied by LaSalle toward the payment of such of the
Liabilities, and in such order of application, as LaSalle may from time to time
elect or re-elect.

15.               INDEMNIFICATION

(a)               General Indemnity.

The Borrower agrees to defend (with counsel satisfactory to
LaSalle), protect, indemnify and hold harmless LaSalle, each affiliate or
subsidiary of LaSalle, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, attorneys and agents (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against
any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or
nature (including, without limitation, the disbursements and the fees (on a full
indemnity basis) of internal and external counsel for each Indemnified Party in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding,
whether or not the Indemnified Party shall be designated a party thereto), which
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Party
(whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal,
state or local laws or regulations including, without limitation, securities,
environmental and commercial laws and regulations, under common law or in
equity, or based on contract or otherwise) in any manner

<PAGE>

47.

relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Other Agreement, or any act,
event or transaction related or attendant to any of the foregoing, the making
and the management of the Loans or the use or intended use of the proceeds of
the Loans. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify set forth in the
preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or
public policy, the Borrower shall satisfy such undertaking to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law. Any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty,
cost or expense covered by this indemnity shall be paid to each Indemnified
Party on demand, and, failing prompt payment, shall, together with interest
thereon at the highest rate then applicable to Revolving Loans hereunder from
the date incurred by each Indemnified Party until paid by the Borrower, be added
to the Liabilities of the Borrower and be secured by the Collateral. The
provisions of this SECTION 15 shall survive the satisfaction and payment of the
other Liabilities and the termination of this Agreement.

(b)               Environmental Indemnity.

Without limiting the generality of SUBSECTION 15(a), the
Borrower shall at all times indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties
from and against any and all liabilities and costs suffered or incurred by such
Indemnified Parties including, without limitation, any and all orders,
directions, suits, actions, proceedings, claims, settlements, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and
disbursements on a solicitor-client basis, litigation costs and any costs of
settlement), with respect to: (i) any actual or threatened Release of Hazardous
Materials or the presence of any Hazardous Materials affecting any of the
properties of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, whether or not the same
originates or emanates from any such properties or any contiguous property,
including any loss of value of any such properties as a result of any of the
foregoing; (ii) any costs of remedial, preventative or similar action which may
be imposed by any Governmental Authority on the Borrower or any other Loan
Party, including without limitation, any prosecution initiated or threatened
with respect to non-compliance with Environmental Laws, (iii) any costs of
remedial, preventative or similar action incurred by any Governmental Authority
or any costs incurred by any other person or damages from injury to, destruction
of, or loss of natural resources, including costs of assessing such injury,
destruction or loss incurred pursuant to any Environmental Laws; (iv) liability
for personal injury or property damage arising under any statutory, common law,
tort, breach of statutory duty, riparian rights, strict liability or any other
doctrine or theory, including, without limitation, damages assessed for the
maintenance of a public or private nuisance, trespass or for the carrying on an
abnormally dangerous activity at or near any of the properties of the Borrower
or any other Loan Party; (v) any environmental liabilities and costs affecting
any of the properties of the Borrower or any other Loan Party within the
jurisdiction of any Governmental Authority; and/or (vi) any other environmental
liabilities and costs.

including, without limitation, the legality of the interest rate and other
charges, but excluding perfection of the security interests in the Collateral,
which shall be governed and controlled by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction.

(c)               Forum Selection and Service Of Process.

To induce LaSalle to accept this Agreement, the Borrower, for

Loan Parties and LaSalle and their respective successors and assigns and shall
enure to the benefit of the Borrower and LaSalle and their respective successors
and assigns. This Agreement and the Other Agreements may not be modified,
altered or amended except by an agreement in writing signed by the Borrower
and/or the other Loan Parties as applicable and LaSalle. The Borrower may not
sell, assign or transfer this Agreement, or the Other Agreements or any portion
thereof including, without limitation, any right, title, interest, remedies,
powers or duties thereunder. The Borrower, for itself and the other Loan
Parties, hereby consents to LaSalle's sale, assignment, transfer or other
disposition, at any time and from time to time hereafter, of this Agreement, or
the Other Agreements, or of any portion thereof, or participation therein
including, without limitation, LaSalle's right, title, interest, remedies,
powers and/or duties thereunder. The Borrower agrees that it shall execute and
deliver such documents as LaSalle may request in connection with any such sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition.

(e)               Headings of Subdivisions.

The headings of subdivisions in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

49.

(f)               Power of Attorney.

The Borrower, for itself and the other Loan Parties,
acknowledges and agrees that its appointment of LaSalle as its attorney and
agent-in-fact for the purposes specified in this Agreement is an appointment
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until all of the Liabilities
are paid in full and this Agreement is terminated.

(g)               Waiver of Jury Trial, Other Waivers, Confidentiality.

LaSalle and the Borrower (for itself and the other Loan
Parties) hereby waive all rights to trial by jury in any action or proceeding
which pertains directly or indirectly to this Agreement, any of the Other
Agreements, the Liabilities, the Collateral or any alleged tortious conduct or
which, in any way, directly or indirectly, arises out of or relates to the
relationship between the Borrower and LaSalle. In no event shall LaSalle be
liable for lost profits or other special or consequential damages. The Borrower
(for itself and the other Loan Parties) hereby waives all rights to notice and
hearing of any kind prior to the exercise by LaSalle of its rights to repossess
the Collateral without judicial process or to replevy, attach or levy upon such
Collateral without prior notice or hearing, and hereby waives demand,
presentment, protest and notice of non-payment, and further waives the benefit
of all valuation, appraisal and exemption laws. LaSalle's failure, at any time
or times hereafter, to require strict performance of any provision of this
Agreement or any of the Other Agreements shall not waive, affect or diminish any
right of LaSalle thereafter to demand strict compliance and performance
therewith. Any suspension or waiver by LaSalle of an Event of Default under this
Agreement or any default under any of the Other Agreements shall not suspend,
waive or affect any other Event of Default under this Agreement or any other
default under any of the Other Agreements, whether the same is prior or
subsequent thereto and whether of the same or of a different kind or character.
No delay on the part of LaSalle in the exercise of any right or remedy under
this Agreement or any Other Agreement shall preclude other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any right or remedy. None of the undertakings,
agreements, warranties, covenants and representations contained in this
Agreement or any of the Other Agreements and no Event of Default under this
Agreement or default under any of the Other Agreements shall be deemed to have
been suspended or waived by LaSalle unless such suspension or waiver is in
writing, signed by two duly authorized officers of LaSalle and directed to the
Borrower specifying such suspension or waiver.

(h)               Timing of Payments.

Any payment required to be made by the Borrower to LaSalle
hereunder or under any security shall be made in the currency in respect of
which the obligation requiring such payment arose. Any payment received by
LaSalle after 3:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on a Business Day, or on any day that is
not a Business Day, shall be credited to the account of the Borrower as
applicable on the next following Business Day.

(i)               Canadian Currency.

All dollar amounts specified herein are in Canadian Dollars
unless otherwise indicated.

<PAGE>
50.

(j)               Judgment Currency.

If in the recovery by LaSalle of any amount owing hereunder or
under any of the Other Agreements in any currency, judgment can only be obtained
in another currency and because of changes in the exchange rate of such
currencies between the date of judgment and payment in full of the amount of
such judgment, the amount of recovery under the judgment differs from the full
amount owing hereunder, the Borrower shall pay any such shortfall to LaSalle;
such shortfall can be claimed by LaSalle against the Borrower as an alternative
or additional cause of action and any surplus received by LaSalle will be repaid
to the Borrower.

(k)               Severability.

In the event any provision of this Agreement is for any reason
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

(l)               Conflicts.

In the event there occurs any conflict or inconsistency
between any provision of this Agreement and any provision of the Other
Agreements, the provision of this Agreement shall govern.

(m)               Counterparts.

This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents,
acknowledgements or supplements may be executed in number of counterparts and by

executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all of which
counterparts together shall constitute but one agreement.

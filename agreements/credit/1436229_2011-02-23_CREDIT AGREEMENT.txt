Principal amounts repaid on the Revolving Note may be re-borrowed. The principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time shall bear interest at the Interest Rate. The Receivables Collection Fee and accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time shall be payable on a bi-monthly basis on the bi-monthly anniversary date of the Closing Date,















13





















commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof and on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date (each a "Payment Date"). Any amount of principal or interest on the Revolving Loans which is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, shall at Lender's option bear interest payable on demand at the Default Rate.





(d)  Revolving Loan Principal Repayments.





(i) Mandatory Principal Prepayments; Overadvances. All Revolving Loans hereunder shall be repaid by Borrower on or before the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, unless payable sooner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. In the event the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans hereunder exceed the Revolving Loan Availability, Borrower shall, upon notice or demand from Lender , immediately make such repayments of the Revolving Loans or take such other actions as shall be necessary to eliminate such excess. Lender shall apply funds (in excess of any recurring fees owed under Section 2.2, fees owed to any custodian/bac
k-up servicer, interest owed under Section 2.4 and the Receivable Collection Fee) received from the Lock Box Account as payment against the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans on any Payment Date, at Lender's sole discretion.





(ii) Optional Prepayments. Borrower may from time to time prepay the Revolving Loan, in whole or in part,  provided, however, that if prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, Borrower prepays the entire outstanding amount of the Revolving Loan in full and then terminates the Revolving Loan Commitment, Borrower shall pay to Lender as liquidated damages and compensation for the costs of being prepared to make funds available hereunder an amount equal to Five Percent (5%) of the Revolving Loan Commitment (the "Prepayment Penalty") except in the case of an Early Termination Notice. The parties agree that the
amount payable pursuant to this subsection (ii) is a reasonable calculation of Lender's lost profits in view of the difficulties and impracticality of determining actual damages resulting from an early termination of the Revolving Loan Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Prepayment Penalty shall not apply during the first One-Hundred Eighty (180) days following the Closing Date.





(e)  Collections; Lock Box.





(i) Borrower shall direct all of its Account Debtors in the U.S. and the United Kingdom to make all payments on the Accounts directly to a post office box designated by, and under the exclusive control of Lender (such post office box is referred to herein as the "Lock Box"). Borrower shall maintain an account at Wells Fargo, N.A. (the "Lock Box Account"),which Lock Box Account is (as of the date hereof) and shall be maintained in Lender's name, into which all payments received in the Lock Box shall be deposited, and into which Borrower
will immediately deposit all payments received by Borrower on Accounts in the identical form in which such payments were received, whether by cash or check. If Borrower, any Affiliate or Subsidiary, any shareholder, officer, director, employee or agent of Borrower or any Affiliate or Subsidiary, or any other Person acting for or in concert with Borrower shall receive any monies, checks, notes, drafts or other payments relating to or as proceeds of Eligible Accounts, Borrower and each such Person shall receive all such items in trust for, and as the sole and exclusive property of Lender, and, immediately upon receipt thereof, shall remit the same (or cause the same to be remitted) in kind to the Lock Box Account. Borrower and,Lender agree















14





















that all payments made to such Lock Box Account, whether in respect of the Eligible Accounts or as proceeds of other collateral or otherwise (except for proceeds of collateral which are required to be delivered to the holder of a Permitted Lien which is prior in right of payment), will be swept from the Lock Box Account to Lender on each Payment Date to be applied according to the following priorities: (1) to unpaid fees and expenses due hereunder including, without limitation, any recurring fees due pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof, (2) to any custodian/hack-up servicer (if applicable), (3) to accrued but unpaid interest owed under Section 2.4 hereof, (4) to any accrued but unpaid Receivable Collection F
ee, (5) to amounts payable pursuant to Section  2.1(d)(ii), and (6) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to Lender, to reduce the outstanding Revolving Loan balance to zero. Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable customary fees, costs and expenses in connection with opening and maintaining the Lock Box and Lock Box Account. All of such reasonable fees, costs and expenses if not paid by Borrower within five (5) business days of Lender's written request, may be paid by Lender and in such event all amounts paid by Lender shall constitute Obligations hereunder, shall be payable to Lender by Borrower upon demand, and, until paid, shall bear interest at the lowest rate then applicable to Loans hereunder. All checks, drafts, instruments and other items of payment or proceeds of collateral shall be endorsed by Borrower to Lender, and, if that endorsement of any such item s
hall not be made for any reason, Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized to endorse the same on Borrower's behalf. For purpose of this Section, Borrower irrevocably hereby makes, constitutes and appoints Lender (and all Persons designated by Lender for that purpose) as Borrower's true and lawful attorney and agent-in-fact (i) to endorse Borrower's name upon said items of payment and/or proceeds of collateral and upon any chattel paper, document, instrument, invoice or similar document or agreement relating to any Accounts of Borrower; (ii) to take control in any manner of any item of payment or proceeds thereof and (iii) to have access to any lock box or postal box into which any of Borrower's mail is deposited, and open and process all mail addressed to Borrower and deposited therein.





(ii) Lender may, at any time and from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, whether before or after notification to any Account Debtor and whether before or after the maturity of any of the Obligations, (i) enforce collection of any of Borrower's Accounts or other amounts owed to Borrower by suit or otherwise; (ii) exercise all of Borrower's rights and remedies with respect to proceedings brought to collect any Accounts or other amounts owed to Borrower; (iii) surrender, release or exchange all or any part of any Accounts or other amounts owed to Borrower, or compromise or extend or renew for any period (whether or not longer than the original period) any indebtedness thereunder; (iv) sell or assign any Account of Borrower or other amount owed to Borrower upon such terms, for such am
ount and at such time or times as Lender deems advisable; (v) prepare, file and sign Borrower's name on any proof of claim in bankruptcy or other similar document against any Account Debtor or other Person obligated to Borrower; and (vi) do all other acts and things which are necessary, in Lender's sole discretion, to fulfill Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to allow Lender to collect the Accounts or other amounts owed to Borrower. In addition to any other provision hereof, Lender may at any time, whether before or after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at Borrower's expense, notify any parties obligated on any of the Accounts to make payment directly to Lender of any amounts due or to become due thereunder.















15





















(iii) On a monthly basis, Lender shall deliver to Borrower an invoice and an account statement showing all Loans, charges and payments, which shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Borrower unless Borrower notifies Lender in writing, specifying any error therein, within thirty (30) days of the date such account statement is sent to Borrower and any such notice shall only constitute an objection to the items specifically identified.





2.2  Fees.





(a)   Unused Commitment Fee. Borrower agrees to pay to Lender a non-utilization fee equal to one percent (1%) per annum ("Non-Utilization Fee") of the total of (a) the Revolving Loan Commitment, less (b) the sum of the daily average of the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding which non-utilization fee shall be (A) calculated on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days, (B) paid for the actual number of days elapsed, and (C) payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar month, commencing on the last Business Day of the calendar month in which t

To make such election, Borrower shall give written notice to Lender of Borrower's election to renew the Revolving Loan Commitment and extend the Revolving Loan Maturity Date for an additional one year period on or before the Revolving Loan Maturity Date and shall deliver a renewal fee equal to Two Percent (2%) of the then outstanding balance of the Revolving Loan at the subsequent closing. Along the above-referenced renewal notice, Borrower may request that cos

3.             CONDITIONS OF BORROWING.





Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the obligation of Lender to disburse or make all or any portion of any the Loans is subject to satisfaction of all of the following conditions precedent (unless a condition is waived in writing by Lender) contained in this Article 3.





3.1  Commitment Shares. On or before the Closing Date, Borrower shall:





(a) Issue to Lender One Hundred Thousand (100,000) shares of Borrower's Common Stock (the "Restricted Stock"),which shall have (i) piggy back registration rights as part of any registration statement that is filed by Borrower, and (ii) full ratchet rights and anti-dilution rights during the Anti-Dilution Period. Borrower agrees that if Borrower issues any securities or options to purchase securities (other than an issuance pursuant to obligations to shareholders and/or noteholders existing as of the Closing Date and under Borrower's employee stock ownership plan) during the Anti-Dilution Perio
d to any Person other than Lender or an Affiliate of Lender, Lender shall be entitled to an additional issuance from Borrower of a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to allow Lender to maintain the same percentage ownership of shares of Borrower's Common Stock as that acquired by Lender on the Closing Date (not taking into account the Preferred Stock); and





(b) Create and issue to Lender Twenty-Five Thousand (25,000) shares of Borrower's Series A convertible preferred stock (the "Preferred Stock") with a par value of .001. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to the rights as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. Furthermore, Borrower and Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that the Preferred Stock:





(i) subject to (ii) below, shall be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock on the one (I) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Conversion Date");





(ii) may only be converted into Common Stock if the aggregate value of the Restricted Stock (the "Restricted Stock Value") as of the Conversion Date is less than Forty-Five Thousand Dollars ($45,000); provided that, Lender and Borrower agree the Restricted Stock Value will be calculated based on the average closing price reported for the 30 trading days immediately preceding but not including the Conversion Date (the "Average Closing Price"); and





(iii) shall convert into an amount of shares of Common Stock (the "Converted Common Stock Shares") based on the following formulas:





Total Number of Converted Common Stock Shares                =(45,000- Restricted Stock Value)


Average Closing Price per share of Common Stock





Number of Converted Common Stock Shares                          =            Total Number of Converted Common Stock Shares


issued upon conversion of one (1) share of                                                         divided by 25,000


Preferred Stock=


















18
























By way of example, if on the Conversion Date the Restricted Stock Value is $20,000, then each share of Preferred Stock would convert into 5 shares of Common Stock or a total of 125,000 Converted Common Stock Shares. In the event that the Restricted Stock Value is $45,000 as of the Conversion Date, then the Preferred Stock will not convert into Common Stock and will be terminated.





3.2 Loan Documents to be Executed by Borrower. As a condition precedent to Lender's disbursal or making of the Loans pursuant to this Agreement, Borrower shall have executed or cause to be executed and delivered to Lender all of the following documents, each of which must be satisfactory to Lender and Lender's counsel in form, substance and execution:

3.9 Due Diligence. The business, legal and collateral due diligence review performed by Lender, including, but not limited to, a review of Borrower's historical performance and financial information, must be acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion. Lender reserves the right to increase any and all aspects of its due diligence in Lender's sole discretion.

The failure to record any such amount or any error in recording such amounts shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower under the Revolving Note to repay the principal amount of the Revolving Loans, together with all interest accruing thereon.





5.             MANNER OF BORROWING.

Said additional costs and/or reductions will be those which directly result from the imposition of such requirement or condition on the making or maintaining of such Loans.

extent of the insurance maintained pursuant to this Section.

ollateral, and (ii) may not pay any claim made by, or against, Borrower in connection with such property, including, but not limited to the Collateral.

other party to such other agreement) to cause such obligation to become due prior to its stated maturity or terminate such other agreement.
















37





















12.6 Assignment for Creditors. Any Credit Party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature; or if a trustee of any substantial part of the assets of such Credit Party is applied for or appointed, and in the case of such trustee being appointed in a proceeding brought against such Credit Party, such Credit Party, by any action or failure to act indicates its approval of, consent to, or acquiescence in such appointment and such appointment is not vacated, stayed on appeal or otherwise shall not have ceased to continue in effect within sixty (60) days after the date of such appointment, and any of t
he foregoing actions or events would have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of such Credit Party to perform under this Agreement or under any other agreement between the such Credit Party and Lender.





12.7 Bankruptcy. Any proceeding involving a Credit Party, is commenced by or against a Credit Party under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation law or statute of the federal government or any state government, and in the case of any such proceeding being instituted against a Credit Party, (i) the Credit Party, by any action or failure to act indicates its or its approval of, consent to or acquiescence therein or (ii) an order shall be entered approving the petition in such proceedings and such order is not vacated, stayed on appeal or otherwise shall not have ceased to continue in effect within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof, and any of the foregoing proceedi
ngs, actions or events would have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of the Credit Party to perform under this Agreement or under any other agreement between the Credit Party and Lender.

The entry of any judgment, decree, levy, attachment, garnishment or other process, or the filing of any Lien against the property of a Credit Party for an amount in excess of $50,000 and which is not fully covered by insurance and such judgment or other process would have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of the Credit Party to perform under this Agreement or under any other agreement between the Credit Party and Lender, unlesssuch judgment or other process shall have been, within sixty (60) days from the entry thereof, (i) bonded over to the satisfaction of Lender and appealed, (ii) vacated or (iii) discharged.





12.9 Material Adverse Effect. A Material Adverse Effect shall occur.





12.10 Change in Control. Except as permitted under this Agreement, any Change in Control; provided, however, a Change in Control shall not constitute an Event of Default if: (a) it arises out of an event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of Borrower (for example, but not by way of limitation, a transfer of ownership interest due to death or incapacity), and (b) within sixty (60) days after such Change in Control, Borrower provides Lender with information concerning the identity and qualifications of the individual or individuals who will be in Control, to Lender's sole satisfaction.





12.11 Collateral Impairment. The entry of any judgment, decree, levy, attachment, garnishment or other process, or the filing of any Lien against, any of the Collateral or any collateral under a separate security agreement securing any of the Obligations and such judgment or other process shall not have been, within thirty (30) days from the entry thereof, (i) bonded















38





















over to the satisfaction of Lender and appealed, (ii) vacated or (iii) discharged, or the loss, theft, destruction, seizure or forfeiture, or the occurrence of any material deterioration or impairment of any of the Collateral or any of the Collateral under any security agreement securing any of the Obligations, or any material decline or depreciation in the value or market price thereof (whether actual or reasonably anticipated), which causes the Collateral, in the sole opinion of Lender acting in good faith, to become unsatisfactory as to value or character, or which causes Lender to reasonably believe that it is insecure and that the likelihood for repayment of the Obligations is or will soon be impaired, time being of the essence. The cause of such deterioration, impairment, decline or depreciation shall include, but is not limited
to, the failure by Borrower to do any act deemed reasonably necessary by Lender to preserve and maintain the value and collectability of the Collateral.





13.           REMEDIES.





Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have all rights, powers and remedies set forth in the Loan Documents, in any written agreement or instrument (other than this Agreement or the Loan Documents) relating to any of the Obligations or any security therefor, or as otherwise provided at law or in equity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lender may, at its option upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, declare its commitments to Borrower to be terminated and all Obligations to be immediately due and payable; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under either Section 12.6, "Assignment for Cr
editors", or Section 12.7, "Bankruptcy", all commitments of Lender to Borrower shall immediately terminate and all Obligations shall be automatically due and payable, all without demand, notice or further action of any kind required on the part of Lender. The Credit Parties hereby waive any and all presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and all other notices and demands in connection with the enforcement of Lender's rights under the Loan Documents, and hereby consent to, and waive notice of release, with or without consideration, of the Credit Parties or of any Collateral, notwithstanding anything contained herein or in the Loan Documents to the contrary.





No Event of Default shall be waived by Lender except in writing. No failure or delay on the part of Lender, in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver of the exercise of the same or any other right at any other time; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy hereunder. There shall be no obligation on the part of Lender to exercise any remedy available to Lender in any order. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided at law or in equity. Each Credit Party agrees that in the event that a Credit Party fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its Obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, the Revolving Note, the Guar
anties or any other agreements with Lender, no remedy of law will provide adequate relief to Lender, and further agrees that Lender shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.

14.19 Indemnification. Borrower agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless Lender and all of its officers, directors, employees and agents (including, without limitation, those retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each, a "Lender Indemnitee" and collectively, the "Lender Indemnitees") from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and distributions of any kind or nature (including, without limitation, the disbursements and the reasonable fees of counsel for each Lender Indemnitee thereto,), which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Lender Indemnitee (whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or local laws or regulations, including, without limitation, securities, Environmental Laws and commercial laws and regulations, under common law or in equity, or based on contract or otherwise) in any manner relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, or any act, event or transaction related or attendant thereto, the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, including, but not limited to, the making or issuance and management of the Loans, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans, the enforcement o
f Lender's rights and remedies under this Agreement, the Loan Documents, the Revolving Note, any other instruments and documents delivered hereunder, or under any other agreement between Borrower and Lender; provided, however, that Borrower shall not have any obligations hereunder to any Lender Indemnitee with respect to matters caused by or resulting from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Lender Indemnitee. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall satisfy such undertaking to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, cost or expense covered by this indemnity shall be paid to each Lender Indemnitee on demand, and, failing prompt payment, shall, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date incurred by each Lender Indemnitee until pa
id by Borrower, be added to the Obligations of Borrower and be secured by the Collateral. The provisions of this Section shall survive the satisfaction and payment of the other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years.





14.20 Release. In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Borrower hereby agrees to fully, finally and forever release and forever discharge and covenant not to sue Lender, and/or and its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions, and their respective attorneys, officers, directors, agents, shareholders, members, employees, predecessors, successors, assigns, personal representatives, partners, heirs and executors from any and all debts, fees, attorneys' fees, liens, costs, expenses, damages, sums of money, accounts, bonds, bills, covenants, promises, judgm
ents, charges, demands, claims, causes of action, suits, liabilities, expenses, obligations or contracts of any kind whatsoever, whether in law or in equity, whether asserted or unasserted, whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent, under statute or otherwise, from the beginning of time through the Closing Date including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and all claims relating to or arising out of any financing transactions, credit facilities, debentures, security agreements, and other agreements including, without limitation, each of the Loan Documents, entered into by Borrower with Lender and any and all claims that Borrower does not know or suspect to exist, whether through ignorance, oversight, error, negligence, or otherwise, and which, if known, would materially affect their decision to enter into this Agreement or the related Loan Documents.















44





















14.21 Interpretation. If any provision in this Agreement requires judicial or similar interpretation, the judicial or other such body interpreting or construing such provision shall not apply the assumption that the terms hereof shall be more strictly construed against one party because of the rule that an instrument must be construed more strictly against the party which itself or through its agents prepared the same. The parties hereby agree that all parties and their agents have participated in the preparation hereof equally.-





14.22 Compliance with Federal Law. The Credit Parties shall (a) ensure that no person who owns a controlling interest in or otherwise controls a Credit Party is or shall be listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person List or other similar lists maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), the Department of the Treasury or included in any Executive Orders, (b) not use or permit the use of the proceeds of the Loans to violate any of the foreign asset control regulations of OFAC or any enabling statute or Executive Order relating thereto, and (c) comply, and cause each of such Credit Party's Sub
sidiaries to comply, with all applicable Lender Secrecy Act ("BSA") laws and regulations, as amended. As required by federal law and Lender's policies and practices, Lender may need to obtain, verify and record certain customer identification information and documentation in connection with opening or maintaining accounts or establishing or continuing to provide services.

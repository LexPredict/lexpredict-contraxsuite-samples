2.1. The Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth and in
reliance upon the representations, warranties and covenants contained herein,
each Bank agrees, severally and not jointly, to make loans (collectively, the
"Loans", and individually a "Loan") to the Borrowers during the period beginning
on the date hereof and ending on August __, 2000 or on the earlier date of
termination in full, pursuant to ss. 2.7 or ss. 8.1 hereof, of the obligations
of such Bank under this ss. 2.1 (August __, 2000 or such earlier date of
termination being herein called the "Revolver Termination Date") in amounts not
to exceed at any time outstanding, in the aggregate, the commitment amount set
forth opposite the name of such Bank on Exhibit A hereto (each such amount, as
the same may be reduced pursuant to ss. 2.7 hereof being hereinafter called such
Bank's "Loan Commitment"). The Banks' collective commitment to make Loans shall
be the "Aggregate Loan Commitment". All Loans shall be made by the Banks
simultaneously and pro rata in accordance with their respective Loan
Commitments. All Loans shall be made to the Borrowers at the main office of
First Union, Broad and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101.

Loans made hereunder may either be revolving credit loans ("Revolving
Credit Loans"), term loans (herein called "Term Loans") or short term advances
("Short Term Advances"), as requested by the Borrowers. As provided below,
Revolving Credit Loans, Term Loans and Short Term Advances may be requested by
the Borrowers, and made by the Banks, at any time and from time to time prior to
the Revolver Termination Date. No request for Loan will be considered by the
Banks if and to the extent the aggregate amount outstanding in respect of all
Loans at any time would exceed the lesser of the Aggregate Loan Commitment or
the Borrowing Base.

(a) Revolving Credit Loans. Borrowers may request Revolving Credit Loans
from time to time up to but not including the Revolver Termination Date.
Revolving Credit Loans shall be Base Rate Loans or LIBO Rate Loans. All
Revolving Credit Loans shall mature and be due and payable on the Revolver
Termination Date; provided, however, that all Revolving Credit Loans due and
payable on the Revolver Termination Date may be converted to a Term Loan, such
Term Loan to mature 48 months from the Revolver Termination Date and be payable
in equal quarterly installments of principal together with all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon.

(b) Term Loans. Borrowers may request Term Loans from time to time and on
the Revolver Termination Date; provided, however, that all Term Loans together
shall not exceed an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of
$30,000,000 from the date hereof through the Revolver


<PAGE>

Termination Date. Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or LIBO Rate Loans, as may
be requested by the Borrowers . Term Loans shall mature and be payable in equal
quarterly installments of principal (together with all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon) over the period requested by the Borrowers at the time of the
Request for Advance which period shall not exceed 60 months.

(c) Short Term Advances. The Agent, in its individual capacity and under
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, shall provide
advances (herein called "Short Term Advances" or "Advances") to Borrowers, from
time to time, as requested by Borrowers, provided that:

(i) the aggregate amount of Short Term Advances outstanding at any one
time shall not exceed $5,000,000 or such lesser amount, if any, as will,
when added to the amount of the Loans then outstanding, aggregate more than
the Aggregate Loan Commitment (or such lesser amount as Borrowers are
entitled to borrow hereunder at such time by reason of the limitation of
the Borrowing Base or otherwise),

(ii) no Short Term Advance shall be outstanding for more than seven
Business Days, and

(iii) no Short Term Advance shall be permitted if within the preceding
seven Business Days there shall not have been at least one day on which no
Short Term Advance shall have been outstanding.

Borrowers shall request a Short Term Advance by delivering a Request For
Short Term Advance (in such form as may be reasonably requested by First Union,
from time to time, the "Request") signed by a Responsible Officer to First
Union, as Agent on or before the date the Short Term Advance is to be made. Upon
receipt of such Request and if the conditions provided herein shall be satisfied
at the time of such receipt, the Agent shall make the Short Term Advance on the
date specified therein.

Short Term Advances shall bear interest at the LIBO Market Index Rate. If
on the seventh Business Day following the making of any Short Term Advance, the
Advance is not repaid by the Company the amount due shall be funded
automatically by a Revolving Credit Loan which Loan shall be made without regard
to any minimum borrowing requirement, condition precedent herein, or Event of
Default hereunder which would otherwise entitle any Bank or the Banks not to
provide such Revolving Credit Loan, and each Bank shall make its proportionate
share of such Revolving Credit Loan.

Within the foregoing limit, Borrowers may request Short Term Advances, pay
them within seven Business Days and request new Short Term Advances. It is
intended, and Borrowers agree, that the Short Term Advance facility shall be
used only for its convenience and need for very short term funds. This facility
shall not be used as a substitute for Revolving Credit Loans by continuously
maintaining a significant amount of Short Term Advances outstanding.


<PAGE>


All Short Term Advances shall be repaid by Borrowers at the Revolver
Termination Date.

(d) Limit for Matlack Leasing, Inc. Borrowers may have Loans outstanding at
any time and from time to time in an aggregate amount up to, but not exceeding
$30,000,000 for borrowings specifically to Matlack Leasing, Inc.

(e) Interest Rate Options. Loans shall bear interest at (i) the Base Rate,
(ii) Adjusted LIBO Rate plus the LIBO Rate Margin or (iii) some combination of
the foregoing, as requested by the Borrowers, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof including the requirements concerning minimum Loan requests
and the requirements that (i) no request may be made which would require more
than one interest rate option or more than one Interest Period to apply to Loans
made on any single date, and (ii), in the case of LIBO Rate Loans, (a) not more
than five such Loans may be outstanding at any one time, and (b) no LIBO Rate
Loan may have an Interest Period extending beyond the Revolver Termination Date.

(f) Maximum Loans Outstanding. Borrowers shall not be entitled to any new
Loan if, after giving effect to such Loan, the unpaid amount of the then
outstanding Loans would exceed the lesser of (i) the Aggregate Loan Commitment
or (ii) the then current Borrowing Base, as stated in the most recent Borrowing
Base Certificate furnished to the Banks as provided herein. For purposes of
determining the amount of Loans outstanding, the Standby Letters of Credit
issued pursuant to ss. 2.2 hereof shall be deemed Loans and shall be added to
the Loans outstanding to determine the aggregate Loans outstanding.

(g) Minimum Loan Amount. Except for Loans which exhaust the full remaining
amount of the Aggregate Loan Commitment which may be in lesser amount, (i) each
Term Loan when made shall be in an amount at least equal to $5,000,000 or, if
greater, then in such minimum amount plus $100,000 multiples , (ii) each
Revolving Credit Loan when made shall be in an amount at least equal to
$150,000, (iii) each LIBO Rate Loan when made (and each conversion of Base Rate
Loans into LIBO Rate Loans) shall be in an amount at least equal to $1,000,000
or, if greater, then in such minimum amount plus $100,000 multiples, and (iv)
each Base Rate Loan when made (and each conversion of LIBO Rate Loans into Base
Rate Loans) shall be in an amount at least equal to $150,000.

(h) Prepayment and Reborrowing. Prior to the Revolver Termination Date and
within the limits of the Aggregate Loan Commitment and the Borrowing Base,
Borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Credit Loans. Except as
provided in ss. 2.1(a) hereof, all Revolving Credit Loans shall mature and be
due and payable on the Revolver Termination Date.

(i) Extensions of the Revolver Termination Date. Not less than 90 days
prior to the Revolver Termination Date, Borrowers may request in writing to
First Union that the Revolver Termination Date be extended for a new 364-day
period. Upon receipt of such request, First Union will promptly distribute
notice of such request to the Banks. The Banks shall notify First Union no less
than 60 days prior to the Revolver Termination Date of their willingness to
establish a new date. If all Banks agree to a new Revolver Termination Date,
First Union, on or before the 30th day prior to the existing Revolver
Termination Date, shall advise Borrowers and the Banks, in writing, that


<PAGE>

the Revolver Termination Date has been extended for 364 days (stating the date
of the new Revolver Termination Date) and this Agreement shall be deemed amended
to such extent.

(j) Loan Commitment Percentages. The obligation of each Bank to make a Loan
to Borrowers at any time shall be limited to its percentage (the "Loan
Commitment Percentage") as set forth opposite its name on Exhibit A hereto
multiplied by the aggregate principal amount of the Loan requested. The
principal amounts of the respective Loans made by the Banks on the occasion of
each Borrowing shall be pro rata in accordance with their respective Loan
Commitment Percentages. No Bank shall be required or permitted to make any Loan
if, immediately after giving effect to such Loan, and the application of the
proceeds of a Loan to the extent applied to the repayment of the Loans, the sum
of such Bank's Loans outstanding would exceed such Bank's Loan Commitment.

(k) Several Obligations. The failure of any one or more Banks to make Loans
in accordance with its or their obligations shall not relieve the other Banks of
their several obligations hereunder, but in no event shall the aggregate amount
at any one time outstanding which any Bank shall be required to lend hereunder
exceed its Loan Commitment.

(l) Payment of Additional Amount. If any principal of a LIBO Rate Loan
shall be repaid (whether upon prepayment, reduction of the Aggregate Loan
Commitment after acceleration or for any other reason) or converted to a Base
Rate Loan prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such LIBO
Rate Loan or if Borrowers fail for any reason to borrow a LIBO Rate Loan after
giving irrevocable notice pursuant to ss. 2.4, it shall pay to each Bank, in
addition to the principal and interest then to be paid, such additional amounts
as may be necessary to compensate each Bank for all direct and indirect costs
and losses (including losses resulting from redeployment of prepaid or
unborrowed funds at rates lower than the cost of such funds to such Bank, and
including lost profits incurred or sustained by such Bank) as a result of such
repayment or failure to borrow (the "Additional Amount"). The Additional Amount
(which each Bank shall take reasonable measures to minimize) shall be specified
in a written notice or certificate delivered to Borrowers by First Union, as
Agent, in the form provided by each Bank sustaining such costs or losses. Such
notice or certificate shall contain a calculation in reasonable detail of the
Additional Amount to be compensated and shall be conclusive as to the facts and
the amounts stated therein, absent manifest error.

2.2. Standby Letters of Credit. First Union, as Agent, under the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on behalf of itself and each other
Bank in the same proportions as each Bank's Loan Commitment bears to the
Aggregate Loan Commitment, shall provide Standby Letters of Credit to Borrowers,
from time to time prior to the Revolver Termination Date, as requested by
Borrowers, provided that (A) the aggregate amount of Standby Letters of Credit
outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $12,000,000 or such lesser amount,
if any, as will, when added to the amount of the Loans then outstanding,
aggregate more than the Aggregate Loan Commitment (or such lesser amount as
Borrowers are entitled to borrow hereunder at such time by reason of the
limitation of the Borrowing Base or otherwise), and (B) no Standby Letter of
Credit shall be for a term longer than one year or the Revolver Termination
Date, whichever is less.


<PAGE>


Borrowers shall request a Standby Letter of Credit by delivering a
completed letter of credit application to First Union on such form as may be
specified by First Union not less than three Business Days prior to the date
specified by Borrowers as the date the Standby Letter of Credit is to be issued.
The standard form of First Union letter of credit application as currently in
effect shall be used.

Standby Letters of Credit shall not bear interest until drawn upon but
shall each be subject to an annual charge, payable quarterly in arrears on the
last Business Day of each calendar quarter from the date of issuance, equal to
the LIBO Rate Margin as currently in effect on the average daily maximum amount
available to be drawn on the outstanding Standby Letters of Credit, computed on
a quarterly basis in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter
based upon Standby Letters of Credit outstanding for that quarter as calculated
by First Union on behalf of the Banks. Borrowers shall also pay an annual fee to
First Union, as Agent, for its own account, payable quarterly in arrears on the
last Business Day of each calendar quarter from the date of issuance, equal to
0.125% of the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn on the
outstanding Standby Letters of Credit, computed on a quarterly basis in arrears
on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter based upon Standby Letters of
Credit outstanding for that quarter as calculated by First Union on behalf of
the Banks.

If any obligation of Borrowers to pay money in connection with any Standby
Letter of Credit is not met when requested by First Union, as Agent, as
permitted by the applicable letter of credit application and the reimbursement
agreement contained therein, the amount due shall be funded automatically by a
Loan which Loan shall be made without regard to any minimum borrowing
requirement, condition precedent herein, or Event of Default hereunder which
would otherwise entitle any Bank or the Banks not to provide such Loan, and each
Bank shall make its proportionate share of such Loan. Any obligation of
Borrowers to pay money in connection with any Standby Letter of Credit or the
application therefor shall be deemed secured as if made as a Loan hereunder. In
the event Borrowers shall terminate the Aggregate Loan Commitment as provided in
ss. 2.6 and shall pay the outstanding principal amount of the Loans in full and
with interest or the Revolver Termination Date shall occur at a time when one or
more Standby Letters of Credit remain outstanding, then Borrowers shall furnish
to First Union, as Agent, within two Business Days such amount of cash, to be
held as cash collateral and invested in certificates of deposit of First Union
with interest payable to Borrowers, as will pay the maximum amount which may be
drawn by beneficiaries of Standby Letters of Credit outstanding at the date of
such termination or the Revolver Termination Date, as applicable.

2.3. The Notes.

(a) Revolving Credit Notes. The Revolving Credit Loans made by each Bank
shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of Borrowers (each such
promissory note as it may be amended, extended, modified or renewed a "Revolving
Credit Note" and together the "Revolving Credit Notes") in principal face amount
equal to such Bank's Loan Commitment, payable to the order of such Bank and
otherwise in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Revolving Credit Notes
shall be dated the date of issuance, shall bear interest at the rate per annum
and be payable as to


<PAGE>

principal and interest in accordance with the terms hereof. Each outstanding
Revolving Credit Loan shall be due and payable as set forth in ss. 2.1 hereof
unless the maturity of said Loans is accelerated as provided in ss. 2.7 or ss.
8.1 hereof. Notwithstanding the stated amount of any Revolving Credit Note, the
liability of Borrowers under each Revolving Credit Note shall be limited at all
times to the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans by each
Bank evidenced thereby, plus all interest accrued thereon and the amount of all
costs and expenses then payable hereunder, as established by each such Bank's
books and records, which books and records shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

(b) Term Notes. The Term Loans made by each Bank at each Borrowing shall be
evidenced by a single promissory note of Borrowers (each such promissory note as
it may be amended, extended, modified or renewed a "Term Note" and together the
"Term Notes" and together with the Revolving Credit Notes, the "Notes") in
principal face amount equal to such Bank's Loan Commitment Percentage of the
aggregate Term Loans made to Borrowers on the date of any Borrowing, payable to
the order of such Bank and otherwise in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C.
The Term Notes shall be dated the date of the applicable borrowing, shall bear
interest at the rate per annum and be payable as to principal in equal quarterly
installments over the number of months to final maturity as requested by
Borrowers and specified in the Term Note, and be payable as to interest in the
amount of the accrued interest at the date of the monthly payment.

2.4. Funding Procedures.

(a) Request for Advance. Each request for a Loan or the conversion or
renewal of an interest rate with respect to a Loan shall be made not later than
11:00 a.m. EST on a Business Day by delivery to First Union of a written request
signed by Borrowers or, in the alternative, a telephone request followed
promptly by written confirmation of the request (a "Request for Advance"),
specifying the date and amount of the Loan to be made, converted or renewed,
selecting the interest rate option applicable thereto, and in the case of LIBO
Rate Loans, specifying the Interest Period applicable to such Loans. The form of
request to be used in connection with the making, conversion or renewal of Loans
shall be that form provided to Borrowers by First Union. Each request shall be
received on the Business Day of the proposed borrowing, conversion or renewal in
the case of Base Rate Loans, and two London Business Days prior to the date of
the proposed borrowing, conversion or renewal in the case of LIBO Rate Loans. No
request shall be effective until actually received in writing by First Union, as
the Agent. Borrowers may not request more than one advance per day. Each request
for advance shall be for Loans at a single interest rate option.

(b) Actions by Agent. Upon receipt of a Request for Advance and if the
conditions precedent provided herein shall be satisfied at the time of such
request, First Union promptly shall notify each Bank of such request and of such
Bank's ratable share of such Loan. Upon receipt by First Union of a Request for
Advance, the request shall not be revocable by Borrowers.

(c) Availability of Funds. Not later than 2:00 p.m. EST on the date of each
Loan, each Bank shall make available (except as provided in clause (d) below)
its ratable share of such Loan, in immediately available funds, to First Union
at the address set forth opposite its name on the signature page hereof or at
such account in London as First Union shall specify to Borrowers and the Banks.
Unless First Union knows that any applicable condition specified herein has not
been satisfied, it will make the funds so


<PAGE>

received from the Banks immediately available to Borrowers on the date of each
Loan by a credit to the account of Borrowers at First Union' aforesaid address.

(d) Funding Assumptions. Unless First Union shall have been notified by any
Bank at least one Business Day prior to the date of the making, conversion or
renewal of any LIBO Rate Loan, or by 3:00 P.M. on the date a Base Rate Loan is
requested, that such Bank does not intend to make available to First Union, such
Bank's portion of the total amount of the Loan to be made, converted or renewed
on such date, First Union may assume that such Bank has made such amount
available to First Union on the date of the Loan and First Union may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding
amount. If and to the extent such Bank shall not have so made such funds
available to First Union, such Bank agrees to repay First Union forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to Borrowers until the date such
amount is repaid to First Union, at the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points
for three Business Days, and thereafter at the Base Rate. If such Bank shall
repay to First Union such corresponding amount, such amounts so repaid shall
constitute such Bank's Loan for purposes of this Agreement. If such Bank does
not repay such corresponding amount forthwith upon First Union's demand
therefor, First Union shall promptly notify Borrowers, and Borrowers shall
immediately pay such corresponding amount to First Union, without any prepayment
penalty or premium, but with interest on the amount repaid, for each day from
the date such amount is made available to Borrowers until the date such amount
is repaid to First Union, at the rate of interest applicable at the time to such
Loan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Bank of its obligation to
fulfill its Revolving Loan Commitment hereunder or to prejudice any rights which
Borrowers may have against any Bank as a result of any default by such Bank
hereunder.

(e) Proceeds of Loan Being Repaid. If the Banks make a Loan on a day on
which all or any part of an outstanding Loan from the Banks is to be repaid,
each Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and
only an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount being
borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be made available by such Bank to
First Union as provided in clause (c).

2.5. Interest.

(a) Base Rate Loans. Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal balance thereof from day to day at a rate per annum which at all times
shall be equal to the Base Rate. Interest on Loans shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, if the Base Rate is equal to
the prime rate of First Union. Interest on Loans shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days, for the actual days elapsed, if the Base Rate is equal to
the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1% annum.

(b) LIBO Rate Loans. Each LIBO Rate Loan shall bear interest from its
effective date on the unpaid principal amount thereof at Adjusted LIBO Rate plus
the LIBO Rate Margin. Interest on LIBO Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days, for the actual days elapsed. Accrued interest on LIBO
Rate Loans with Interest Periods of three months or less shall be due and
payable on the last day of such Interest Period. Accrued interest on LIBO Rate
Loans with Interest Periods of more than three months shall be due and payable
at the end of the third month and on the last day of each three month period
thereafter and on the last day of the Interest Period.

(c) Conversion to Base Rate. Unless Borrowers shall have elected in
accordance with the provisions of ss. 2.4 or this ss. 2.5 that LIBO Rate apply
to the one, two, three or six month period immediately

<PAGE>

succeeding a particular Interest Period, upon the termination of such Interest
Period the applicable Loan shall bear interest at the Base Rate until such time
as Borrowers elect to request a new LIBO Rate Loan for a subsequent Interest
Period.

(d) Renewals and Conversions. Borrowers shall have the right to convert
Base Rate Loans into LIBO Rate Loans, and vice versa, and to renew LIBO Rate
Loans from time to time, provided that: (i) Borrowers shall give First Union, as
Agent, notice of each permitted conversion or renewal; (ii) LIBO Rate Loans may
be converted or renewed only as of the last day of the applicable Interest
Period for such Loans; (iii) without the consent of the Required Banks, no Base
Rate Loan may be converted into a LIBO Rate Loan, and no Interest Period may be
renewed if on the proposed date of conversion an Event of Default, or Potential
Default exists or would thereby occur. First Union, as Agent, shall use its best
efforts to notify Borrowers of the effectiveness of such conversion or renewal,
and the new interest rate to which the converted or renewed Loan is subject, as
soon as practicable after the conversion; provided, however, that any failure to
give such notice shall not affect Borrowers' obligations or the Banks' rights
and remedies hereunder in any way whatsoever.

(e) Interim Payments At Base Rate. If at any time Borrowers request that
Adjusted LIBO Rate plus the LIBO Rate Margin be applicable to a Loan for a
particular Interest Period and a payment of principal is due within such period
(other than on the last day of such Interest Period), only that portion of that
Loan equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Loan less the principal
installment due during such period shall bear interest at Adjusted LIBO Rate
plus the LIBO Rate Margin for such Interest Period. The portion of that Loan
equal to the principal installment due during such period shall bear interest at
the Base Rate.

(f) Reinstatements. The liability of Borrowers under this ss. 2.5 shall
continue to be effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if
at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the payments to the Banks is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of Borrowers or any other
Person, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a custodian, receiver,
trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to Borrowers or any
other Person or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

2.6. Fees.

(a) Closing Fee. Borrowers agree to pay to First Union, as Agent, for the
account of each Bank as compensation to such Bank on its allocation to the
facility a fee (the "Closing Fee") as follows:


Commitment                  Closing Fee
$22,500,000                    0.25%
$20,000,000                    0.25%

The Closing Fee shall be payable on or before the date hereof.


<PAGE>

(b) Unused Commitment Fee. Borrowers agree to pay to First Union, as Agent,
for the account of each Bank as compensation for each Bank's Loan Commitment, a
fee (the "Unused Commitment Fee") computed at the applicable Unused Fee
Percentage per annum on the average daily amount of the unused portion of each
Bank's Loan Commitment accrued from and after the date hereof. The unused
portion of the each Bank's Loan Commitment shall mean each Bank's Loan
Commitment less the principal amount of the outstanding Loans and Standby
Letters of Credit issued hereunder. The Unused Commitment Fee shall be payable
in arrears on the first day of each January, April, July and October, commencing
October 1, 1998 (for the three month period or portion thereof ended on the
preceding day), and on the Revolver Termination Date. The Unused Commitment Fee
shall be calculated on the basis of of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, for the
actual days elapsed.

2.7. Reduction or Termination of Loan Commitments.

(a) Voluntary. Borrowers may at any time, on not less than one Business
Days' written notice, terminate or permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving
Loan Commitment pro rata among the Banks, provided that any reduction shall be
in the minimum amount of $150,000 or a multiple thereof and that no such
reduction shall cause the principal amount of Loans outstanding to exceed the
reduced Aggregate Loan Commitment or the Borrowing Base, whichever is less.

(b) Loan Commitment Termination. In the event the Aggregate Loan Commitment
is terminated, the Revolver Termination Date shall be accelerated to the date of
such termination and Borrowers shall, simultaneously with such termination,
repay the Loans in accordance with ss. 2.9.

2.8. Voluntary Prepayments.

(a) Base Rate Loans. On one Business Day's notice to First Union, Borrowers
may, without penalty, at their option, prepay any Base Rate Loan in whole at any
time or in part from time to time, provided that each partial prepayment shall
be in the minimum principal amount of $100,000 or, if greater, then in multiples
thereof and, if less than $100,000 shall be outstanding, in principal amount
equal to amount remaining outstanding.

(b) LIBO Rate Loans. On three London Business Days' notice to First Union,
Borrowers may, without penalty, at their option, prepay any LIBO Rate Loan in
whole at any time or in part from time to time, provided that each partial
prepayment shall be in the minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 or, if
greater, then in multiples of $100,000 and, if less than $1,000,000 shall be
outstanding, in principal amount equal to amount remaining outstanding provided
that if it shall prepay a LIBO Rate Loan prior to the last day of the applicable
Interest Period, or shall fail to borrow any LIBO Rate Loan on the date such
Loan is to be made, it shall pay to each Bank, in addition to the principal and
interest then to be paid in the case of a prepayment, on such date of
prepayment, the Additional Amount incurred or sustained by such Bank as a result
of such prepayment or failure to borrow as provided in ss. 2.1.

2.9. Payments.


<PAGE>

(a) Accrued Interest. Accrued interest on all Base Rate Loans shall be due
and payable on the first Business Day of each calendar month. Accrued interest
on LIBO Rate Loans with Interest Periods of three months or less shall be due
and payable on the last day of such Interest Period. Accrued interest on LIBO
Rate Loans with Interest Periods of more than three months shall be due and

period thereafter and on the last day of the Interest Period.

Interest on LIBO Rate Loans shall be payable on the last day of the applicable
Interest Period. Each Loan shall mature as provided in ss. 2.1.

(b) Form of Payments, Application of Payments, Payment Administration, Etc.
All payments of principal, interest, fees, or other amounts payable by Borrowers
hereunder shall be applied to the Loans in such order and to such extent as
shall be specified by Borrowers by written notice to First Union at the time of
such payment or prepayment for all payments prior to the Revolver Termination
Date. After the Revolver Termination Date and if Term Loans shall be in
existence, all payments of principal paid by Borrowers hereunder shall be
applied to the Term Loans shall first be applied to the payment then due with
any excess to be applied to payments due under the Term Loans in the inverse
order of their maturities. Such payments shall be remitted to First Union on
behalf of the Banks at the address set forth opposite its name on the signature
page hereof or at such office or account as First Union shall specify to
Borrowers, in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day
when due. Whenever any payment is stated as due on a day which is not a Business
Day, the maturity of such payment shall, except as otherwise provided in the
definition of "Interest Period," be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
and interest and commitment fees shall continue to accrue during such extension.
Borrowers authorize First Union to deduct from any account of Borrowers
maintained at First Union or over which First Union has control any amount
payable under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document which is not
paid in a timely manner. First Union's failure to deliver any bill, statement or
invoice with respect to amounts due under this Section or under any Loan
Document shall not affect Borrowers's obligation to pay any installment of
principal, interest or any other amount under this Agreement when due and
payable.

(c) Demand Deposit Account. Borrowers shall maintain at least one demand
deposit account with First Union for purposes of this Agreement. Borrowers
authorize First Union to deposit into said account all amounts to be advanced to
Borrowers hereunder. Further, Borrowers authorize First Union (but First Union
shall not be obligated) to deduct from said account, or any other account
maintained by Borrowers at First Union National Bank, any amount payable
hereunder on or after the date upon which it is due and payable. Such
authorization shall include but not be limited to amounts payable with respect
to principal, interest, fees and expenses.

(d) Net Payments. All payments made to the Banks by Borrowers hereunder,
under any Note or under any other Loan Document will be made without set off,
counterclaim or other defense.

2.10. Change in Circumstances, Yield Protection.

(a) Certain Regulatory Changes. If any Regulatory Change or compliance by
any Bank with any request made after the date of this Agreement by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System or by any Federal Reserve Bank or other
central bank or fiscal, monetary or similar authority (in each case whether or
not having the force of law) shall (i) impose, modify or make applicable any
reserve, special deposit, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premium or
similar requirement or imposition against assets


<PAGE>

held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans made by, or any other
acquisition of funds for loans or advances by, any Bank; (ii) impose on any Bank
any other condition regarding the Notes; (iii) subject any Bank to, or cause the
withdrawal or termination of any previously granted exemption with respect to,
any tax (including any withholding tax but not including any income tax not
currently causing any Bank to be subject to withholding) or any other levy,
impost, duty, charge, fee or deduction on or from any payments due from
Borrowers; or (iv) change the basis of taxation of payments from Borrowers to
any Bank (other than by reason of a change in the method of taxation of any
Bank's net income); and the result of any of the foregoing events is to increase
the cost to any Bank of making or maintaining any Loan or to reduce the amount
of principal, interest or fees to be received by any Bank hereunder in respect
of any Loan, First Union will immediately so notify Borrowers. If any Bank
determines in good faith that the effects of the change resulting in such
increased cost or reduced amount cannot reasonably be avoided or the cost
thereof mitigated, then upon notice by First Union to Borrowers, Borrowers shall
pay to such Bank on each interest payment date of the Loan, such additional
amount as shall be necessary to compensate that Bank for such increased cost or
reduced amount.

(b) Capital Adequacy. If any Bank shall determine that any Regulation
regarding capital adequacy or the adoption of any Regulation regarding capital
adequacy, which Regulation is applicable to banks (or their holding companies)
generally and not such Bank (or its holding company) specifically, or any change
therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Bank (or its
holding company) with any such request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's
capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance
(taking into consideration such Bank's policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, Borrowers shall
promptly pay to First Union for the account of such Bank, upon the demand of
such Bank, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for
such reduction.

(c) Ability to Determine LIBO Rate. If First Union shall determine (which
determination will be made after consultation with any Bank requesting same and
shall be, in the absence of fraud or manifest error, conclusive and binding upon
all parties hereto) that by reason of abnormal circumstances affecting the
interbank eurodollar or applicable eurocurrency market adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate to be applicable to the
requested LIBO Rate Loan or that eurodollar or eurocurrency funds in amounts
sufficient to fund all the LIBO Rate Loans are not obtainable on reasonable
terms, First Union shall give notice of such inability or determination by
telephone to Borrowers and to each Bank at least two Business Days prior to the
date of the proposed Loan and thereupon the obligations of the Banks to make,
convert other Loans to, or renew such LIBO Rate Loan shall be excused, subject,
however, to the right of Borrowers at any time thereafter to submit another
request.

(d) Yield Protection. Determination by a Bank for purposes hereof of the
effect of any Regulatory Change or other change or circumstance referred to
above on its costs of making or maintaining Loans or on amounts receivable by it
in respect of the Loans and of the additional amounts required to compensate
such Bank in respect of any additional costs, shall be made in good faith and
shall be evidenced by a certificate, signed by an officer of such Bank and
delivered to Borrowers, as to the fact and amount of


<PAGE>

the increased cost incurred by or the reduced amount accruing to such Bank owing
to such event or events. Such certificate shall be prepared in reasonable detail
and shall be conclusive as to the facts and amounts stated therein, absent
manifest error.

(e) Notice of Events. The affected Bank will notify Borrowers of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle such Bank to
compensation pursuant to this Section as promptly as practicable after it
obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation. Said
notice shall be in writing, shall specify the applicable Section or Sections of
this Agreement to which it relates and shall set forth the amount or amounts
then payable pursuant to this Section. Borrowers shall pay such Bank the amount
shown as due on such notice within 10 days after their receipt of the same.

2.11. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if
the adoption of any applicable Regulation, or any change therein, or any change
in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank, or
comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank to (1)
maintain their Loan Commitments, then upon notice to Borrowers by First Union,
the Loan Commitments shall terminate; or (2) maintain or fund their LIBO Rate
Loans, then upon notice to the Borrowers of such event, the Borrowers'
outstanding LIBO Rate Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans.

2.12. Discretion of each Bank as to Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Bank shall be entitled to fund
and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees
fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all
determinations hereunder shall be made as if each Bank had actually funded and
maintained each LIBO Rate Loan during each Interest Period for such Loan through
the purchase of deposits in the relevant interbank market having a maturity
corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the
LIBO Rate plus the LIBO Rate Margin, for such Interest Period.

with such deductibles and covering such risks as are customarily carried by
companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties in
localities where the each of the Borrowers operates.

3.18. Borrowing Base Availability. The aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Loans and L/C Obligations does not exceed the Borrowing Base.

such action. To the knowledge of the Borrowers, no third party with which any

business, financial condition or operations of the Borrowers.

in ?0, the Aggregate Loan Commitment shall automatically terminate and the
Notes, including without limitation accrued interest, shall immediately be due
and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrowers. Any date on which the
Notes and such other Obligations are declared due and payable pursuant to this
ss. 8.1, shall be the Revolver Termination Date for purposes of this Agreement.
From and after the date an Event of Default shall have occurred and for so long
as an Event of Default shall be continuing, the Loans shall bear interest at the
Default Rate.


9. Collateral

9.1. Collateral & Security Agreement. Upon the request of the Required
Banks, as security for the punctual payment in full of all Notes (including all
payments of principal, and interest and other costs contemplated hereby),
Borrowers shall execute and deliver to First Union,


<PAGE>

as Agent, the Security Agreement and such other documents as may be necessary to
constitute and evidence a perfected first priority security interest in the
Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement, hereinafter referred to as the
"Collateral").

9.2. Conditions Subsequent. Upon the request of the Required Banks pursuant
to ss. 9.1 of this Agreement, the Borrowers shall deliver to First Union, as
Agent, immediately following such request:

(a) a Security Agreement, executed by the Borrower, in appropriate form for
recording, where necessary, together with acknowledgment copies of all UCC-1
financing statements filed, registered or recorded to perfect the security
interests of First Union, as Agent for the Banks, or other evidence satisfactory
to First Union, as Agent, that there has been filed, registered or recorded all
financing statements and other filings, registrations and recordings necessary
and advisable to perfect the Liens of First Union, as Agent for the benefit of
the Banks, in accordance with applicable law; provided, however, that Borrowers
shall deliver, within 30 days after receipt of the request of the Required
Banks, certificates of title with encumbrances properly noted thereon to perfect
First Union's lien for the benefit of the Banks;

(b) written advice relating to such Lien and judgment searches as the Banks
shall have requested, and such termination statements or other documents as may
be necessary to confirm that the Collateral is subject to no other Liens in
favor of any Persons (other than Permitted Liens);

(c) evidence that all other actions necessary or, in the opinion of First
Union, as Agent, desirable to perfect and protect the first priority Lien
created by the Loan Documents, and to enhance First Union's ability to preserve
and protect its interests in and access to the Collateral, have been taken.


10. Agent

10.1. Appointment and Authorization. Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
and authorizes First Union, as Agent, to take such action on its behalf and to
exercise such powers under this Agreement and the Loan Documents as are
specifically delegated to it as Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together
with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The relationship
between First Union and each Bank has no fiduciary aspects, and First Union'
duties as Agent hereunder are acknowledged to be only ministerial and not
involving the exercise of discretion on its part. Nothing in this Agreement or
any Loan Document shall be construed to impose on First Union any duties or
responsibilities other than those for which express provision is made herein or
therein. In performing its duties and functions under this Article 10, First
Union does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed, and hereby
expressly disclaims, any obligation with or for Borrowers. As to matters not
expressly provided for in this Agreement or any Loan Document, First


<PAGE>

Union shall not be required to exercise any discretion or to take any action or
communicate any notice, but shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining
from acting upon the instructions of the Required Banks and their respective
successors and assigns; provided, however, that in no event shall First Union be
required to take any action which exposes it to personal liability or which is
contrary to this Agreement, any Loan Document or applicable law, and First Union
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder
unless it shall first be specifically indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or omitting to take any such action. If an indemnity furnished
to First Union for any purpose shall, in its reasonable opinion, be insufficient
or become impaired, First Union may call for additional indemnity from the Banks
and not commence or cease to do the acts for which such indemnity is requested
until such additional indemnity is furnished.

10.2. Duties and Obligations. In performing its functions and duties
hereunder on behalf of the Banks, First Union shall exercise the same care and
skill as it would exercise in dealing with loans for its own account. Neither
First Union nor any of its directors, officers, employees or other agents shall
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any Loan Document except for its or their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, First Union (a) may consult with legal counsel and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it in good faith and in accordance with the advice of such experts; (b)
makes no representation or warranty to any Bank as to, and shall not be
responsible to any Bank for, any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made in or in connection with this Agreement, any Loan Document or in any
written or oral statement (including a financial or other such statement),
instrument or other document delivered in connection herewith or therewith or
furnished to any Bank by or on behalf of any Borrower; (c) shall have no duty to
ascertain or inquire into Borrowers' performance or observance of any of the
covenants or conditions contained herein or to inspect any of the property
(including the books and records) of any Borrower or inquire into the use of the
proceeds of the Loans or (unless the officers of First Union active in their
capacity as officers of First Union on any Borrower's account have actual
knowledge thereof or have been notified in writing thereof) to inquire into the
existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Potential Default;
(d) shall not be responsible to any Bank for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, effectiveness, genuineness, sufficiency,
collectability or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
instrument or document executed or issued pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith, except to the extent that such may be dependent on the due
authorization and execution by First Union itself; (e) except as expressly
provided herein in respect of information and data furnished to First Union for
distribution to the Banks, shall have no duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to provide to any Bank any credit or other
information with respect to Borrower, whether coming into its possession before
the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter; and (f) shall incur
no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
for, and shall be entitled to rely and act upon, any notice, consent,
certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by facsimile
(telecopier), telegram, cable, or other electronic means) believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper party or
parties.


<PAGE>

10.3. First Union as a Bank. With respect to its Loan Commitment and the
Loans made and to be made by it, First Union shall have the same rights and
powers under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents as the other Banks and
may exercise the same as if it were not the Agent. The terms "Bank" and "Banks"
as used herein shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include First Union
in its individual capacity. First Union and any successor Agent which is a
commercial bank, and their respective affiliates, may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of and generally engage in any kind of
business with, any Borrower and its affiliates from time to time, all as if such
entity were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to
any Bank.

10.4. Independent Credit Decisions. Each Bank acknowledges to First Union
that it has, independently and without reliance upon First Union or any other
Bank, and based upon such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own independent credit analysis and decision to enter into
this Agreement. Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently or
through other advisers and representatives but without reliance upon First Union
or any other Bank, and based upon such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or refraining from taking any action under this Agreement or any Loan
Document.

10.5. Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify First Union (to the
extent not previously reimbursed by Borrowers), ratably in proportion to each
Bank's Commitment Percentage, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against First Union in its capacity as Agent in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Loan Document or any
action taken or omitted to be taken by First Union in its capacity as Agent
hereunder or under any Loan Document; provided that none of the Banks shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from First Union' gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each Bank agrees to reimburse First Union, promptly
on demand, for such Bank's ratable share (based upon the aforesaid
apportionment) of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees and
disbursements) incurred by First Union in connection with the preparation,
execution, administration or enforcement of, or the preservation of any rights
under, this Agreement and the Loan Documents to the extent that First Union is
not reimbursed for such expenses by Borrowers.

10.6. Successor Agent. First Union may resign at any time by giving written
notice of such resignation to the Banks and Borrowers, such resignation to be
effective only upon the appointment of a successor Agent as hereinafter
provided. Upon any such notice of resignation, the Banks shall jointly appoint a
successor Agent upon written notice to Borrowers and First Union. If no
successor Agent shall have been jointly appointed by such Banks and shall have
accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after First Union shall have
given notice of resignation, First Union may, upon notice to Borrowers and the
Banks, appoint a successor Agent. Upon its acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder, the successor Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of First Union, and First Union shall
be discharged from its


<PAGE>

duties and obligations as Agent under this Agreement and the Loan Documents.
After First Union' resignation hereunder, the provisions hereof shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
the Agent under this Agreement and the Loan Documents.

10.7. Allocations Made By First Union. As between First Union, as Agent,
and the Banks, unless a Bank objecting to a determination or allocation made by
First Union pursuant to this Agreement delivers to First Union written notice of
such objection within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date any
distribution was made by First Union, such determination or allocation shall be
conclusive on such one hundred twentieth day and only those items expressly
objected to in such notice shall be deemed disputed by such Bank. First Union
shall not have any duty to inquire as to the application by the Banks of any
amounts distributed to them.


11. Miscellaneous

11.1 Modifications and Waivers. No amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
amendment, modification or waiver of any covenant or default located herein, any
Revolving Credit Note, any Term Note or any other Loan Document and no consent
to any departure by Borrowers therefrom shall in any event be effective, unless
the same shall be in writing, and approved by the Required Banks except as
provided below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given; provided, however, that
without the written consent of all of the Banks, no such modification, waiver or
consent shall (a) change the amount or maturity date of the principal of, or
change the rate or extend the time of payment of interest on, any Revolving
Credit Note or Term Note, (b) change the amount of or extend the time of payment
of any fee due under any Loan Document, (c) change any of the amounts and
percentages of the Loan Commitments, (d) change or affect the provisions of ss.
8.1(a), (e) subordinate any Revolving Credit Note or Term Note in right of
payment to any other indebtedness or obligation whatsoever, (f) change or
otherwise modify the definition of "Borrowing Base" or "Required Banks", (g)
change or affect any provision of this ss. 11.1, (h) release any Borrower from
its obligations to repay the Loans and all related fees and expenses, or (i)
release any Collateral once obtained except as expressly provided herein or in
any other Loan Document. No notice to or demand on the Borrowers shall entitle
Borrowers to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.


11.2. Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of First Union or any Bank or
any holder of any Note in exercising any right, power or remedy under any Loan
Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy under any
Loan Document. The remedies provided under the Loan Documents are cumulative and
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.


<PAGE>

11.3. Governing Law. The Loan Documents and all rights and obligations of
the parties thereunder shall be governed by and be construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to
Pennsylvania or federal principles of conflict of laws.

11.4. Participations and Assignments. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges and
agrees that any Bank may at any time, with the consent of the Company and First
Union, as Agent (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld): (a) grant
participations in all or any portion of its Loan Commitment or any portion of
its Note or of its right, title and interest therein or in or to this Agreement
(collectively, "Participations") to any other lending office of such Bank or to
any other bank, lending institution or other entity which has the requisite
sophistication to evaluate the merits and risks of investments in Participations
("Participants"); provided, however, that: (i) all amounts payable by Borrowers
hereunder shall be determined as if such Bank had not granted such
Participation; (ii) such Bank shall act as agent for all Participants; and (iii)
any agreement pursuant to which such Bank may grant a Participation: (x) shall
provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce
the obligations of Borrowers hereunder including, without limitation, the right
to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provisions of this
Agreement; (y) such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not
agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement without the
consent of the Participant if such modification, amendment or waiver would
reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or postpone the date
fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan; and (z) shall not
relieve such Bank from its obligations, which shall remain absolute, to make
Loans hereunder; and (b) assign any of its Loans and its Loan Commitment,
provided that each such assignment shall be in an amount of at least $5,000,000
(unless, after giving effect to such assignment and all other such assignments
by such assigning Bank occurring simultaneously or substantially simultaneously
therewith, such assigning Bank shall hold no Revolving Credit Commitment or any
portion of its Note hereunder). Upon execution and delivery by the assignee to
Borrowers of an instrument in writing pursuant to which such assignee agrees to
become a "Bank" hereunder having the Loan Commitment and Loans specified in such
instrument, and upon consent thereto by Borrower, to the extent required above,
the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise
provided in such assignment with the consent of the Borrower), the obligations,
rights and benefits of a Bank hereunder holding the Loan Commitment and Loans
(or portions thereof) assigned to it, and such Bank shall, to the extent of such
assignment, be released from the Commitment (or portion(s) thereof) so assigned.
In each such instance, the assignee Bank shall be entitled to receive
substituted Notes in its name. Upon receipt of the substituted Notes, the
assignee Bank shall mark the assigned Notes "canceled" and return them to the
Company. Upon each such assignment, the assignee shall pay to First Union, as
Agent, an assignment fee of $3,500.

11.5. Captions. Captions in the Loan Documents are included for convenience
of reference only and shall not constitute a part of any Loan Document for any
other purpose.

11.6. Notices. All notices, requests, demands, directions, declarations and
other communications between the Banks and the Borrowers provided for in any
Loan Document shall, except as otherwise expressly provided, be mailed by
registered or certified mail, return receipt


<PAGE>

requested, or telegraphed, or faxed, or delivered in hand to the applicable
party at its address indicated opposite its name on the signature pages hereto.
The foregoing shall be effective and deemed received three days after being
deposited in the mails, postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid and shall
whenever sent by telegram, telegraph or fax or delivered in hand be effective
when received. Any party may change its address by a communication in accordance
herewith.

11.7. Sharing of Collections, Proceeds and Set-Offs: Application of
Payments.

(a) If any Bank, by exercising any right of set-off, counterclaim or
foreclosure against trade collateral or otherwise, receives payment of principal
or interest or other amount due on any Note which is greater than the percentage
share of such Bank (determined as set forth below), the Bank receiving such
proportionately greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans
held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments shall be made as may be
required, so that all such payments shall be shared by the Banks on the basis of
their percentage shares; provided that if all or any portion of such
proportionately greater payment of such indebtedness is thereafter recovered
from, or must otherwise be restored by, such purchasing Bank, the purchase shall
be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest being paid by such purchasing Bank. The percentage share of
each Bank shall be based on the portion of the outstanding Loans of such Bank
(prior to receiving any payment for which an adjustment must be made under this
ss. in relation to the aggregate outstanding Loans of all the Banks. Borrowers
agree, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that
any holder of a participation in a Loan or reimbursement obligation, whether or
not acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of
set-off or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as
fully as if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of any
Borrower in the amount of such participation. If under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Bank receives a secured claim
in lieu of a set-off to which this Section would apply, such Bank shall, to the
extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a
manner consistent with the rights of the Banks entitled under this Section to
share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

(b) If an Event of Default or Potential Default shall have occurred and be
continuing First Union, as Agent, and each Bank and each Borrower agree that all
payments on account of the Loans shall be applied by First Union, as Agent, and
the Banks as follows:

First, to First Union, as Agent, for any Agent fees then due and payable
under this Agreement until such fees are paid in full;

Second, to First Union, as Agent, for any fees, costs or expenses
(including expenses described in ss. 11.8) incurred by First Union, as
Agent, under any of the Loan Documents or this Agreement, then due and
payable and not reimbursed by Borrowers or the Banks until such fees, costs
and expenses are paid in full;

Third, to the Banks for their percentage shares of the Commitment Fee then
due and payable under this Agreement until such fee is paid in full;


<PAGE>

Fourth, to the Banks for their respective shares of all costs, expenses and
fees then due and payable from Borrowers until such costs, expenses and
fees are paid in full;

Fifth, to the Banks for their percentage shares of all interest then due
and payable from Borrowers until such interest is paid in full, which
percentage shares shall be calculated by determining each Bank's percentage
share of the amounts allocated in (a) above determined as set forth in said
clause (a); and

Sixth, to the Banks for their percentage shares of the principal amount of
the Loans then due and payable from Borrowers until such principal is paid
in full, which percentage shares shall be calculated by determining each
Bank's percentage share of the amounts allocated in (a) above determined as
set forth in said clause (a).

11.8. Expenses; Indemnification. Borrowers will from time to time reimburse
First Union, as Agent, promptly following demand for all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its legal
counsel) in connection with (i) the preparation of the Loan Documents, (ii) the
making of any Loans, and (iii) the administration of the Loan Documents.
Borrowers also will from to time reimburse First Union, as Agent, and each Bank
for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents. In addition
to the payment of the foregoing expenses, each Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify, protect and hold First Union, as Agent, each Bank and any holder of
any Note and the officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates and
attorneys of First Union, as Agent, each Bank and such holder (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and
disbursements of any kind or nature, including reasonable fees and expenses of
legal counsel, which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such
Indemnitee by any Borrower or other third parties and arise out of or relate to
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other matter whatsoever
related to the transactions contemplated by or referred to in this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that Borrowers shall have no
obligation to an Indemnitee hereunder to the extent that the liability incurred
by such Indemnitee has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

11.9. Survival of Warranties and Certain Agreements. All agreements,
representations and warranties expressly made herein shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the making of the Loans hereunder and the
execution and delivery of the Note. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements of Borrowers set forth in ss.
11.8 shall survive the payment of the Loans and the termination of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the
repayment in full of all amounts owed by Borrowers under the Notes or any other
Loan Document and the termination of the Loan Commitment of each Bank.


<PAGE>

11.10. Severability. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction of any provision in or obligation under this Agreement, the Notes
or other Loan Documents shall not affect or impair the validity, legality or
enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations under this Agreement,
the Notes or other Loan Documents or of such provision or obligation in any
other jurisdiction.

11.11. Banks' Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Banks' Rights. The
obligation of each Bank hereunder is several and not joint and no Bank shall be
the agent of any other (except to the extent the Agent is authorized to act as
such hereunder). No Bank shall be responsible for the obligation or commitment
of any other Bank hereunder. In the event that any Bank at any time should fail
to make a Loan as herein provided, the other Banks, or any of them as may then
be agreed upon, at their sole option, may make the Loan that was to have been
made by the Bank so failing to make such Loan. Nothing contained in any Loan
Document and no action taken by Agent or any Bank pursuant hereto or thereto
shall be deemed to constitute the Banks to be a partnership, an association, a
joint venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time
hereunder to each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt, and, subject to
the terms of this Agreement, each Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce
its rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be necessary for any
other Bank to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such
purpose.

11.12. No Fiduciary Relationship. No provision in this Agreement or in any
of the other Loan Documents and no course of dealing between the parties shall
be deemed to create any fiduciary duty by any Bank to any Borrower.

11.13. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS. BORROWERS, FIRST
UNION AS AGENT AND THE BANKS, EACH HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY
STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED WITHIN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA AND
IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT, ANY ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THE NOTES, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY BE LITIGATED IN
SUCH COURTS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION
WITH ITS PROPERTIES, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE NONEXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS AND WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON
CONVENIENS, AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY NOTE, OR SUCH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT.

11.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BORROWERS, FIRST UNION AS AGENT AND THE BANKS,
EACH HEREBY WAIVES ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE
OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS, OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE LENDER/BORROWERS RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED HEREBY. THE SCOPE OF
THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY
BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS


<PAGE>

TRANSACTION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH
OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. BORROWERS, FIRST
UNION AS AGENT AND THE BANKS, EACH ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT TO THE TRANSACTION, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER
IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. BORROWERS, FIRST UNION AS AGENT AND THE BANKS,
EACH FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS
LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL
RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE,
AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS,
MODIFICATIONS, REPLACEMENTS OR RESTATEMENTS TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS, OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE LOANS. IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL
BY THE COURT.

11.15. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement and any amendment hereto
or waiver hereof may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement and any amendments hereto
or waivers hereof shall become effective when First Union, as Agent, shall have
received signed counterparts or notice by fax of the signature page that the
counterpart has been signed and is being delivered to it or facsimile that such
counterparts have been signed by all the parties hereto or thereto.

11.16. Use of Defined Terms. All words used herein in the singular or
plural shall be deemed to have been used in the plural or singular where the
context or construction so requires. Any defined term used in the singular
preceded by "any" shall be taken to indicate any number of the members of the
relevant class.

11.17. Offsets. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver or
prohibition of any Bank's right of banker's lien or offset.

11.18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Notes issued hereunder and the
other Loan Documents constitute the entire understanding of the parties hereto
as of the date hereof with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede any prior agreements, written or oral, with respect hereto or thereto.

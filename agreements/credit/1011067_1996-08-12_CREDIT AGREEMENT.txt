REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT, BORROWING AND
LETTER OF CREDIT PROCEDURES AND NOTE

21
<PAGE>   27

SECTION 2.1.     COMMITMENT. On the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement (including Article V), the Lender agrees to make revolving
loans to the Borrower ("REVOLVING LOANS") in accordance with this SECTION 2.1.

SECTION 2.1.1.   REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT.  From time to time on any
Business Day occurring prior to the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date,
the Lender will make Revolving Loans to the Borrower equal to the aggregate
amount of the Borrowing requested by the Borrower to be made on such day. On
the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, the Borrower may from time to
time borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.

SECTION 2.1.2.   LENDER NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE EXCESS REVOLVING LOANS.
The Lender shall not be required to make any Extension of Credit if,
immediately before or after giving effect thereto, the sum of (i) the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all Revolving Loans plus (ii) the aggregate
outstanding amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds, or would
exceed, the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount.

SECTION 2.1.3.   LENDER'S OPTIONAL ADVANCE. The Lender shall be
permitted, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time to pay on
behalf of the Borrower any Obligations then due and such amount paid shall be
deemed to be a Revolving Loan made to the Borrower on the date of such payment.

SECTION 2.2.     BORROWING PROCEDURE. By delivering a Borrowing Request
to the Lender on or before 12:00 noon, Chicago time, on a Business Day, the
Borrower may from time to time irrevocably request that a Borrowing be made in
a minimum amount of $50,000 and an integral multiple of $50,000, or in the
unused amount of the Revolving Loan Commitment. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, each Borrowing shall be comprised of the type of
Revolving Loans, and shall be made on the Business Day (not less than three nor
more than five Business Days' prior to funding, in the case of LIBOR Loans),
specified in such Borrowing Request (or such later Business Day as the Lender
shall determine to be practicable), and the Lender shall make funds in an
amount equal to such requested Borrowing available to the Borrower by direct
deposit to the account(s) of the Borrower maintained with the Lender specified
in its Borrowing Request.

SECTION 2.3.     CONTINUATION AND CONVERSION ELECTIONS. By delivering a
Continuation/Conversion Notice to the Lender on or before 12:00 noon, Chicago
time, on a Business Day, the Borrower may from time to time irrevocably elect,
on not less than three nor more than five Business Days' notice that all, or
any portion in an aggregate minimum amount of $50,000 and an integral multiple
of $50,000 of any Revolving Loans be, in the case of Prime Rate Loans,
converted into LIBOR Loans or, in the case of LIBOR Loans, be converted into a
Prime Rate Loan or continued as a LIBOR Loan (in the absence of delivery of a
Continuation/Conversion Notice with respect to any LIBOR Loan at least three
Business Days before the last day of the then current Interest Period with
respect thereto, such LIBOR Loan shall, on such last day automatically convert
to a Prime Rate Loan); provided, however, that no portion of the outstanding
principal amount of

22

<PAGE>   28

any Revolving Loans may be continued as, or be converted into, LIBOR Loans
when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Absent an
effective election of the Borrower to the contrary, each Revolving Loan shall
be deemed to constitute a Prime Rate Loan. The Borrower shall not have more
than three LIBOR Loans outstanding at any time.

SECTION 2.4.    Letters of Credit.

(a)   Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Revolving
Loan Commitment may be availed of in the form of standby and commercial
letters of credit issued by the Lender for the account of the Borrower
("LETTERS OF CREDIT"), provided that the Lender shall not be required
to issue any Letter of Credit if, immediately before or after giving
effect thereto, the sum of (i) the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of all Revolving Loans plus (ii) the outstanding amount of all
Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds, or would exceed, the Revolving
Loan Commitment Amount, and the aggregate outstanding amount of all
Letter of Credit Obligations shall in no event exceed $3,000,000 at any
time.

(b)   Each Letter of Credit issued hereunder shall expire by its
terms not later than the Stated Maturity Date.

(c)   Each Letter of Credit shall be payable in Dollars, shall
conform to the general terms and requirements of the Lender for the
issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit (as appropriate) as
to form and substance and shall be a letter of credit which the Lender
may lawfully issue.

(d)   At the time the Borrower requests each Letter of Credit to
be issued (or prior to the first issuance of a Letter of Credit, in the
case of a continuing application), the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to the Lender an application for such Letter of Credit in the
form prescribed by the Lender for a letter of credit of the type
requested, together with such related documentation as the Lender shall
require (such request, application and related documentation,
collectively, a "LETTER OF CREDIT APPLICATION"). The amount that the
Borrower is obligated to reimburse the Lender for each drawing accepted
and paid by the Lender under any Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be
a Revolving Loan for all purposes made on the date of such drawing in a
principal amount equal to the amount of such reimbursement obligation,
shall accrue interest from the date of such drawing as if it were a
Revolving Loan and, for purposes of interest rate elections hereunder,
shall constitute a single Borrowing.

SECTION 2.5.    FUNDING. The Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its
obligation to make, continue or convert LIBOR Loans hereunder by causing one of
its foreign branches or Affiliates (or an international banking facility created
by the Lender) to make or maintain such LIBOR Loan; provided, however, that such
LIBOR Loan shall nonetheless be deemed to have been made and to be held by the
Lender, and the obligation of the Borrower to repay such LIBOR Loan shall
nevertheless be to the Lender for the account of such foreign branch, Affiliate
or international


23
<PAGE>   29

banking facility. In addition, the Borrower hereby consents and
agrees that, for purposes of any determination to be made for purposes of
SECTIONS 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4, it shall be conclusively assumed that the Lender
elected to fund all LIBOR Loans by purchasing, as the case may be, Dollar
deposits in the interbank Eurodollar market.

SECTION 2.6.    NOTE. The Lender's Revolving Loans under the Revolving
Loan Commitment shall be evidenced by the Note payable to the order of the
Lender in a maximum principal amount equal to the original Revolving Loan
Commitment Amount. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Lender to make
(or cause to be made) appropriate notations on its books and records, which
notations, if made, shall evidence, INTER ALIA, the date of, the outstanding
principal of, and the interest rate and Interest Period applicable to the
Revolving Loans evidenced thereby. Such notations shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower absent manifest error; provided, however, that the
failure of the Lender to make any such notations shall not limit or otherwise
affect any obligations of the Borrower.


ARTICLE III

REPAYMENTS, PREPAYMENTS, INTEREST AND FEES

SECTION 3.1.    REPAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS.  The Borrower shall repay
in full the unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Loans upon the Stated
Maturity Date.  Prior thereto, the Borrower:

(a)   may, from time to time on any Business Day, make a voluntary
prepayment, in whole or in part, of the outstanding principal amount of any
Revolving Loans; provided, however, that:

(i)    no such prepayment of any LIBOR Loan may be made on any
day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Revolving
Loan;

(ii)   all such voluntary prepayments shall be made with at
least three but no more than five Business Days' prior written notice
to the Lender; and

(iii)  all such voluntary partial prepayments shall be in an
aggregate minimum amount of $50,000 and an integral multiple of
$50,000;

(b)   shall, on any date when the sum of (i) aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Loans plus (ii) the outstanding amount of all
Letter of Credit Obligations exceeds the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount on
such date, make a mandatory payment to the Lender equal to such excess (which
payment shall be applied first as a prepayment of all Revolving Loans and second
to Letter of Credit Obligations); and

24
<PAGE>   30

(c)   shall, immediately upon any acceleration of the Stated Maturity
Date pursuant to SECTION 8.2 or SECTION 8.3, repay all Revolving Loans and pay
to the Lender an amount equal to all Letter of Credit Obligations then
outstanding, unless, pursuant to SECTION 8.3, only a portion of all Revolving
Loans and/or Letter of Credit Obligations is so accelerated, in which case the
Borrower shall immediately pay to the Lender an amount equal to such portion.

Without limitation to the provisions of SECTION 3.2.2, each prepayment of any
Revolving Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations made pursuant to this SECTION
shall be without premium or penalty, except as may be required by SECTION 4.4.
No voluntary prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loans shall cause a
reduction in the Revolving Loan Commitment Amount.

SECTION 3.2.    INTEREST PROVISIONS.  Interest on the outstanding
principal amount of Revolving Loans shall accrue and be payable in accordance
with this SECTION 3.2.

SECTION 3.2.1.  RATES. All Revolving Loans shall constitute, and accrue
interest as, either Prime Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans. Pursuant to an
appropriately delivered Borrowing Request or Continuation/Conversion Notice, the
Borrower may elect that Revolving Loans comprising a Borrowing accrue interest
at a rate per annum:

(a)   on that portion maintained from time to time as a Prime
Rate Loan, equal to the sum of the Prime Rate from time to time in
effect; and

(b)   on that portion maintained as a LIBOR Loan, during each
Interest Period applicable thereto, equal to the sum of the LIBOR Rate
(Reserve Adjusted) for such Interest Period plus a margin of 1.85%.


All LIBOR Loans shall bear interest from and including the first day of
the applicable Interest Period to (but not including) the last day of such
Interest Period at the interest rate determined as applicable to such LIBOR
Loan. Absent an effective election of the Borrower to the contrary, each
Revolving Loan shall be deemed to constitute a Prime Rate Loan.

SECTION 3.2.2.  POST-MATURITY RATES. After the date any principal
amount of any Prime Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan is due and payable (whether on the
Stated Maturity Date, upon acceleration or otherwise), or after any other
monetary Obligation of the Borrower shall have become due and payable, the
Borrower shall pay, but only to the extent permitted by applicable law,
interest (after as well as before judgment) on such amounts at a rate per annum
equal to the Prime Rate plus a margin of 3%.

SECTION 3.2.3.  PAYMENT DATES. Interest accrued on each Revolving Loan
shall be payable, without duplication:

(a)   on the Stated Maturity Date therefor;

25
<PAGE>   31

(b)   on the date of any payment or prepayment, in whole or in
part, of principal outstanding on such Revolving Loan;

(c)   with respect to Prime Rate Loans, on each Quarterly
Payment Date occurring after the date of the initial Borrowing
hereunder;

(d)   with respect to LIBOR Loans, the last day of each
applicable Interest Period (and, in the case of Interest Periods of 6
months, on the 90th day of such Interest Period);

(e)   with respect to any Prime Rate Loans converted into LIBOR
Loans on a day when interest would not otherwise have been payable
pursuant to CLAUSE (C), on the date of such conversion; and

(f)   on that portion of any Revolving Loans the Stated Maturity
Date of which is accelerated pursuant to SECTION 8.2 or SECTION 8.3,
immediately upon such acceleration.

Interest accrued on Revolving Loans or other monetary Obligations arising under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document after the date such amount is due and
payable (whether on the Stated Maturity Date, upon acceleration or otherwise)
shall be payable upon demand.

SECTION 3.3.    FEES.  The Borrower agrees to pay the fees set forth
in this SECTION 3.3. All such fees shall be non-refundable.

SECTION 3.3.1.  COMMITMENT FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Lender, for the period (including any portion thereof when the Revolving Loan
Commitment is suspended by reason of the Borrower's inability to satisfy any
condition of ARTICLE V) commencing on the Effective Date and continuing through
the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, a commitment fee at a rate per
annum equal to .25% of the sum of the average daily unused portion of the
Revolving Loan Commitment Amount (as it may be permanently reduced at any time
and from time to time by the Lender for any reason). Such commitment fees shall
be payable by the Borrower in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date, commencing
with the first such day following the Effective Date, and on the Revolving Loan
Commitment Termination Date.

SECTION 3.3.2.  FACILITY FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender
a facility fee in an amount equal to .25% of the Revolving Loan Commitment
Amount (without regard to any reduction thereto), payable on the Effective Date.

SECTION 3.3.3.  LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. The Borrower agrees to pay to
the Lender a letter of credit fee with respect to each standby Letter of Credit
issued and outstanding at a rate per annum equal to 1% of the face amount
thereof (as the face amount may be reduced from time to time under the terms
thereof), payable in full by the Borrower at the time of issuance of such Letter
of Credit, plus such other fees and charges with respect to standby Letters of
Credit issued as are published by the Lender from time to time. The Borrower
further agrees to pay to the Lender such

26

<PAGE>   32

fees and charges with respect to import and commercial Letters of Credit issued
as are published by the Lender from time to time.


ARTICLE IV

CERTAIN LIBOR RATE AND OTHER PROVISIONS

SECTION 4.1.    LIBOR RATE LENDING UNLAWFUL. If the Lender shall
determine (which determination shall, upon notice thereof to the Borrower, be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that the introduction of or any change
in or in the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or any central bank or
other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for the Lender to
make, continue or maintain any Revolving Loan as, or to convert any Revolving
Loan into, a LIBOR Loan of a certain type, the obligations of the Lender to
make, continue, maintain or convert any such Revolving Loans shall, upon such
determination, forthwith be suspended until the Lender shall notify the Borrower
that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and all LIBOR
Loans of such type shall automatically convert into Prime Rate Loans at the end
of the then current Interest Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if required
by such law or assertion.

SECTION 4.2.    DEPOSITS UNAVAILABLE.  If the Lender shall have
determined that:

(a)   Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant
Interest Period are not available to the Lender in its relevant market;
or

(b)   by reason of circumstances affecting the Lender's relevant
market, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate
applicable hereunder to LIBOR Loans;

then, upon notice from the Lender to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lender
under Article II to make or continue any Revolving Loans as, or to convert any
Revolving Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall forthwith be suspended until the Lender
shall notify the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.

SECTION 4.3.    INCREASED LIBOR LOAN COSTS, ETC. The Borrower agrees to
reimburse the Lender for any increase in the cost to the Lender of, or any
reduction in the amount of any sum receivable by the Lender in respect of,
making, continuing or maintaining (or of its obligation to make, continue or
maintain) any Revolving Loans as, or of converting (or of its obligation to
convert) any Revolving Loans into, LIBOR Loans. The Lender shall promptly notify
the Borrower in writing of the occurrence of any such event, such notice to
state, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and the additional amount
required fully to compensate the Lender for such increased cost or reduced
amount. Such additional amounts shall be payable by the Borrower to the Lender
within five days of its receipt of such notice, and such notice shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

27
<PAGE>   33

SECTION 4.4.    FUNDING LOSSES.  In the event the Lender shall incur
any loss or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Lender
to make, continue or maintain any portion of the principal amount of any
Revolving Loan as, or to convert any portion of the principal amount of any
Revolving Loan into, a LIBOR Loan) as a result of:

(a)   any conversion, repayment or prepayment of the principal
amount of any LIBOR Loans on a date other than the scheduled last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, whether pursuant to SECTION
3.1 or otherwise;

(b)   any Revolving Loans not being made as LIBOR Loans in
accordance with the Borrowing Request therefor; or

(c)   any Revolving Loans not being continued as, or converted
into, LIBOR Loans in accordance with the Continuation/Conversion
Notice therefor;

then, upon the written notice of the Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall,
within five days of its receipt thereof, pay to the Lender such amount as will
(in the reasonable determination of the Lender) reimburse the Lender for such
loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include calculations in
reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower.

SECTION 4.5.    INCREASED CAPITAL COSTS. If any change in, or the
introduction, adoption, effectiveness, interpretation, reinterpretation or
phase-in of, any law or regulation, directive, guideline, decision or request
(whether or not having the force of law) of any court, central bank, regulator
or other governmental authority affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by the Lender or any Person controlling
the Lender, and the Lender determines (in its sole and absolute discretion) that
the rate of return on its or such controlling Person's capital as a consequence
of the Revolving Loan Commitment or the Revolving Loans made by the Lender is
reduced to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling Person could
have achieved but for the occurrence of any such circumstance, then, in any such
case upon notice from time to time by the Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower
shall immediately pay directly to the Lender additional amounts sufficient to
compensate the Lender or such controlling Person for such reduction in rate of
return; provided, however, that if the Borrower voluntarily prepays the
Revolving Loans in full in accordance with SECTION 3.1 following the aforesaid
notice of the Lender, then the Borrower shall only be obligated under this
SECTION 4.5 to pay the Lender an amount sufficient to compensate the Lender or
such controlling Person for such reduction in rate of return through the date of
such voluntary prepayment. A statement of the Lender as to any such additional
amount or amounts (including calculations thereof in reasonable detail) shall,
in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower. In
determining such amount, the Lender may use any method of averaging and
attribution that it (in its sole and absolute discretion) shall deem applicable.

28
<PAGE>   34
SECTION 4.6.    TAXES. All payments by the Borrower of principal of,
and interest on, the Revolving Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future
income, excise, stamp or other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or other
charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, other than
franchise taxes and taxes imposed on or measured by the Lender's net income or
receipts (such non-excluded items being called "Taxes"). In the event that any
withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder
is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or
regulation, then the Borrower shall:

(a)   pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount
required to be so withheld or deducted;

(b)   promptly forward to the Lender an official receipt or other
documentation satisfactory to the Lender evidencing such payment to
such authority; and

(c)   pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts as is
necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Lender
will equal the full amount the Lender would have received had no such
withholding or deduction been required.

Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against the Lender with respect to
any payment received by the Lender hereunder, the Lender may pay such Taxes and
the Borrower shall promptly pay such additional amounts (including any
penalties, interest or expenses) as is necessary in order that the net amount
received by such person after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on
such additional amount) shall equal the amount such person would have received
had not such Taxes been asserted.

If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate
taxing authority or fails to remit to the Lender the required receipts or other
required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lender for any
incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Lender
as a result of any such failure.

SECTION 4.7.    PAYMENTS, COMPUTATIONS, ETC. All payments by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document shall
be made by the Borrower to the Lender, without set off, deduction or
counterclaim, not later than 12:00 noon, Chicago time, on the date due, in same
day or immediately available funds, to such account as the Lender shall specify
from time to time by notice to the Borrower. Funds received after that time
shall be deemed to have been received by the Lender on the next succeeding
Business Day. All interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of the
actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring during the period for which such interest or fee is payable over a
year comprised of 360 days. Whenever any payment to be made shall otherwise be
due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall (except as
otherwise required by CLAUSE (C) of the definition of the term "Interest
Period" with respect to LIBOR Loans) be made on the next succeeding Business
Day

29
<PAGE>   35

and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest and fees,
if any, in connection with such payment.

SECTION 4.8.    COLLECTIONS; LOCK BOXES. (a) The Borrower shall, upon
demand of the Lender in its sole discretion at any time following a Default,
forthwith, upon receipt, transmit and deliver to the Lender, in the form
received, all cash, checks, drafts, chattel paper and other instruments or
writings for the payment of money (properly endorsed, where required, so that
such items may be collected by the Lender) which may be received by the
Borrower at any time in full or partial payment or otherwise as proceeds of any
of the Collateral. The Borrower shall not commingle any such items which may be
received with any other of its funds or property, but shall hold such items
separate and apart from its own funds or property and in express trust for the
benefit of the Lender until delivery is made to the Lender. The Borrower shall
comply with the terms and conditions of any consent given by the Lender
pursuant to the provisions of this SUBSECTION (a).

(b)   At the option of the Lender, exercised in its sole discretion at
any time after the occurrence of a Default, the Borrower shall direct all
Account Debtors to make all payments with respect to Accounts to one or more
lock boxes established and maintained by, and subject to the exclusive control
of, the Lender, on terms acceptable to the Lender. The Borrower shall cause any
such payments made to any other Person or source (including the Borrower)
promptly to be remitted to such lock boxes, and the Borrower shall not commingle
any such payments received by it, and shall hold them separate and apart from
all other property all such payments received by it in express trust for the
benefit of the Lender until delivery thereof is made to such lock boxes. The
Lender shall deposit (after providing for a clearing hold of two Business Days
after its receipt) all such payments from lock boxes and all payments with
respect to any Collateral into an account (the "COLLATERAL ACCOUNT") maintained
with the Lender over which the Lender shall have the exclusive power to control
(including the power to make withdrawals).

(c)   The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lender, subject to the
provisions of this SUBSECTION (C), at any time after the occurrence of a Default
to apply the whole or any part of any amounts received by the Lender pursuant to
SUBSECTION (A) or (B) of this SECTION 4.8 or otherwise against the principal
and/or interest of any Revolving Loans made hereunder and/or any other
Obligations, whether absolute or contingent and whether or not then due, in such
order of application as Lender may determine, unless such payments or proceeds
are, in the Lender's sole discretion, released to the Borrower; provided,
however, that no checks, drafts or other instruments received by the Lender
shall constitute final payment to the Lender unless and until such item of
payment has actually been collected.

SECTION 4.9.    SET OFF. The Lender shall, upon the occurrence of any
Default described in SECTION 8.1.9 with respect to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of any other Event of Default, have the right
to appropriate and apply to the payment of the Obligations owing to it (whether
or not then due), and (as security for such Obligations) the Borrower hereby
grants to the Lender a continuing security interest in, any and all balances,
credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrower then or thereafter
maintained with the Lender. The Lender agrees

30

<PAGE>   36

promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set off and application made by
the Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set off and application. The rights of the Lender
under this SECTION are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
other rights of set off under applicable law or otherwise) which the Lender may
have.

SECTION 4.10.   USE OF PROCEEDS. The Borrower shall apply the proceeds
of each Borrowing (and shall cause the issuance of Letters of Credit) solely for
the purposes set forth in the recitals hereof; without limiting the foregoing,
no proceeds of any Revolving Loan shall be used to acquire any equity security
of a class which is registered pursuant to section 12 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 or any "margin stock", as defined in F.R.S. Board Regulation U.

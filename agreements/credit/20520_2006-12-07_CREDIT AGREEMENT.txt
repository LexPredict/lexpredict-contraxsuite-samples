This
CREDIT
AGREEMENT
is
entered into as of December 6, 2006, among CITIZENS
COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY,
a
Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”),
COBANK,
ACB
(individually, “CoBank”),
as
the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arranger and a Lender, and such other Lenders
as may from time to time become a party to this Agreement (together with their

herein), collectively, the “Lenders”).
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in Subsection 10.1.



R
E C
I T A L S:




WHEREAS,
the Borrower desires that the Lenders extend to the Borrower a term loan
facility, the proceeds of which are to be available to refinance a portion
of
the Borrower’s existing outstanding Indebtedness; and



NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the agreements, provisions
and
covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree
as follows:



SECTION
1



AMOUNTS
AND TERMS OF TERM
LOAN
FACILITY



1.1 Loan.
Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in reliance upon the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Borrower contained herein
and
in the other Loan Documents:



(A) Term
Loan Facility.
Each
Lender, severally and not jointly, agrees to lend to the Borrower, in a single
advance to be made during the Availability Period, its Pro Rata Share of the
Term Loan Commitment; provided
all
conditions precedent set forth in Subsections
7.1
and
7.2
are
satisfied or waived by the Administrative Agent as provided herein. Amounts
borrowed under this Subsection
1.1(A)
that are
repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.



(B) Notes.
To the
extent requested by a Lender, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such
Lender a Term Loan Note in the principal amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share
of the Term Loan Commitment.



(C) Advances.
The
advance under the Term Loan will be made available by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The wire transfer will be made to such account
or
accounts as may be authorized by the Borrower.



1.2 Interest.



(A) Interest
Options.



(i) From
the
date the Term Loan is made, based upon the election of the Borrower, at such
time and from time to time thereafter (as provided in Subsection 1.3
and
subject to the conditions set forth in such Subsection and Subsection 1.2(G)),
the
Term Loan shall accrue interest as follows:
























Table

Credit
Agreement/Citizens Communications Company







(1) as
a Base
Rate Loan,
at
the
sum of the Base Rate plus
0.25%;
or



(2) as
a
LIBOR Loan, for the applicable Interest Period, at the sum of LIBOR plus
the
LIBOR Margin applicable to such Loan from time to time as provided in
Subsection
1.2(B).



(ii) Except
as
otherwise provided in Subsection
1.2(E),
interest on all Obligations other than interest payments required pursuant
to
Subsection
1.2(A)(i)
above
not paid when due will accrue at the Base Rate plus
0.25%
per annum.



(B) Applicable
Margins.
Initially, and continuing through the day immediately preceding the first
Adjustment Date, the applicable LIBOR Margin shall be 1.375% per annum.
Commencing on such Adjustment Date, the applicable LIBOR Margin shall be for
each Calculation Period the applicable per annum percentage set forth in the
pricing table below opposite the applicable Total Leverage Ratio of the
Borrower, determined on a consolidated basis for the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries; provided,
that
effective (i) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and notice from the
Administrative Agent or Requisite Lenders and until such Event of Default is
cured or waived or (ii) in the event that the Administrative Agent shall not
receive the financial statements and Compliance Certificate required pursuant
to
Subsections
4.2(A),
4.2(B)
and
4.2(C)
when
due, from such due date and until the Business Day following the Administrative
Agent’s receipt of such overdue financial statements and Compliance Certificate,
the applicable LIBOR Rate Margin shall be 1.625% per annum.

(C) Interest
Periods.
Each
LIBOR Loan may be obtained for a one, two, three or six month period, or such
longer period as may be agreed by all of the Lenders (each such period being
an
“Interest
Period”).
With
respect to all LIBOR Loans:



(i) the
Interest Period will commence on the date that the LIBOR Loan is made or the
date on which any portion of any Base Rate Loan is converted into a LIBOR Loan,
or, in the case of immediately successive Interest Periods, each successive
Interest Period shall commence on the day on which the immediately preceding
Interest Period expires;



(ii) if
the
Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day,
then
it will expire on the next Business Day; provided,
that if
any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business
Day
and such day is a day of a calendar month after which no further Business Day
occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the Business Day
next
preceding such day;

Credit
Agreement/Citizens Communications Company










(iii) any
Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month or
on a
day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the last calendar
month in such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of the last
calendar month in such Interest Period; and



(iv) no
Interest Period shall be selected under the Term Loan Facility if, in order
to
make scheduled repayments of such Term Loan required pursuant to Subsection
1.6(B),
repayment of all or any portion of the LIBOR Loan prior to the expiration of
such Interest Period would be necessary.



(D) Calculation
and Payment.
Interest
on Base Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-6-day year for
the
actual number of days elapsed. Interest on LIBOR Loans and all other
Obligations, including amounts due under Subsection
1.4,
shall
be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days
elapsed. The date of funding or conversion to a Base Rate Loan and the first
day
of an Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Loan shall be included in the
calculation of interest. The date of payment of any Loan and the last day of
an
Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Loan shall be excluded from the
calculation of interest; provided,
if a
Loan is repaid on the same day that it is made, one day’s interest shall be
charged.



Interest
accruing on Base Rate Loans is payable in arrears on each of the following
dates
or events: (i) the last day of each calendar quarter; (ii) the prepayment of
such Loan (or portion thereof), to the extent accrued on the principal prepaid;
and (iii) the Term Loan Maturity Date, whether by acceleration or otherwise,
with respect to the principal to be repaid. Interest accruing on each LIBOR
Loan
is payable in arrears on each of the following dates or events: (i) the last
day
of each applicable Interest Period; (ii) if the Interest Period is longer than
three months, on each three-month anniversary of the commencement date of such
Interest Period; (iii) the prepayment of such Loan (or portion thereof), to
the
extent accrued on the principal prepaid; and (iv) the Term Loan Maturity Date,
whether by acceleration or otherwise, with respect to the principal to be
repaid.



(E) Default
Rate of Interest.
At the
election of the Administrative Agent or the Requisite Lenders, after the
occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to either Subsection
6.1(A)
or
6.1(C)
and for
so long as it continues, all Loans and other Obligations shall bear interest
at
rates that are 2.00% in excess of the rates otherwise in effect (after giving
effect to the proviso in the second sentence of Subsection
1.2(B))
with
respect to such Loans and other Obligations.



(F) Excess
Interest.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the aggregate
interest, fees and other amounts required to be paid by the Borrower to the
Lenders or any Lender hereunder are hereby expressly limited so that in no
contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration or maturity
of the Indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or
agreed to be paid to the Lenders or any Lender for the use or the forbearance
of
the Indebtedness or Obligations evidenced hereby exceed the maximum permissible
under Applicable Law. If under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment
of any provision hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents at the time of
performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the limit
of
such validity prescribed by Applicable Law then the obligation to be fulfilled
shall automatically be reduced to the limit of such validity and if under or
from circumstances whatsoever the Lenders or any Lender should ever receive
as
interest any amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, the amount
of
such interest that is excessive shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal balance of the Obligations evidenced hereby and not to the payment
of
interest. Additionally, should the method used for calculating interest (i.e.,
using a 360-day year) be unlawful, such calculation method shall be
automatically changed to a 365/6-day year or such other lawful calculation
method as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. This provision
shall control every other provision of this Agreement and all provisions of
every other Loan Document.

(G) Selection,
Conversion or Continuation of Loans; LIBOR Availability.
The
Borrower shall have the option to (i) select all or any part of a new borrowing
under the Term Loan Facility to be a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan, in the
case
of a Base Rate Loan in a principal amount equal to at least $250,000 and any
whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and in the case of a LIBOR Loan
in
a principal amount equal to $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof, (ii) convert at any time all or any portion of any Base
Rate Loan(s) in a principal amount equal to $1,000,000 or any whole multiple
of
$500,000 in excess thereof into a LIBOR Loan, (iii) upon the expiration of
its Interest Period, convert all or any part of any LIBOR Loan into a Base
Rate
Loan, and (iv) upon the expiration of its Interest Period, continue any
LIBOR Loan in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $500,000
in excess thereof into one or more LIBOR Loans, for such new Interest Period(s)
as selected by the Borrower. During any period in which any Event of Default
is
continuing, as the Interest Periods for LIBOR Loans then in effect expire,
such
Loans shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan and the LIBOR option will not
be
available to the Borrower until all Events of Default are cured or waived.
In
the event the Borrower fails to elect a LIBOR Loan upon any advance hereunder
or
upon the termination of any Interest Period, the Borrower shall be deemed to
have elected to have such amount constitute a Base Rate Loan. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, there may be no more than an aggregate of five LIBOR or Base
Rate
Loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility at any one time.



1.3 Notice
of Borrowing, Conversion or Continuation
of Loans.
Whenever
the Borrower desires to request the Term Loan pursuant to Subsection 1.1
or to
convert or continue Loans pursuant to Subsection 1.2(G),
the
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable prior written notice
in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit
1.3
(a
“Notice
of Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation”),
(i)
if requesting a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of a Base Rate
Loan
(or any portion thereof), not later than 11:00 a.m. (Denver, Colorado time),
one
Business Day before the proposed borrowing, conversion or continuation is to
be
effective or (ii), if requesting a borrowing of, a conversion to or a
continuation of a LIBOR Loan, not later than 11:00 a.m. (Denver, Colorado time),
three Business Days before the proposed borrowing, conversion or continuation
is
to be effective. Each Notice of Borrowing/Conversion/Continuation shall specify
(a) the Loan (or portion thereof) to be advanced, converted or continued and,
with respect to any LIBOR Loan to be converted or continued, the last day of
the
current Interest Period therefor, (b) the effective date of such borrowing,
conversion or continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (c) the
principal amount of such Loan to be borrowed, converted or continued and (d)
the
Interest Period to be applicable to any new LIBOR Loan. In the event the
Borrower fails to elect a LIBOR Loan upon any advance hereunder or upon the
termination of any Interest Period, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected
to have such amount constitute a portion of the Base Rate Loan under the Term
Loan Facility.

1.4 Fees
and Expenses.



(A) Loan
Commitment Fees.
From
and including the Closing Date through and excluding the last day of the
Availability Period, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for
the
benefit of all the Lenders (based upon their respective Pro Rata Shares of
the
Term Loan Commitment), a fee (the “Term
Loan Commitment Fee”)
in an
amount equal to the Term Loan Commitment multiplied by
0.25%
per annum, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number
of
days elapsed. Such fees are to be paid in arrears on the last day of the of
the
Availability Period.



(B) Certain
Other Fees.
The
Borrower shall pay the fees specified in that certain letter agreement, dated
October 23, 2006, between the Borrower and the Lead Arranger, at such times
and
to such entities as specified in such letter agreement.



(C) Breakage
Fees.
Upon
any repayment or payment of a LIBOR Loan on any day that is not the last day
of
the Interest Period applicable thereto (regardless of the source of such
repayment or prepayment and whether voluntary, mandatory, by acceleration or
otherwise), the Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent, for the benefit
of
all affected Lenders, an amount (the “Breakage
Fee”)
equal
to the amount of any losses, reasonable expenses and liabilities (including
any
loss (including interest paid) sustained by each such affected Lender in
connection with the re-employment of such funds) that each such affected Lender
may sustain as a result of the payment of such LIBOR Loan on such day. For
purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Subsection
1.4(C),
each
LIBOR Loan made by a Lender (and each related reserve, special deposit or
similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the
LIBOR rate for such LIBOR Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in
the
interbank eurocurrency market for a comparable amount and for a comparable
period, whether or not such LIBOR Loan is in fact so funded. In addition, upon
any repayment or prepayment of a LIBOR Loan on any day that is not the last
day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto (regardless of the source of such
repayment or prepayment and whether voluntary, mandatory, by acceleration or
otherwise), the Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent, individually and
not for the benefit of the Lenders, an administrative fee of $300.



(D) Expenses
and Attorneys Fees.
In
addition to fees due under Subsections
1.4 (A)
and 1.4(B),
the
Borrower agrees to pay promptly all reasonable fees, costs and expenses
(including those of attorneys) incurred by the Administrative Agent or the
Lead
Arranger in connection with (i) the syndication of the credit facility contained
herein and the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the other
Loan
Documents and (ii) in the case of the Administrative Agent only, the
continued administration of the Loan Documents, including any such reasonable
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with any amendments,
supplements, modifications and waivers of any Loan Document. In addition to
fees
due under Subsections 1.4(A)
and
1.4(B),
the
Borrower agrees to pay promptly all reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses (including those of attorneys, provided that the Borrower shall only
be
obligated to reimburse for one set of attorneys for the Administrative Agent
and
the Lenders unless the Administrative Agent or any Lender reasonably determines
that due to a conflict or otherwise its interests are better represented by
separate counsel) incurred by each of the Administrative Agent and
the
Lenders  in
connection with any Default or Event of Default and any enforcement of
collection proceeding resulting therefrom or any workout or restructuring of
any

preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver
or
any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law

All
repayments of the Term Loan pursuant to this Subsection
1.6(B)
shall be
applied in accordance with Subsection
1.8,
and
shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid and any applicable
Breakage Fees and any other fees required pursuant to Subsection
1.4(C).



1.7 Voluntary
Prepayments.
Subject
to the provisions of Subsection
1.8,
at any
time, with one day’s notice, the Borrower may prepay the Base Rate Loans, in
whole or in part, without penalty. Subject to the provisions of Subsection 1.8,
payment
of the Breakage Fees and any other fees required pursuant to Subsection
1.4(C)
and the
notice requirement in the following sentence, at any time the Borrower may
prepay any LIBOR Loan, in whole or in part. Notice of any prepayment of a LIBOR
Loan shall be given not later than 11:00 a.m. (Denver, Colorado time) on
the third Business Day preceding the date of prepayment. All prepayments shall
be in a minimum amount of at least $1,000,000, or any whole multiple of $500,000
in excess thereof, shall be applied as to each Lender based upon its Pro Rata
Share, and shall be paid and applied in accordance with Subsection

All
prepayment notices shall be irrevocable. All prepayments shall be accompanied
by
accrued interest on the amount prepaid and the Breakage Fees and any other
fees
required pursuant to Subsection

1.8 Application

first be applied to such Base Rate Loans and such LIBOR Loans as the Borrower
shall direct in writing and, in the absence of such direction, shall first
be
applied to such Base Rate Loans, and then after payment in full of all Base
Rate
Loans to such LIBOR Loans, as in each case the Administrative Agent shall
select. All prepayments and repayments required or permitted hereunder shall
be
accompanied by payment of all applicable Breakage Fees and other fees required
pursuant to Subsection
1.4(C)
and all
accrued interest on the amount prepaid or repaid. All prepayments applied to
the

1.9 Loan
Accounts.
The
Administrative Agent will maintain loan account records for (i) all Loans,
interest charges and payments thereof, (ii) the charging and payment of all
fees, costs and expenses and (iii) all other debits and credits pursuant to
this Agreement. The balance in the loan accounts shall be presumptive evidence
of the amounts due and owing to the Lenders, absent manifest error, provided
that any
failure by the Administrative Agent to maintain such records shall not limit
or
affect the Borrower’s obligation to pay.



1.10 Changes
in LIBOR Rate
Availability.



(A) In
the
event that, prior to the first day of any Interest Period (a) the Administrative
Agent shall have determined that, by reason of circumstances generally affecting
the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
LIBOR for such Interest Period, or (b) the Requisite Lenders determine (and
notify the Administrative Agent) that LIBOR applicable pursuant to Subsection
1.2(A)(i)
for any
requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan under the Term
Loan Facility does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders
of
funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof
to the Borrower and the Lenders. If such notice is given, (i) any LIBOR
Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall accrue
interest at the Base Rate, (ii) Loans that were to have been converted on the
first day of such Interest Period to LIBOR Loans shall be continued as Base
Rate
Loans, and (iii) any outstanding LIBOR Loans shall be converted, on the last
day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, to Base Rate Loans. Until such notice
has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further LIBOR Loans shall
be
made or construed as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert
Base
Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans.



(B) If
the
introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether
or
not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank
or
comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for one or more of
the
Lenders to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan,
such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent,
and
the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower
and
all other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of such
Lender or Lenders to make LIBOR Loans and the right of the Borrower to convert
any Loan or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Loan shall be suspended with respect
to
the affected Lenders and (ii) if any Lender may not lawfully continue to
maintain a LIBOR Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable
thereto, the portion of the Loan held by the affected Lenders shall immediately
be converted to a Base Rate Loan.



1.11 Capital
Adequacy and Other Adjustments.



(A) If
the
introduction of or the interpretation of any law, rule, or regulation would
increase the reserve requirement or otherwise increase the cost to any Lender
of
making or maintaining a LIBOR Loan in an amount deemed by such Lender to be
material, then such Lender shall submit a certificate to the Borrower setting
forth the amount and demonstrating the calculation of such increased cost to
such Lender. The Borrower shall be obligated to pay the amount of such increased
cost to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the affected Lender within
15 days after receipt of such certificate. Such certificate shall, absent
manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. There is
no
limitation on the number of times such a certificate may be
submitted.

(B) In
the
event that any Lender shall have determined that the adoption after the date
hereof of any law, treaty, governmental (or quasi-governmental) rule,
regulation, guideline or order regarding capital adequacy, reserve requirements
or similar requirements or compliance by any Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy, reserve requirements or similar requirements (whether or not having
the force of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would be
unlawful) from any central bank or governmental agency or body having
jurisdiction does or shall have the effect of increasing the amount of capital,
reserves or other funds required to be maintained by such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender and thereby reducing the rate of return
on
such Lender’s or such corporation’s capital as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder in an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then the Borrower
shall be obligated to, from time to time within 15 days after notice and demand
from such Lender (together with the certificate referred to in the next sentence
and with a copy to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such
Lender for such reduction. A certificate as to the amount of such cost and
showing the basis of the computation of such cost submitted by such Lender
to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall, absent manifest error, be
final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. There is no limitation on the
number of times such a certificate may be submitted.



(C) Failure
or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any increased
costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return
on
capital shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such
compensation; provided
that the
Borrower shall not be under any obligation to compensate any Lender under
Subsections
1.11(A)
or
1.11(B)
with
respect to increased costs or reductions with respect to any period prior to
the
date that is 120 days prior to such request if such Lender knew or could
reasonably have been expected to know of the circumstances giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of the fact that such circumstances would
result in a claim for increased compensation by reason of such increased costs
or reductions; provided further
that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply to any increased costs or reductions
arising out of the retroactive application of any change in any law, rule,
regulation, treaty or directive or in the interpretation thereof within such
120-day period. A Lender shall seek compensation for any increased costs or
reduction under Subsections
1.11(A)
or
1.11(B)
only if
such Lender is also seeking such increased costs or reductions from similarly
situated borrowers of such Lender.



(D) If
(i) any Lender shall request compensation under this Subsection
1.11,
(ii) any Lender delivers a notice described in Subsection
1.14
or
(iii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender
or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender, pursuant to Subsection
1.13,
then
such Lender shall use reasonable efforts (which shall not require such Lender
to
incur an unreimbursed loss or unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise take
any
action inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory
restrictions or suffer any disadvantage or burden deemed by it to be
significant) (x) to file any certificate or document reasonably requested
in writing by the Borrower or (y) to assign its rights and delegate and
transfer its obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if such filing or assignment would reduce its claims for
compensation under Subsection
1.11
or
enable it to withdraw its notice pursuant to Subsection
1.14
or would
reduce amounts payable pursuant to Subsection
1.13,
as the
case may be, in the future. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such filing
or
assignment, delegation and transfer.

1.12 Optional
Prepayment/Replacement of Lender in
Respect of Increased Costs.
Within
15 days after receipt by the Borrower of written notice and demand from any
Lender (an “Affected
Lender”)
for
payment of additional costs as provided in Subsections
1.11
or
1.14
or if it
becomes illegal or impossible for any Lender to continue to fund or to make
LIBOR Loans pursuant to Subsection
1.10(B),
as a
result of any condition described in either of such Subsections, then, unless
such Lender has theretofore removed or cured the conditions creating the cause
for such obligation to pay such additional amounts or for such illegality or
impossibility, the Borrower may, at its option, notify the Administrative Agent
and such Affected Lender of its intention to do one of the
following:



(1) The
Borrower may obtain, at the Borrower’s expense, a replacement Lender
(“Replacement
Lender”)
for
such Affected Lender, which Replacement Lender shall be reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent. In the event the Borrower obtains a Replacement
Lender within 120 days following notice of its intention to do so, the Affected
Lender shall sell and assign its Loans and its obligations under the Term Loan
Commitment to such Replacement Lender in an amount equal to the sum of the
principal of and interest accrued to the date of such sale and assignment on
the
outstanding Loans of such Affected Lender, provided that the Borrower has
reimbursed such Affected Lender for its increased costs for which it is entitled
to reimbursement under this Agreement through the date of such sale and
assignment; or



(2) The
Borrower may prepay in full all outstanding Obligations owed to such Affected
Lender and terminate such Affected Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan
Commitment, in which case the Term Loan Commitment will be permanently reduced
by the amount of such Pro Rata Share. The Borrower shall, within 120 days
following notice of its intention to do so, prepay in full all outstanding
Obligations owed to such Affected Lender (including all applicable Breakage
Fees
and such Affected Lender’s increased costs for which it is entitled to
reimbursement under this Agreement through the date of such prepayment), and
terminate such Affected Lender’s obligations under the Term Loan Commitment, and
upon such prepayment each scheduled repayment of the Term Loan pursuant to
Subsection
1.6(B)
shall be
reduced on a proportional basis.



1.13 Taxes.



(A) No
Deductions.
Any and
all payments or reimbursements made hereunder or under the Notes shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding,
however,
any
tax, levy, impost, deduction, charge or withholding, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, with respect to any Foreign Lender as defined below, and any
tax imposed on the revenues, income or net income of a Lender or the
Administrative Agent by its jurisdiction of incorporation or by the federal,
state, local or foreign taxing authorities in the jurisdiction in which the
principal place of business of such Lender or the Administrative Agent is
located or by any jurisdiction or taxing authority thereof or therein, with
which such Lender or the Administrative Agent has or had a connection (other
than a connection arising solely as a result of such Lender or the
Administrative Agent having executed, delivered or performed its obligations
or
received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document) (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, collectively,
“Tax
Liabilities”).
If
the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Tax Liabilities from or
in
respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent,
then the sum payable hereunder shall be increased as may be necessary so that,
after making all required deductions, such Lender or the Administrative Agent
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made; provided,
however,
that
the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to
any
Lender or the Administrative Agent with respect to (i) any withholding tax
that
is imposed or amounts payable to any Lender or the Administrative Agent at
the
time such Lender or Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement
(or
designates a new lending office) or (ii) any Tax Liabilities that are
attributable to such Lender’s or the Administrative Agent’s failure to comply
with the requirements of Subsections
1.13(B)
or
1.13(C).

(B) Foreign
Lenders.
Each
Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States
(“Foreign
Lender”)
as to
which payments made under this Agreement or under the Notes are exempt from
United States withholding tax or are subject to United States withholding tax
at
a reduced rate under an applicable statute or tax treaty shall provide to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly upon becoming a Lender under
this
Agreement or when such Lender designates a new lending office a properly
completed and executed United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
other applicable form, certificate or document prescribed by the Internal
Revenue Service of the United States certifying as to such Foreign Lender’s
entitlement to such exemption or reduced rate of withholding with respect to
payments to be made to such Foreign Lender under this Agreement and under the
Notes or Form W-8ECI or other applicable form, certificate or document
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying
that
payments made to such Foreign Lender are not subject to withholding because
they
are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (a “Certificate
of Exemption”).



If
a
Foreign Lender is entitled to an exemption with respect to payments to be made
to such Foreign Lender under this Agreement or the Notes (or to a reduced rate
of withholding) and does not provide a Certificate of Exemption to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent within the time periods set forth in the preceding
paragraph, the Borrower shall withhold taxes from payments to such Foreign
Lender at the applicable statutory rates and the Borrower shall not be required
to pay any additional amounts as a result of such withholding, provided
that all
such withholding shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, cease or
be
reduced, as appropriate, upon delivery by such Foreign Lender of a Certificate
of Exemption to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.



(C) Non-U.S.
Withholding Taxes.
A Lender
that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding
tax
under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any
treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under
this Agreement or under the Notes shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy
to
the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law
or
reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed
documentation that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and
deliver and is prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such payments to
be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

Table

Credit
Agreement/Citizens Communications Company








If
a
Lender is entitled to an exemption with respect to payments to be made to such
Lender under this Agreement or the Notes (or to a reduced rate of withholding)
and does not provide such documentation to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent within the time periods set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Borrower
shall withhold taxes from payments to such Lender at the applicable statutory
rates and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts
as a
result of such withholding, provided that all such withholding shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, cease or be reduced, as appropriate, upon
delivery by such Lender of such documentation to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.



(D) Participations.
Each
Lender that sells or grants a participation shall (i) withhold or deduct
from each payment to a Participant the amount of any tax required under
Applicable Law to be withheld or deducted from such payment and not withheld
or
deducted therefrom by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (ii) pay any
tax
so withheld or deducted by it to the appropriate taxing authority in accordance
with Applicable Law and (iii) indemnify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent for any losses, costs and expenses that either of them may incur as a
result of any failure to withhold or deduct and pay any tax to the extent the
amount of such tax and losses, costs and expenses exceeds the amount of tax
and
losses, costs and expenses that would have been imposed in the absence of such
participation.



(E) Refunds.
If the
Administrative Agent or a Lender determines that it has received a refund of
any
Tax Liabilities as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with
respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Subsection
1.13,
it
shall pay over such refund to Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this
Subsection
1.13
with
respect to the Tax Liabilities giving rise to such refund) net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided,
that
the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender,
agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to
the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or
such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
This Subsection
1.13
shall
not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make
available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which
it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.




1.14 Changes
in Laws.
In the
event that, subsequent to the Closing Date, (i) any changes in any existing
law,
regulation, treaty or directive or in the interpretation or application thereof,
(ii) any new law, regulation, treaty or directive enacted or any interpretation
or application thereof, or (iii) compliance by the Administrative Agent or
any
Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
from any Governmental Authority, does or shall impose on the Administrative
Agent or any Lender any other condition or increased cost in connection with
the
transactions contemplated hereby or participations herein and the result of
any
of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Administrative Agent or any
such
Lender of making or continuing any Loan hereunder, or to reduce any amount
receivable hereunder, as the case may be, then, in any such case, the Borrower
shall be obligated to promptly pay to the Administrative Agent or such Lender,
upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, on an after-tax basis, for such additional
cost or reduced amount receivable, as determined by the Administrative Agent
or
such Lender with respect to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. If
the
Administrative Agent or such Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional
amounts pursuant to this Subsection
1.14,
it
shall promptly notify the Borrower of the event by reason of which the
Administrative Agent or such Lender has become so entitled. A certificate as
to
any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted
by
the Administrative Agent or such Lender to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding for all
purposes. There is no limitation on the number of times such a certificate
may
be submitted; provided,
however,
that
this Subsection
1.14
shall
not apply to any changes in law with respect to taxes.

Subsidiaries to pay, before any such amounts become delinquent, (i) all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges imposed upon it or upon its property,
and
(ii) all claims (including, without limitation, claims for labor, materials,
supplies, or services) which might, if unpaid, become a Lien upon its property,
unless, in each case,
the
validity or amount thereof is being disputed in good faith, and the Borrower
has
maintained adequate reserves with respect thereto, in each case where the
failure to so pay would

permit the Administrative Agent and each Lender to visit and inspect the
financial records of the Borrower at reasonable times and as often as requested
and to make extracts from and copies
of
such financial records, and permit any representatives designated by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to discuss the affairs, finances and
condition of the Borrower with the appropriate officers thereof and, with the
Borrower’s consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), the independent
accountants therefor; provided,
however,
that
if
the Borrower shall so require, a single representative shall be appointed by
the
Requisite Lenders to exercise the rights granted to the Lenders under this
Subsection
2.2;
provided,

2.4 CoBank
Patronage Capital.
So long
as CoBank is a Lender hereunder, the Borrower will acquire non-voting
participation certificates in CoBank in such amounts and at such times as CoBank
may require in accordance with CoBank’s Bylaws and Capital Plan (as each may be
amended from time to time), except that the maximum amount of participation
certificates that the Borrower may be required to purchase in CoBank in
connection with the Loans may not exceed the maximum amount permitted by the
Bylaws and the Capital Plan at the time this Agreement is entered into. The
rights and obligations of the parties with respect to such participation
certificates and any distributions made on account thereof or on account of
the
Borrower’s patronage with CoBank shall be governed by CoBank’s Bylaws. CoBank
agrees that all Loans that are made by CoBank and that are retained for its
own
account and not sold in a participation (except to a participant that makes
patronage distributions to CoBank) shall be entitled to patronage distributions
in accordance with CoBank’s Bylaws; all Loans that are made by CoBank and are
included in a sale of a participation (except to a participant that makes
patronage distributions to CoBank) shall not be entitled to patronage
distributions. CoBank’s Pro Rata Share of the Loans and other Obligations due to
CoBank shall be secured by a statutory first lien on all equity which the
Borrower may now own or hereafter acquire in CoBank. Such equity shall not,
however,
constitute security for the Obligations due to any other Lender. CoBank shall
not be obligated to set off or otherwise apply such equities to the Borrower’s
obligations to CoBank. In the event of any liquidation, sale, transfer or other
disposition of collateral that includes the Borrower’s participation
certificates in CoBank, whether by foreclosure or otherwise, the proceeds
attributable to such participation certificates shall be equal to the face
value
of such participation certificates as reflected in the official records of
CoBank.

change).

Upon the

the Lenders all of their other rights and remedies under this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents and Applicable Law, in order to satisfy all of the
Obligations.



6.5 Consents.
The
Borrower acknowledges that certain transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and certain actions which may be taken by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders in the exercise of their respective rights
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may require the consent of
a
Governmental Authority. If the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that
the consent of a Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of any of the aforesaid Loan Documents
or
any Loan Documents delivered to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in
connection therewith or as a result of any action which may be taken pursuant
thereto, then the Borrower, at the Borrower’s cost and expense, agrees to use

time to time, to set off and to apply any and all (A) balances held by such
Lender at any of its offices for the account of the Borrower (regardless of
whether such balances are then due to the Borrower), and (B) other property
at
any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or for the account
of
the Borrower, against and on account of any of the Obligations; provided,
that no
Lender shall exercise any such right without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent. Any Lender exercising a right to set off shall, to the
extent the amount of any such set off exceeds its Pro Rata Share of the amount
set off, purchase for cash (and the other Lenders shall sell) interests in
each
such other Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to
cause such Lender to share such excess with each other Lender in accordance
with
their respective Pro Rata Shares. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, that any Lender may exercise its right to set off with respect
to amounts in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the Obligations and upon doing
so
shall deliver such excess to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of all
the
Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided,
that
CoBank may exercise its rights against any equity of CoBank held by the Borrower
without complying with this Subsection
6.6.



6.7 Application
of Payments.
Subsequent to the acceleration of the Term Loan pursuant to Subsection
6.3,
all
payments received by the Lenders on the Obligations and on the proceeds from
the
enforcement of the Obligations shall be applied among the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders as follows: first, to all the Administrative Agent’s and the
Lenders’ fees and expenses then due and payable; then to all other expenses then
due and payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents; then to all indemnitee
obligations then due and payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents;
then
to all accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Loan in accordance with all
such
amounts due on the Term Loan; then to the principal amount of the Term Loan;
and
then to any remaining amounts due under the Obligations, in that order
(provided, such priority may be changed with the consent of the Requisite
Lenders). Any remaining monies not applied as provided in this Subsection
6.7
shall be
paid to the Borrower or any Person lawfully entitled thereto.

6.8 Adjustments.
If any
Lender (a “Benefited
Lender”)
shall
at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest thereon
in a greater proportion than any such payment received by any other Lender
(other than pursuant to Subsection
1.12(2)),
if
any, in respect of such other Lender’s Loans, or interest thereon, such
Benefited Lender shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, purchase
for
cash from the other Lenders such portion of each such other Lender’s Loans as
shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment
or
benefits ratably with each Lender; provided,
that if
all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered
from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase
price and benefits returned to the extent of such recovery, but without
interest. The Borrower agrees that each Lender so purchasing a portion of
another Lender’s Loans may exercise all rights of payment (including rights of
set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct
holder of such portion. This Subsection 6.8
shall
not apply to any action taken by CoBank with respect to equity in it held by
the
Borrower.

with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of
such
assignment. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this Subsection
8.1(B)
shall be
treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Subsection
8.1(D).




(C) Register.
The
Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Denver, Colorado a copy of
each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Pro Rata Share
of
the Term Loan Commitment of, and principal amounts of the Term Loan owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”).
The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder
for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender,
at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

(D) Participations.
Any
Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower
or
the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a
natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”)
in all
or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan Commitment
and/or the Loans owing to it); provided
that (i)
such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent
and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.
CoBank reserves the right to assign or sell participations in all or any part
of
its Pro Rata Share of the Term Loan Commitment and the term Loan on a
non-patronage basis.




Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided
that
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in Subsection
9.2
relating
to amendments requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders that affects such
Participant. Subject to Subsection
8.1(E),
the
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Subsections
1.11,
1.13
and
1.14
to the
same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to Subsection
8.1(B).
To the
extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits
of Subsection
6.6
as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
Subsection
6.6
as
though it were a Lender.




Any
bank
that is a member of the Farm Credit System that (i) has purchased a
participation in the minimum amount of $5,000,000, (ii) if the Administrative
Agent is other than CoBank, has been designated by written notice to the
Administrative Agent as being entitled to be accorded the right of a voting
participant, and (iii) receives the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent (such consent being required only if the Administrative
Agent is other than CoBank) and of the Borrower (such consent being required
only if no Event of Default then exists and is continuing and only as to members
not a Participant as of the Closing Date) to become a voting Participant, shall
be entitled to vote, and the voting rights of the selling Lender shall be
correspondingly reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as if such participant
were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or
withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action.




(E) Limitations
upon Participant Rights.
A
Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Subsections
1.11,
1.13
and
1.14
than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation
to
such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent. A
Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be
entitled to the benefits of Subsection
1.13
unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and
such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Subsection
1.13(B)
as
though it were a Lender.

(F) Certain
Pledges.
Any
Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided
that no
such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.




8.2 Agents.



(A) Appointment.
Each
Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes CoBank, as the Administrative
Agent and as the Lead Arranger, to act as the Administrative Agent, and the
Lead
Arranger, hereunder and under any other Loan Document with such powers as are
specifically delegated to such Agent by the terms of this Agreement and any
other Loan Document, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent is authorized and empowered to
amend, modify or waive any provisions of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents on behalf of the Lenders, subject to the requirement that the consent
of certain Lenders or all Lenders, as appropriate, be obtained in certain
instances as provided in Subsections
8.3
and
9.2.
CoBank
hereby agrees to act as the Administrative Agent on the express conditions
contained in this Subsection
8.2.
The
provisions of this Subsection 8.2
are
solely for the benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall
have no rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof.
In
performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, the Agents shall
act
solely as the Administrative Agent, or the Lead Arranger, as applicable, of
the
Lenders and no Agent shall assume or be deemed to have assumed any obligation
toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for the Borrower or its
respective Affiliates. Each Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact
and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents
or
attorneys-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care.



(B) Nature
of Duties.
The
duties of the Agents shall be mechanical and administrative in nature. None
of
the Agents shall have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship
in
respect of any Lender. Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents,
express or implied, is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon the
Agents any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents
except as expressly set forth herein or therein. Each Lender expressly
acknowledges that none of the Agents nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates have made any
representation or warranty to it and that no act by any Agent or any such Person
hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall
be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that (i) it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and
based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
properties, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower
and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and extend credit to
the
Borrower hereunder, and (ii) it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information
as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action hereunder and under
the
other Loan Documents and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to
inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, properties, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. The Agents shall
have
no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide
any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto (other
than
as expressly required herein). If either Agent seeks the consent or approval
of
any Lender to the taking or refraining from taking of any action hereunder,
then
such Agent shall send notice thereof to each Lender. Each Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender any time that Requisite Lenders have instructed such Agent
to
act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

(C) Rights,
Exculpation, Etc.
Each of
the Agents, their respective Affiliates and any of their or their Affiliates’
respective officers, directors, employees, agents or attorneys-in-fact shall
not
be liable to any Lender for any action taken or omitted by them hereunder or
under any of the Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, except
that each such entity shall be liable with respect to its own gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be liable for any apportionment
or distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such
apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made
in
error, the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made
shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount
to
which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree
to
return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them). In
performing its functions and duties hereunder, each Agent shall exercise the
same care which it would in dealing with loans for its own account, but the
Agents shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties herein or for the execution, effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby,
or for the financial condition of the Borrower. Each Agent may at any time
request instructions from the Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals
which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents such Agent
is permitted or required to take or to grant, and if such instructions are
promptly requested, such Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from
taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any
liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding
any approval under any of the Loan Documents (i) if such action or omission
would, in the reasonable opinion of such Agent, violate any Applicable Law
or
any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or (ii) until it
shall have received such instructions from Requisite Lenders or all of the
Lenders, as applicable. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have
any
right of action whatsoever against either Agent as a result of such Agent acting
or refraining from acting under this Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other
Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders, except
in connection with its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct.



(D) Reliance.
Each
Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon
any written or oral notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents
or any telephone message or other communication (including any writing, telex,
telecopy or telegram) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and
to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to
all
matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and its duties
hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it in connection
with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, administration,
amendment, modification, waiver or enforcement (whether through negotiations,
legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.

(E) Indemnification.
The
Lenders will reimburse and indemnify each Agent and their respective Affiliates
and their Affiliates’ officers, directors, employees, agents, and
attorneys-in-fact (collectively, “Representatives”),
on
demand (to the extent not actually reimbursed under Subsection
9.1,
but
without limiting the obligations of the Borrower under such Subsection
9.1)
for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys’ fees and expenses), advances or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any Agent
or their respective Representatives (i) in any way relating to or arising out
of
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted
by
such Agent or its Representatives under this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents, and (ii) in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution,
delivery, administration, amendment, modification, waiver or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any
of
the other Loan Documents in proportion to each Lender’s Pro Rata Share;
provided,
that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or
disbursements resulting from such Agent’s or its Representatives’ gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. If any indemnity furnished to
any
Agent or their respective Representatives for any purpose shall, in the opinion
of such Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such Agent may call for
additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified
against until such additional indemnity is furnished. The obligations of the
Lenders under this Subsection
8.2(E)
shall
survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.



(F) The
Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger Individually.
With
respect to its obligations under the Term Loan Commitment, the Loans made by
it,
and the Notes issued to it, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arranger shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and
is
subject to the same obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth
herein for any other Lender. The terms “Lenders”
or
“Requisite
Lenders”
or
any
similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include
each of the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger, in its individual
capacity as a Lender or as one of the Requisite Lenders. Each of the
Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger may lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with, the Borrower as
if
it were not acting as an Agent pursuant hereto.



(G) Notice
of Default.
No Agent
shall be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement
or
any of the Loan Documents or the financial condition of the Borrower or any
of
its Subsidiaries, or the existence or possible existence of any Default or
Event
of Default. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless such Agent shall have
received written notice from the Borrower or a Lender referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a “notice of default.” In the event that an Agent receives such a
notice, such Agent will give notice thereof to the Lenders as soon as reasonably
practicable; provided,
that if
any such notice has also been furnished to the Lenders, such Agent shall have
no
obligation to notify the Lenders with respect thereto. The Agents shall (subject
to this Subsection
8.2)
take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably
be directed by Requisite Lenders; provided,
further,
that,
unless and until the Agents shall have received such directions, the Agents
may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as they shall deem
advisable and in the best interests of the Lenders.

(H) Successor
Agents.



(1) Resignation.
Any
Agent may resign from the performance of all its agency functions and duties
hereunder at any time by giving at least 30 Business Days’ prior written notice
to the Borrower and the Lenders. Such resignation shall take effect upon the
acceptance by a successor Agent of appointment pursuant to clause (2) below
or
as otherwise provided below.



(2) Appointment
of Successor.
Upon
any such notice of resignation pursuant to clause (1) above, Requisite Lenders
shall (and if no Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, upon receipt of the Borrower’s prior consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), appoint a successor Agent from among the Lenders or
another financial institution. If a successor Agent shall not have been so
appointed within the 30 Business Day period referred to in Subsection
8(H)(1),
the
retiring Agent, upon notice to the Borrower, shall then appoint a successor
Agent from among the Lenders who shall serve as Agent until such time, if any,
as Requisite Lenders, upon receipt of the Borrower’s prior written consent (if
required under the first sentence of this paragraph), which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, appoint a successor Agent as provided above.



(3) Successor
Agent.
Upon
the acceptance of any appointment as Agent under the Loan Documents by a
successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
under
the Loan Documents. After any retiring Agent’s resignation as Agent under the
Loan Documents, the provisions of this Subsection
8.2
shall
inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent under the Loan Documents.



8.3 Amendments,
Consents and Waivers for Certain
Actions.



(1) Except
as
otherwise provided in this Agreement (including this Subsection 8.3
and
Subsection
9.2)
or any
other Loan Document, the consent of Requisite Lenders and the Borrower will
be
required to amend, modify, terminate, or waive any provision of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents.



(2) In
the
event either Agent requests the consent of a Lender and does not receive a
written consent or denial thereof within ten Business Days after such Lender’s
receipt of such request, then such Lender will be deemed to have denied the
giving of such consent.

8.4 Disbursement
of Funds.
The
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender by telephone or telecopy of the
amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Loan requested by the Borrower no
later than 11:00 a.m. (Denver, Colorado time) at least two Business Days
immediately preceding the Funding Date applicable thereto (in the case of LIBOR
Loans), otherwise on the Business Day immediately preceding the Funding Date
applicable thereto, and each such Lender shall pay the Administrative Agent
such
Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such requested Loan, in same day funds, by wire
transfer to the Administrative Agent’s account by no later than 1:00 p.m.
(Denver, Colorado time) on such Funding Date. If any Lender fails to pay the
amount of its Pro Rata Share forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower, and the
Administrative Agent shall disburse to the Borrower, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, that portion of such Loan as to which the
Administrative Agent has received funds. In such event, the Administrative
Agent
may, on behalf of any Lender not timely paying the Administrative Agent,
disburse funds to the Borrower for Loans requested, subject to the provisions
of
Subsection
8.5(B).
Each
such Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent on demand for all funds
disbursed on its behalf by the Administrative Agent. Nothing in this
Subsection
8.4
or
elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, including the
provisions of Subsection
8.5,
shall
be deemed to require the Administrative Agent (or any other Lender) to advance
funds on behalf of any Lender or to relieve any Lender from its obligation
to
fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result
of
any default by such Lender hereunder.



8.5 Disbursements
of Advances; Payments.



(A) Pro
Rata Treatment; Application.
Upon
receipt by the Administrative Agent of each payment from the Borrower hereunder,
other than as described in the succeeding sentence, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly credit each Lender’s account with its Pro Rata Share of such
payment in accordance with such Lender’s Pro Rata Share and shall promptly wire
advice of the amount of such credit to each Lender. Each payment to the
Administrative Agent of its fees shall be made in like manner, but for the
account of the Administrative Agent.



(B) Availability
of Lender’s Pro Rata Share.



(1) Unless
the Administrative Agent has been notified by a Lender prior to a Funding Date
of such Lender’s intention not to fund its Pro Rata Share of the Loan amount
requested by the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent has given notice
pursuant to Subsection
8.4,
the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender will make such amount available
to the Administrative Agent on the Funding Date. If such amount is not, in
fact,
made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender when due, and the
Administrative Agent disburses funds to the Borrower on behalf of such Lender,
such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay such amount to the
Administrative Agent, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind,
with interest thereon at the rate per annum then applicable to such
Loan.

(2) Nothing
contained in this Subsection
8.5(B)
will be
deemed to relieve a Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments or
to
prejudice any rights the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against
such Lender as a result of a default by such Lender under this
Agreement.



(C) Return
of Payments.



(1) If
the
Administrative Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the
belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by
the
Administrative Agent from the Borrower and such related payment is not received
by the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent will be entitled
to
recover such amount from such Lender without set-off, counterclaim or deduction
of any kind.



(2) If
the
Administrative Agent determines at any time that any amount received by the
Administrative Agent under this Agreement must be returned to the Borrower
or
paid to any other Person pursuant to any solvency law or otherwise, then,
notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof
to
any Lender. In addition, each Lender will repay to the Administrative Agent
on
demand any portion of such amount that the Administrative Agent has distributed
to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as the
Administrative Agent is required to pay to the Borrower or such other Person,
without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.

Agent to take additional collateral pursuant to any Loan Document. No amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of any Note shall be
effective without the written concurrence of the holder of that Note. No notice
to or demand on the Borrower or any other Person in any case shall entitle
the
Borrower or such Person to any other or further notice or demand in similar

No
failure or delay on the part of any Agent or any Lender to exercise, nor any
partial exercise of, any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other

in
any jurisdiction in which it is not invalid, unenforceable or

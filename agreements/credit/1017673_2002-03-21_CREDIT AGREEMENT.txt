accordance with Section 2.16.  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from
a Bank prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make
available to the Agent such Bank's portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may
assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date
of such Borrowing in accordance with this paragraph (a) and the Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have made
such portion available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree
to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available
to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent at (i) in the
case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans
comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate; provided, that if such Bank shall not pay such amount within
three Business Days of the date of such Borrowing, such overdue amount shall,
at

22
<PAGE>

the expiration of such three-Business Day period, bear interest at the Base
Rate Option. If such Bank repays to the Agent such corresponding amount, such
amount shall constitute such Bank's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes
of this Agreement.

(b)  The Borrower may refinance all or any part of any Borrowing
with any other Borrowing subject to the conditions and limitations set forth
herein and elsewhere in this Agreement. Any Borrowing or part thereof so
refinanced shall be deemed to be repaid in accordance with Section 2.3 or  2.7
with the proceeds of a new Borrowing hereunder and the proceeds of the new
Borrowing, to the extent they do not exceed the principal amount of the
Borrowing being refinanced, shall not be paid by the Banks to the Agent or by
the Agent to the Borrower; provided, however, that (i) if the principal amount
extended by a Bank in a refinancing is greater than the principal amount that
was extended by such Bank in the Borrowing being refinanced, then such Bank
shall pay such difference to the Agent for distribution to the Banks described
in (ii) below, (ii) if the principal amount extended by a Bank in the Borrowing
being refinanced is greater than the principal amount agreed to be extended by
such Bank in the refinancing, the Agent shall return the difference to such
Bank out of amounts received pursuant to (i) above, and (iii) to the extent any
Bank fails to pay the Agent amounts due from it pursuant to (i) above, any Loan
or portion thereof being refinanced with such amounts shall not be deemed
repaid in accordance with Section 2.3 or 2.7 and shall be payable by the
Borrower without prejudice to the Borrower's rights against any such Bank.

(c)  Each Bank may at its option fulfill its Commitment
hereunder with respect to any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or
foreign branch or Affiliate of such Bank to make such Loan; provided, however,
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and
the applicable Note.

(d)  All Borrowings, conversions and continuations of Revolving
Credit Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall
be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections that, after giving
effect thereto, (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising each
Tranche of Eurodollar Loans shall be equal to $500,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof and (B) the Borrower shall not have outstanding at
any one time more than in the aggregate eight (8) separate Tranches of Loans
(including the Base Rate Tranche).

(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing if the Interest Period
requested with respect thereto would end after the Termination Date.

2.5  Letters of Credit.

(a)  L/C Commitment. (i) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Issuing Bank, in reliance on the agreements of the other Banks set
forth in Section 2.5(d), agrees to issue letters of credit (together with the
Existing Letters of Credit, collectively referred to as the "Letters of
Credit") for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day during the

23
<PAGE>

Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by the
Issuing Bank; provided, that no Letter of Credit shall be issued if, after
giving effect thereto (A) the amount of the Total Exposure would exceed the
amount of the Total Commitment in effect at such time (B) the aggregate amount
of the L/C Obligations at such time would exceed the L/C Commitment in effect
at such time or (C) a Default or Event of Default shall exist or be continuing.

(ii)  Each Letter of Credit:

(A) shall be denominated in Dollars and shall be a
standby letter of credit; and

(B) shall be for the account of the Borrower and for
the benefit of the Borrower and/or one or more of the Guarantors;

(C) shall have an expiration date no later than the
Termination Date; and

(D) may during the Commitment Period be extended at
the sole discretion of the Issuing Bank for additional periods of up to
one year each (but in no event to expire later than the Termination Date)
upon written request from the Borrower to the Issuing Bank at least 20
days (or such other time period as agreed by the Borrower and the Agent)
before the date upon which notice of extension is otherwise required by
the terms thereof.

(iii) Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to ISP98 and,
to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of Delaware.

(b)  Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower
may from time to time request that the Issuing Bank issue a Letter of Credit by
delivering to the Issuing Bank at its office for notices specified herein an
Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Bank, and
such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the
Issuing Bank may reasonably request. Upon receipt by the Issuing Bank of any
Application, the Issuing Bank will process such Application and the
certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in
connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall,
after determining from the Agent that issuance of the Letter of Credit
requested thereby will be within the limits imposed by Section 2.5(a)(i), issue
such Letter of Credit not later than ten (10) Business Days after its receipt
of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and
other papers and information relating thereto (but in no event shall the
Issuing Bank be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than five (5)
Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other
certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by
issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as
otherwise may be agreed by the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. The Issuing Bank
shall promptly after issuing a Letter of Credit furnish copies thereof to the
Borrower.

24
<PAGE>

(c)  L/C Fees, Commissions and Other Charges.(i) The Borrower
shall pay to the Agent, for the account of the Banks (including the Issuing
Bank) pro rata according to their respective Commitment Percentages, a letter
of credit fee with respect to the aggregate face amount of all Letters of
Credit outstanding, computed at the rate equal to the Applicable Margin for
LIBOR Loans in effect from time to time (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days each Letter of Credit is outstanding in a year of 360 days). The
Borrower shall also pay to the Issuing Bank, in respect of each Letter of
Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, a fronting fee in an amount not to exceed
$250. The fees described in the preceding sentences shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on each L/C Payment Date and on the Termination Date or
such earlier date as the Commitments are terminated, and shall be nonrefundable.

(ii)  In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall
pay or reimburse the Issuing Bank for such normal and customary costs and
expenses as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Bank in issuing, effecting
payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit, in
accordance with the schedule of such costs attached hereto as Schedule V.

(iii) The Agent shall, promptly following its receipt
thereof, distribute to the Issuing Bank and the Banks all fees and commissions
received by the Agent for their respective accounts pursuant to this subsection.


(d)  L/C Participations. (i) The Issuing Bank irrevocably agrees
to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing
Bank to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably
agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing
Bank, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C
Participant's own account and risk, an undivided interest equal to such L/C
Participant's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage in the Issuing Bank's
obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank
hereunder and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Bank thereunder.
Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing
Bank that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing
Bank for which the Issuing Bank is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to
the Issuing Bank upon demand at the Issuing Bank's address for notices
specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving Credit
Commitment Percentage of the amount of such draft or any part thereof, which is
not so reimbursed. Any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank under or in
connection with a Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct, shall neither create for the Issuing Bank any
resulting liability to any L/C Participant nor constitute a defense to an L/C
Participant's obligation to make the payments to the Issuing Bank required by
the immediately preceding sentence.

(ii)  If any amount required to be paid by any L/C
Participant to the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.5(d) in respect of any
unreimbursed portion of any

25
<PAGE>

payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit is not paid to the
Issuing Bank on the date such payment is due from such L/C Participant, such
L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Bank on demand an amount equal to the
product of (A) such amount, times (B) the daily average Federal Funds Effective
Rate, as quoted by the Issuing Bank, during the period from and including the
date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately
available to the Issuing Bank, times (C) a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which
is 360. A certificate of the Issuing Bank submitted to any L/C Participant with
respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

(iii) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Bank has made
payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant
its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 2.5(d)(i), the
Issuing Bank receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether
directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including by way of set-off or
proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Bank), or any payment of
interest on account thereof, the Issuing Bank will distribute to such L/C
Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, however, that in the event
that any such payment received by the Issuing Bank shall be required to be
returned by the Issuing Bank, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing
Bank the portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Bank to it.

(e)  Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. (i) The Borrower
agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank in respect of a Letter of Credit on each
date on which the Issuing Bank notifies the Borrower of the date and amount of
a draft presented under such Letter of Credit and paid or to be paid by the
Issuing Bank for the amount of (A) such draft so paid and (B) any taxes, fees,
charges or other direct out of pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing
Bank in connection with such payment. Each such payment shall be made to the
Issuing Bank at its office listed in Section 9.2 in Dollars and in immediately
available funds.

(ii)  Interest shall be payable on any and all amounts
remaining unpaid by the Borrower under this subsection from the date such
amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) until payment in full at the per annum rate of the Base Rate Option
plus 2.0% and shall be payable on demand by the Issuing Bank.

(f)  Obligations Absolute. (i) The obligations of the Borrower
under this Section 2.5 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to
payment which the Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Bank or any
beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person.

(ii)  The Borrower agrees with the Issuing Bank that the
Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement
Obligations under

26
<PAGE>

Section 2.5(e) shall not be affected by, among other things, (A) the
validity or genuineness of any documents or of any endorsements thereon,
even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent
or forged, provided, that reliance upon such documents by the Issuing Bank
shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct
by the Issuing Bank or (B) any dispute between or among the Borrower and
any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other Person to which such
Letter of Credit may be transferred or (C) any claims whatsoever of the
Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such
transferee.


(iii) The Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any error,
omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any
message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of
Credit, except for errors or omissions caused by the Issuing Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

(iv)  The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted
by the Issuing Bank under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the
related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall neither result
in any liability of the Issuing Bank to the Borrower nor constitute a defense
to the Borrower's obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank.

(g)  Letter of Credit Payments. If any draft shall be presented
for payment to the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank
shall promptly notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The
responsibility of the Issuing Bank to the Borrower in connection with any draft
presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any
payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited
to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such
Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are in conformity with
such Letter of Credit.

(h)  Application. To the extent that any provision of any
Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions
of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply.

2.6  Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank a commitment fee (a "Commitment Fee") for the period from
and including the first day of the Commitment Period to the Termination Date,
computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Commitment Fee Rate in
effect from time to time, calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the
actual days elapsed, on the average daily amount of the difference between the
Commitment of such Bank and its Exposure during the period for which payment is
made, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June,
September and December and on the Termination Date or such earlier date as the
Total Commitment shall be permanently reduced or terminated as provided herein,
commencing on the first of such dates to occur after the Effective Date. Each
payment by the Borrower on account of the Commitment Fee shall be made pro rata
according to the Banks' respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages.

27
<PAGE>

(b)  All fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among
the Banks. Once paid, none of the fees shall be refundable under any
circumstances.

2.7  Notes; Repayment of Revolving Credit Loans. The Revolving
Credit Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced by a single Revolving Credit
Note duly executed on behalf of the Borrower, dated the Effective Date, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 with the blanks
appropriately filled, payable to such Bank in a principal amount equal to the
Commitment of such Bank. Each Note shall bear interest from the date thereof on
the outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section 2.8. The
outstanding principal balance of each Revolving Credit Loan, as evidenced by
the relevant Note, shall be payable on the Termination Date. The Borrower
hereby authorizes the Agent to charge any deposit account of the Borrower
maintained with the Agent for any payment when due hereunder or under the Notes.

2.8  Interest on Revolving Credit Loans. (a) Subject to the
provisions of Section 2.9, each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest (computed on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days,
as the case may be) at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin (the "Base Rate Option").

(b)   Subject to the provisions of Section 2.9, each Eurodollar
Loan shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Loan plus the Applicable Margin
(the "Eurodollar Rate Option").

(c)  Interest on each Revolving Credit Loan shall be payable on
each Interest Payment Date applicable to such Loan; provided, that interest
accruing on overdue amounts pursuant to Section 2.9 shall be payable on demand.
The Agent's calculation of the Eurodollar Rate and the Base Rate shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

2.9  Default Rate; Inability to Determine Interest Rate. (a) Upon
the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default under
Section 7.1(a) or (g), the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and, to
the extent permitted by law, accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other
amount payable hereunder shall bear interest from the date of such occurrence
until paid in full (after as well as before judgment) at a rate per annum which
is equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the Base Rate Option. Upon the
occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default other than
under Section 7.1(a) or (g), the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and,
to the extent permitted by law, accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any
other amount payable hereunder shall bear interest from the date that the Agent
shall send notice to the Borrower of the application of the default rate until
paid in full (after as well as before judgment) at a rate per annum which is
equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the Base Rate Option. The Borrower
acknowledges that such increased interest rate reflects, among other things,
the fact that such loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater
risk given its default status and that the Banks are entitled to additional
compensation for such risk.

28
<PAGE>

(b)  In the event, and on each occasion, that prior to the
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan, the Agent shall have
determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Borrower) that dollar deposits in the principal amount of such Eurodollar Loan
are not generally available in the London interbank market, or that the rate at
which such dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to the Banks of making or maintaining the principal amount of
such Eurodollar Loan during such Interest Period, or that reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, the Agent shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, give written, telegraphic or telephonic notice of such
determination to the Borrower and the Banks. After such notice shall have been
given and until the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist,
each request for a Eurodollar Loan or for conversion to or maintenance of a
Eurodollar Loan pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
request for a Base Rate Loan.

2.10  Termination, Reduction and Extension of Commitments. (a) The
Total Commitment shall be automatically terminated on the Termination Date.

(b)  Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, upon at
least five Business Days' prior irrevocable written or telecopy notice to the
Agent, the Borrower may at any time in whole permanently terminate, or from
time to time permanently reduce, the Total Commitment. Each partial reduction
of the Total Commitment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 or
in whole multiples thereof, and no such termination or reduction shall be made
which would, after giving effect to any prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans
on such date reduce the Total Commitment to an amount less than the amount of
the Total Exposure.

(c)  Each reduction in the Total Commitment hereunder shall be
made ratably among the Banks in accordance with their respective Commitment
Percentages. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of the
relevant Banks, on the date of each termination or reduction, the Commitment
Fees on the amount of the Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued to the
date of such termination or reduction. In connection with any reduction of the
Total Commitment, the Borrower shall make any prepayment required under Section
2.11(b).

(d)  During the period beginning ninety days prior to the then
effective Termination Date and ending sixty (60) days prior to such Termination
Date, the Borrower may deliver to the Agent (which shall promptly transmit to
each Bank) a notice requesting that the Commitments be extended for an
additional nine months beyond the Termination Date then in effect. Within
forty-five days after its receipt of any such notice, each Bank shall notify
the Agent of its willingness or unwillingness to extend its Commitment. Any
Bank that shall fail to notify the Agent within such period shall be deemed to
have declined to extend its Commitment. If each (but only if each) Bank agrees
to extend its Commitment, the Agent shall so notify the Borrower and each Bank,
whereupon (i) the respective Commitments of the Banks shall without further act
by any party hereto, be extended to the date nine months after the Termination
Date then in effect and (ii) the term "Termination Date" shall thereafter mean
such date. Any such extension shall be evidenced by a written agreement among
the Agent, the Banks and the

29
<PAGE>

Borrower, such agreement to be in form and substance acceptable to the Agent
and the Banks. In the event that one or more Banks (each a "Non-Electing Bank")
shall have declined or been deemed to have declined to extend its or their
Commitment and Banks holding a majority in amount of the Commitments shall have
notified the Agent of their desire to extend their Commitments, the Borrower
shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its own expense, upon notice
to each such Non-Electing Bank and the Agent, to replace all (but not less than
all) such Non-Electing Banks (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 9.6) at any time before the thirtieth (30th)
day prior to the Termination Date with one or more assignees (each a
"Replacement Bank") willing to purchase all of the Non-Electing Banks'
interests hereunder and to agree to extend its or their Commitment in
accordance with the notice referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
(d). In such event, each Non-Electing Bank shall promptly upon request transfer
and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in Section 9.6) all its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement to the applicable Replacement Bank; provided, however, that (i) no
such assignment shall conflict with any law or any rule, regulation or order of
any Governmental Authority, (ii) the applicable Replacement Bank shall pay to
the applicable Non-Electing Bank in immediately available funds on the date of
such assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on
the Loans made by such Non-Electing Bank hereunder and all other amounts
accrued for such Non-Electing Bank's account or owed to it hereunder (including
Commitment Fees and any unpaid costs or expenses), and (iii) a Non-Electing
Bank shall not be required to sell its interests hereunder unless the Borrower
has arranged for one or more Replacement Banks to acquire the interests of all
other Non-Electing Banks. If, as a result of the foregoing, each Bank
(including Replacement Banks, but excluding Non-Electing Banks whose interests
have been purchased as provided above) has agreed to extend its Commitment, the
Commitments shall be extended as provided in clause (i) of the fourth sentence
of this paragraph and the term Termination Date shall have the meaning set
forth in clause (ii) in such fourth sentence of this paragraph (d).

2.11  Optional and Mandatory Prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans
(a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to
prepay any Revolving Credit Borrowing, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty (but in any event subject to Section 2.15), upon prior written,
telecopy or telephonic notice to the Agent given no later than 10:30 a.m.,
Wilmington time, one Business Day before any proposed prepayment; provided,
however, that each such partial prepayment shall be in the principal amount of
at least (x) with respect to Base Rate Loans, $100,000 or in whole multiples
thereof and (y) with respect to Eurodollar Loans, $500,000 or in whole
multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in either case, the entire amount
outstanding, whether or not divisible by $100,000.

(b)  On the date of any reduction of the Total Commitment
pursuant to Section 2.10, the Borrower shall pay or prepay so much of the
Revolving Credit Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that, after giving
effect to such reduction and any such payments, the Total Exposure at such time
will not exceed the Total Commitment.

(c)  Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment
date and the principal amount of each Borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans to be
prepaid, shall be

30
<PAGE>

irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Borrowing (or portion
thereof) by the amount stated therein. All prepayments on Eurodollar Loans
under this Section shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal
amount being prepaid to the date of prepayment.

2.12  Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application
thereof shall make it unlawful for any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Bank
hereunder to make or refinance Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as
such and convert or refinance Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall
forthwith be cancelled and (b) such Bank's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar
Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the
respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such
Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such conversion
of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then
current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such
Bank such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.15.

2.13  Requirements of Law. (a) In the event that any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation, or application thereof or
compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made
subsequent to the date hereof:

(i)   shall subject any Bank to any tax of any kind
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Note, any Letter of Credit,
any Application or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of
taxation of payments to such Bank in respect thereof (except for taxes
covered by Section 2.14 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net
income, gross receipts or revenue of such Bank);

(ii)  shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or
other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other
extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office
of such Bank which is not otherwise included in the determination of the
interest rate on such Eurodollar Loan hereunder; or

(iii) shall impose on such Bank any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank, by
an amount which such Bank deems to be material, of making, converting into,
continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in
Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect
thereof then, in any such case, the Borrower shall as promptly as practicable
pay such Bank, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate
such Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable; provided, that
the Borrower shall not be liable for any such amounts incurred by such Bank
more than 90 days prior to the date of such Bank's notification to the
Borrower. If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant
to this subsection, it shall as promptly as practicable notify the

31
<PAGE>

Borrower, through the Agent, of the event by reason of which it has become so
entitled. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
subsection submitted by such Bank, through the Agent, to the Borrower shall be
reasonably detailed and include supporting documentation, and shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

(b)  In the event that any Bank shall have determined that any
change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Bank or any
corporation controlling such Bank with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or such corporation's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder or under any Letter of Credit to a
level below that which such Bank or such corporation could have achieved but
for such change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or such
corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by
such Bank to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Bank
to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) of a written request therefor, which
shall be reasonably detailed and include supporting documentation, the Borrower
shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Bank for such reduction; provided, that the Borrower shall not be liable
for any such amounts incurred by such Bank more than 90 days prior to the date
of such Bank's notification to the Borrower.

(c)  Each Bank agrees that it will use reasonable efforts in
order to avoid or to minimize, as the case may be, the payment by the Borrower
of any additional amount under Section 2.13(b); provided, however, that no Bank
shall be obligated to incur any expense, cost or other amount in connection
with utilizing such reasonable efforts.

(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 2.13(a), (b) and
(c), the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts to any
Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States or a state
thereof as a result of any change in any Requirement of Law or compliance by
such Bank with any request or directive from any central bank or Governmental
Authority to the extent that such additional amounts exceed the amounts that
would have been payable by the Borrower under Section 2.13(a), (b) or (c) to a
Bank incorporated under the laws of the United States or a state thereof.

2.14  Taxes. (a)  All payments made by the Borrower under this
Agreement and the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority (excluding, net income taxes and franchise or
gross receipts taxes imposed in lieu of net income taxes imposed on the Agent
or any Bank as a result of a present or former connection between the
jurisdiction of the government or taxing authority imposing such tax and the
Agent or such Bank (excluding a connection arising solely from the Agent or
such Bank having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a

32
<PAGE>

payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or the Notes)) (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions and
withholdings being hereinafter called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are required to be
withheld from any amounts payable to the Agent or any Bank hereunder or under
the Notes, the amounts so payable to the Agent or such Bank shall be increased
to the extent necessary to yield to the Agent or such Bank (after payment of
all Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or
in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the Notes. Whenever any Taxes
are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower
shall send to the Agent for its own account or for the account of such Bank, as
the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by
the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes
when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Agent the
required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall
indemnify the Agent and the Banks for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Bank as a result of any
such failure. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

(b)  Each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to the
Borrower and the Agent (i) two duly completed copies of United States Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN or successor applicable form, as the case
may be, and (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor
applicable form. Each such Bank also agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the
Agent two further copies of the said Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN and Form W-8 or W-9,
or successor applicable forms or other manner of certification, as the case may
be, on or before the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or
after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form
previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and such extensions or renewals
thereof as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Agent, unless in
any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty,
law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery
would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with
respect to it and such Bank so advises the Borrower and the Agent. Such Bank
shall certify (i) in the case of a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, that it is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of
any United States federal income taxes and (ii) in the case of a Form W-8 or
W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding
tax.

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 2.14(a) or (b), the
Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts pursuant to such
Sections (i) to any Bank in respect of United States withholding tax if (A) the
obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a
failure by such Bank to comply with the requirements of Section 2.14(b) or (B)
such Bank shall not have furnished the Borrower with such forms listed in
Section 2.14(b) and shall not have taken such other steps as reasonably may be
available to it under applicable tax laws and any applicable tax treaty or
convention to obtain an exemption from, or reduction (to the lowest applicable
rate) of, such United States withholding tax or (ii) to any Bank that is not
incorporated under the laws of the United States or a state thereof to the
extent that such additional amounts exceed the amounts that would have been
payable by the Borrower

33
<PAGE>

under Section 2.14(a) or (b) to a Bank incorporated under the laws of the
United States or a state thereof.

2.15  Indemnity. (a) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Bank and to
hold each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which such Bank may sustain or
incur as a consequence of (i) default by the Borrower in payment when due of
the principal amount of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan, (ii) default by the
Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of
Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (iii) default by the Borrower
in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (iv) the making of a
prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day which is not the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

(b)  For the purpose of calculation of all amounts payable to a
Bank under this subsection, each Bank shall be deemed to have actually funded
its relevant Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit bearing interest
at the Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of that Eurodollar Loan
and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided,
however, that each Bank may fund each of its Eurodollar Loans in any manner it
sees fit, and the foregoing assumption shall be utilized only for the
calculation of amounts payable under this subsection. This covenant shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

2.16  Pro Rata Treatment, etc. Except as required under Section
2.12, each Revolving Credit Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal
of any Revolving Credit Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Revolving
Credit Loans, each payment of Letter of Credit fees (other than fees for the
account of the Issuing Bank), each reduction of the Commitments, each
refinancing of any Borrowing with a Revolving Credit Borrowing of any Type,
each payment of Commitment Fees and each conversion of Revolving Credit Loans,
shall be made pro rata among the Banks in accordance with their respective
Commitment Percentages. Each Bank agrees that in computing such Bank's portion
of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Agent may, in its discretion, round
each Bank's percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole
dollar amount.

2.17  Payments. The Borrower shall make each payment (including
principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees or other amounts) hereunder
not later than 12:00 (noon), Wilmington time, on the date when due in Dollars
to the Agent at its offices specified in Section 9.2 or at such other place as
may be designated by the Agent, in immediately available funds. Such payments
shall be made without set off or counterclaim of any kind. The Agent shall
distribute to the Banks any payments received by the Agent on the date received
in like funds as received.

(b)  Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest
on any Loan or any fees or other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or
otherwise would occur, on a

34
<PAGE>

day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of interest or fees, if applicable.

2.18  Conversion and Continuation Options. The Borrower shall have
the right at any time upon prior irrevocable notice to the Agent (i) not later
than 12:00 noon, Wilmington time, on the Business Day of conversion, to convert
any Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan, (ii) not later than 12:00 noon,
Wilmington time, three Business Days prior to conversion or continuation, to
(y) convert any Base Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Loan, or (z) to continue any
Eurodollar Loan as a Eurodollar Loan for any additional Interest Period and
(iii) not later than 12:00 noon, Wilmington time, three Business Days prior to
conversion, to convert the Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan
to another permissible Interest Period, subject in each case to the following:

(a)  a Eurodollar Loan may not be converted at a time other
than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto;

(b)  any portion of a Loan maturing or required to be repaid in
less than one month may not be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar
Loan;

(c)  no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such and no Base
Rate Loan may be converted to a Eurodollar Loan when any Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent or the Required Banks have
determined that such a continuation is not appropriate;

(d)  any portion of a Eurodollar Loan that cannot be converted
into or continued as a Eurodollar Loan by reason of Section 2.18(b) or (c)
automatically shall be converted at the end of the Interest Period in effect
for such Loan to a Base Rate Loan; and

(e)  on the last day of any Interest Period for Eurodollar
Loans if the Borrower shall have failed to give notice of conversion or
continuation as described in this subsection or if such conversion or
continuation is not permitted pursuant to this Section 2.18, such Loans shall
be converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest
Period.

Accrued interest on a Loan (or portion thereof) being converted shall be paid
by the Borrower at the time of conversion.

2.19  Use of Proceeds. The Letters of Credit and the proceeds of the
Loans shall be used by the Borrower for working capital and general corporate
purposes in the ordinary course of business (including, but not limited to,
refinancing existing working capital-related indebtedness and, subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, acquisition financing).

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Agent and the Banks to enter into this Agreement, and
to make the Loans and to issue and/or participate in Letters of Credit, the
Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Agent and each Bank that:

3.1   Financial Condition. (a) Audited Financials. The consolidated
balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December
31, 2000 and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows
for the fiscal year ended on such date, copies of which have heretofore been
furnished to each Bank, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the fiscal year then ended. All such financial statements, including the
related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied consistently throughout the periods involved. Neither the Borrower nor
any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had, as of December 31, 2000, any material
Contingent Obligation, liability for taxes, or any long-term lease or unusual
forward or long-term commitment, including, without limitation, any Interest
Hedge Agreement, which is not reflected in the financial statements contained
in the Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31,
2000 or the notes thereto.

(b)  No Sales. During the period from December 31, 2000, to and
including the date of this Agreement there has been no sale, transfer or other
disposition by the Borrower or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries of any
material part of its business or property and no purchase or other acquisition
of any business or property (including any Capital Stock of any other Person)
material in relation to the financial condition of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 except for the transaction
referred to in Section 6.4(c) hereof.

3.2   No Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2000, there has been no
development or event nor any prospective development or event which has had or
could reasonably be expected individually or in the aggregate to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

3.3   Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. Each of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the
corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its
property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the
business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its
ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification except to the extent that the failure to be so
qualified and/or in good standing could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (d) is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith
could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

36
<PAGE>

3.4   Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. The
Borrower has the corporate power, authority, and legal right, to make, deliver
and perform this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents to which it
is a party and to borrow hereunder and has taken all necessary corporate action
to authorize the borrowings on the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Notes and to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party. No
consent or authorization of, filing with or other act by or in respect of, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person (including stockholders and
creditors of the Borrower) is required in connection with the borrowings
hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or
enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents. This
Agreement has been, and each Note and other Loan Document will be, duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower. This Agreement constitutes,
and each Note and other Loan Document when executed and delivered will
constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable
against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

3.5   No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents by the Borrower, the
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any
Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or of any of its
Subsidiaries and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any of its or their respective properties or revenues pursuant to
any such Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation.

3.6   No Material Litigation. No litigation, investigation or
proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective properties or revenues
(a) with respect to this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) as to which there is a
reasonable likelihood of an adverse determination and which, if adversely
determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.7   No Default. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in any
respect which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

3.8   Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has filed or
caused to be filed all tax returns which, to its knowledge, are required to be
filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on
any assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes,
fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental
Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are currently being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which
reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as

37
<PAGE>

the case may be); no tax Lien has been filed against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, no claim is being
asserted, with respect to any such tax, fee or other charges.

3.9   Federal Regulations.  No part of the proceeds of any Loans
will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the
respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U or for any
purpose which violates the provisions of Regulation U. If requested by any Bank
or the Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent and each Bank a statement
to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form U-l
referred to in said Regulation U. No part of the proceeds of the loans
hereunder will be used for any purpose which violates, or which is inconsistent
with, the provisions of Regulation X.

3.10  ERISA. (a) Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on
which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Single
Employer Plan, and each Single Employer Plan has compiled in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. No termination
of a Single Employer Plan has occurred and no lien in favor of the PBGC or a
Plan has arisen during the five-year period prior to the date as of which this
representation is made or deemed made. No other event or condition has occurred
or exists with respect to any Plan that could reasonably be expected
individually or in the aggregate to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b)     The present value of all accrued benefits under
each Single Employer Plan in which the Borrower or any Commonly Controlled
Entity is a participant (based on those assumptions used to fund the Plans)
Did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such
Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by an amount in excess of ten percent
(10%) of Consolidated Net Worth as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of
the Borrower for which financial statements have been delivered to the Banks
pursuant to this Agreement.

(c)     Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled
Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan,
and neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become
subject to any liability under ERISA if the Borrower or any such Commonly
Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as
of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, in any such case which could reasonably
be expected individually or in the aggregate to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d)     To the Borrower's knowledge, no such Multiemployer
Plan is in "reorganization" or "insolvent," within the meaning of such terms as
used in ERISA.

(e)     The present value (determined using actuarial and
other assumptions which are reasonable in respect of the benefits provided and
the employees participating) of the liability of the Borrower and each Commonly
Controlled Entity for post retirement benefits to be provided to their current
and former employees under Plans which are

38
<PAGE>

welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) does not, in the
aggregate, exceed the assets under all such Plans allocable to such benefits by
an amount in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Borrower's consolidated net
worth as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of the Borrower for which
financial statements have been delivered to the Banks pursuant to this
Agreement.


3.11  Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company Act.
Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment
company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; (b) a "holding
company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company" or an "affiliate" of
either a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" within the meaning of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or (c) subject to any
other federal or state law or regulation which purports to restrict or regulate
its ability to borrow money.

3.12  Purpose of Loans; Letters of Credit. The proceeds of the
Loans and the Letters of Credit shall only be used by the Borrower for the
purposes permitted under Section 2.19.

3.13  Environmental Matters. To the best knowledge of the Borrower,
each of the representations and warranties set forth in paragraphs (a) through
(e) of this subsection is true and correct with respect to each parcel of real
property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Properties"), except to the extent that the facts and circumstances giving
rise to any such failure to be so true and correct could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

(a)     The Properties do not contain, and have not previously
contained, in, on, or under, including, without limitation, the soil and
groundwater thereunder, any Materials of Environmental Concern in
concentrations which violate Environmental Laws.

(b)     The Properties and all operations and facilities at
the Properties are in compliance with Environmental Laws, and there is no
Materials of Environmental Concern contamination or violation of any
Environmental Law which would materially interfere with the continued operation
of any of the Properties or materially impair the fair saleable value of any
thereof.

(c)     Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received or is aware of any claim, notice of violation, alleged violation,
non-compliance, investigation or advisory action or potential liability
regarding environmental matters or compliance of Environmental Law with regard
to the Properties which has not been satisfactorily resolved by the Borrower or
such Subsidiary, nor is the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries aware or have
reason to believe that any such action is being contemplated, considered or
threatened.

(d)     Materials of Environmental Concern have not been
generated, treated, stored, disposed of, at, on or under any of the Properties
in violation of Environmental Laws, nor have any Materials of Environmental
Concern been transferred from the Properties to

39
<PAGE>

any other location except in either case in the ordinary course of business of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and in material compliance with all
Environmental Laws.

(e)     There are no governmental, administrative actions or
judicial proceedings pending or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
contemplated under any Environmental Laws to which the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is or will be named as a party with respect to the Properties, nor
are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent orders, administrative
orders or other orders, or other administrative or judicial requirements
outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect to any of the Properties.

3.14  No Burdensome Restrictions. No Requirement of Law or
Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.15  Ownership of Borrower and Subsidiaries. The beneficial
ownership of the Capital Stock of the Borrower by its executive officers,
directors and 5% shareholders has not changed materially from that set forth in
the Borrower's most recent proxy statement as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The Borrower owns all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of each of the Guarantors and, as of the date of this Agreement,
the Borrower owns all of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of each of
its Subsidiaries.

3.16  Patents, Trademarks, etc. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has obtained and holds in full force and effect or is licensed to
use all patents, trademarks, servicemarks, trade names, copyrights and other
such rights, free from burdensome restrictions, which are necessary for the
operation of its business as presently conducted. To the Borrower's best
knowledge, no material product, process, method, substance, part or other
material presently sold by or employed by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in
connection with such business infringes any patent, trademark, service mark,
trade name, copyright, license or other right owned by any other Person. There
is not pending or, to the Borrower's knowledge, overtly threatened any claim or
litigation against or affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary contesting its
right to sell or use any such product, process, method, substance, part or
other material which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

3.17  Ownership of Property. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries has good and marketable fee simple title to or valid leasehold
interests in all real property owned or leased by it, and good title to all of
its personal property subject to no Lien of any kind except Permitted Liens.

3.18  Licenses, etc. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
has obtained and holds in full force and effect, all franchises, licenses,
permits, certificates, authorizations, qualifications, easements, rights of way
and other rights, consents and approvals which are necessary for the operation
of its business as presently conducted.

3.19  Labor Matters. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.19, as of
the Effective Date, there are no collective bargaining agreements or
Multiemployer Plans covering the employees of the Borrower, and the Borrower
has not suffered any strikes, walkouts, work

40
<PAGE>

stoppages or other material labor difficulty within the last five years and to
the best knowledge of the Borrower, there are none now threatened.

3.20  Material Contracts. All material contracts relating to the
business operations of the Borrower are valid, binding and enforceable upon the
Borrower and, to the Borrower's knowledge, each of the parties thereto in
accordance with their respective terms, and there is no material default
thereunder, to the Borrower's knowledge, with respect to parties other than the
Borrower.

3.21  Insurance. The Borrower currently maintains insurance which
meets or exceeds the requirements of Section 5.5. Except as set for on Schedule
3.21, no notice has been given or claim made and no grounds exist to cancel or
avoid any insurance policies or other bonds to which the Borrower is a party or
to reduce the coverage provided thereby or any replacements thereof. Such
policies and bonds or any replacements thereof provide adequate coverage from
reputable and financially sound insurers in amounts sufficient to insure the
assets and risks of the Borrower in accordance with prudent business practice
in the industry of the Borrowers.

3.22  Senior Debt Status. The obligations of the Borrower under
this Agreement and the Notes do rank and will rank at least pari passu in
priority of payment with all other indebtedness of the Borrower except
indebtedness of the Borrower to the extent secured by Permitted Liens. There is
no Lien upon or with respect to any of the properties or income of the Borrower
which secures indebtedness or other obligations of any Person except for
Permitted Liens.

3.23  No Material Misstatements. To the best of the Borrower's
knowledge, no information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any
Subsidiary to the Agent or any Bank in this Agreement or any Schedule or
Exhibit attached hereto, contains any misstatement of fact, or omitted or omits
to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
where such misstatement or omission would be material to the interests of the
Banks with respect to the Borrower's performance of its obligations hereunder.
Any projections, forecasts or budgets provided by the Borrower to the Agent or
any Bank (other than the financial projections delivered pursuant to Section
5.2(b) hereof) are expressly excluded from this Section and the Borrower makes
no representation or warranty as to their accuracy or reliability. With regard
to the financial projections delivered pursuant to Section 5.2(b), the Borrower
shall be entitled to a cross-reference therein to the forward-looking
statements disclaimers contained in its filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the benefits of the safe harbor afforded under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

of Credit shall have presented the documents required thereunder) to be due and
payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and payable.

With respect to all Letters of Credit with respect to which
presentment for honor shall not have occurred at the time of an acceleration
pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Borrower shall at such time deposit in
a cash collateral account opened by the Agent an amount equal to the aggregate
then undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit. The Borrower
hereby grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank, the L/C
Participants and the Banks and the Agent, a security interest in such cash
collateral to secure all obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Amounts held in such cash collateral account shall be
applied by the Agent to the payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of
Credit, and the unused portion thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall
have expired or been fully drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other
obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan
Documents. After all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully
drawn upon, all Reimbursement Obligations shall have been satisfied and all
other obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the Notes and the other
Loan Documents shall have been paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash
collateral account shall be returned to the Borrower. The Borrower shall
execute and deliver to the Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, the L/C
Participants, the Banks and the Agent, such further documents and instruments
as the Agent may request to evidence the creation and perfection of the within
security interest in such cash collateral account.

Except as expressly provided above in this Section, presentment,
demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived.

SECTION 8. THE AGENT

8.1   Appointment. Each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints PNC Bank, Delaware as the Agent of such Bank under this Agreement.
Each such Bank irrevocably authorizes the Agent, as the agent for such Bank to
take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent. The Agent agrees to act as the
Agent on behalf of the Banks to the extent provided in this Agreement.

8.2   Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be
entitled to engage and pay for

55
<PAGE>

the advice and services of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such
duties. The Agent shall not be responsible to the Banks for the negligence or
misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable
care.

8.3   Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall
be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or
such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct) or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Banks for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower or any
officer thereof contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan
Documents or for any failure of the Borrower to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder.  The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any
Bank to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of
the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or
any Subsidiary.

8.4   Reliance by Agent.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Borrower or any Subsidiary),
independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent.  The agent may
deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes
unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall
have been filed with the Agent.  The Agent shall be fully justified in failing
or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Banks as they deem
appropriate or they shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request
of the Required Banks, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and all future holders of
the Notes.

8.5   Notice of Default.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless it has received notice from a Bank or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default".  In the event that the Agent receives
such a notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Banks.  The Agent
shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as
shall be reasonably directed by the Required Banks; provided, that unless and
until the Agent shall have received such

56
<PAGE>

directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks.

8.6   Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks.  Each Bank expressly
acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations
or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including
any review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent to any Bank.  Each Bank represents to
the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any
other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Borrower and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into
this Agreement.  Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Borrower.  Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required
to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have
any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

8.7   Indemnification.  The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent in its
capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their
respective Commitment Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Notes)
be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to
or arising out of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, that no Bank shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting solely from the Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct.  The agreements in this Section 8.7 shall survive the payment of
the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

8.8   Agent in its Individual Capacity.  The Agent and its Affiliates
may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower as though it was not the Agent hereunder.  With
respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it and with
respect to any Letter of Credit issued or participated in it by it, the

57
<PAGE>

Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any Bank
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank"
and "Banks" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.

8.9   Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days'
notice to the Banks and the Borrower.  If the Agent shall resign as Agent under
this Agreement, then the Required Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a
successor agent for the Banks, which appointment shall be subject to the
approval of the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld)
and of such successor agent.  Any rejection by the Borrower of a successor
agent shall specify the reasons for such rejection.  Failure of the Borrower to
approve or reject a successor agent within ten days following request for
approval shall be deemed to constitute approval.  Upon such appointment and
approval, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties
of the Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective
upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent
shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of
such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the
Notes.  After any retiring Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this
Section 8 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

8.10  Beneficiaries.  Except as expressly provided herein, the
provisions of this Section 8 are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the
Banks, and the Borrower shall not have any rights to rely on or enforce any of
the provisions hereof.  In performing its functions and duties under this
Agreement, the Agent shall act solely as agent of the Banks and does not assume
and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship
of agency or trust with or for the Borrower.

SECTION 9.   MISCELLANEOUS

9.1   Amendments and Waivers.  Neither this Agreement, any Note or any
other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended,
supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection.  With the written consent of the Required Banks, the Agent and the
Borrower may, from time to time, enter into written amendments, supplements or
modifications hereto and to the Notes and the other Loan Documents for the
purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the Notes or the other
Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Banks or of the
Borrower hereunder or thereunder or waiving, on such terms and conditions as
the Agent may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this
Agreement or the Notes or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of
Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no
such amendment, supplement or modification shall directly or indirectly (a)
reduce the amount or extend the maturity of any Note or any installment
thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon,
or reduce any fee payable to any Bank hereunder, or change the duration or
amount of any Bank's Commitment, in each case without the consent of the Bank
affected thereby or (b) amend, modify or waive any provision of this

58
<PAGE>

Section 9.1 or reduce the percentages specified in the definition of Required
Banks or consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan
Documents, in each case without the written consent of all the Banks, or (c)
amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 8 without the written consent
of the then Agent, (d) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.3
without the written consent of the then Swing Line Bank or (e) amend, modify or
waive any provision of this Agreement relating to any outstanding Letter of
Credit without the written consent of the Issuing Bank.  Any such waiver and
any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of
the Banks and shall be binding upon the Borrower, the Banks, the Agent and all
future holders of the Notes.  In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the
Banks and the Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights
hereunder and under the outstanding Notes, and any Default or Event of Default
waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any
right consequent thereon.

9.2   Notices.  All notices, requests and demands to or upon the
respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing (including by

any such other documents (all the foregoing, collectively, the "indemnified
liabilities"), provided, that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder
to the Agent or any Bank with respect to indemnified liabilities arising from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any such Bank.  The
agreements in this subsection shall survive repayment of the Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

9.6   Successors and Assigns. (a)  Except as otherwise provided in
Section 9.8(b), whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is
referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and
assigns of such party, and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on
behalf of the Borrower, the Agent or the Banks that are contained in this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors
and assigns.  The Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents without the prior
written consent of each Bank.

(b)  Each Bank may, in accordance with applicable law, sell all
or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment or, if
an Event of Default has occurred, the Swing Line Commitment, and the Loans at
the time owing to it and the Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i)
each such assignment shall be to a Bank or Affiliate thereof, or, with the
consents of the Agent and the Borrower (which consents shall not be
unreasonably withheld) to one or more banks or other financial institutions,
(ii) so long as the Commitments are in effect, the amount of each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not be less than
$5,000,000 (or, if lower, the lesser of (x) the full amount of such Bank's
Commitments and (y) such amount as the Borrower and the Agent shall agree in
their sole discretion), (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute
and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with the Note
or Notes subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500, (iv) in the case of the assignment of the Swing Line Commitment, may
only be made to a Bank which holds a Commitment hereunder and must be of the
entire Swing Line Commitment and (v) each such assignment of Loans and all or
any portion of a Bank's Commitment shall be of a constant, and not a varying,
percentage of the assigning Bank's Commitment and Revolving Credit Loans then
outstanding.  Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (e) of this
Section 9.6, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least five Business Days after the
execution thereof (unless otherwise agreed by the Agent), (A) the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank
under this Agreement and (B) the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from
its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement

61
<PAGE>

and the other Loan Documents, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but
shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14,
2.15 and 9.5 (to the extent that such Bank's entitlement to such benefits arose
out of such Bank's position as a Bank prior to the applicable assignment), as
well as to any Commitment Fees accrued for its account and not yet paid).  Such
Assignment and Acceptance shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the
extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such
assignee Bank and the resulting amounts and percentages held by the Banks
arising from the purchase by such assignee Bank of all or a portion of the
rights and obligations of such assigning Bank under this Agreement, the Notes
and the other Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Section
9.6, the consent of the Borrower shall not be required for any assignment which
occurs at any time when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.

(c)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the assigning Bank thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows:
(i) such assigning Bank warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of
the interest being assigned thereby, free and clear of any adverse claim, and
that its Commitment and/or Commitments and/or Swing Line Commitment, as the
case may be, and the outstanding balances of its Loans, in each case without
giving effect to assignments thereof which have not become effective, are as
set forth in such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) except as set forth in (i)
above, such assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or any other instrument or
document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, or the financial condition of
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or observance by the Borrower
or any Subsidiary of any of their obligations under this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee
represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee confirms that it has received a
copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial
statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.1 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such assignee will
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Bank or any
other Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (vi) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which
by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required to be
performed by it as a Bank.

(d)  The Agent shall maintain at its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance and the names and addresses of the Banks, and the
Commitment and/or Swing Line Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans
owing to, each Bank pursuant to the

62
<PAGE>

terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error and the Borrower, the
Agent and the Banks may treat each person whose name is recorded in the
Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of
this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice.

(e)  Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Bank and an assignee together with the Note
or Notes subject to such assignment, the processing and recordation fee
referred to in paragraph (b) above, the Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment
and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register
and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. Within five Business Days
after receipt of notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Agent, in exchange for the surrendered original Note(s), (x) a
new Revolving Credit Note to the order of such assignee in an amount equal to
the portion of the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance and, if applicable, a new Swing Line Note to the order of such
assignee in an amount equal to the Swing Line Commitment and, (y) if the
assigning Bank has retained a Commitment, a new Revolving Credit Note to the
order of such assigning Bank in a principal amount equal to the applicable
Commitment retained by it. Such new Notes shall be dated the date of the
surrendered Notes which they replace and shall otherwise be in substantially
the form of Exhibit B-1 or Exhibit B-2 hereto, as appropriate. Canceled Notes
shall be returned to the Borrower.

(f)  Each Bank may without the consent of the Borrower or the
Agent sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (each a
"Participant") in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment or Swing Line
Commitment and the Loans owing to it and the Notes held by it); provided,
however, that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Bank shall remain
the holder of any such Note for all purposes under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, (iv) the Borrower, the Banks and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (v) in any
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code the Bank shall be, to the extent permitted
by law, the sole representative with respect to the obligations held in the
name of such Bank, whether for its own account or for the account of any
Participant and (vi) such Bank shall retain the sole right to approve, without
the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Note or Notes held by such Bank or any other
Loan Document, other than any such amendment, modification or waiver with
respect to any Loan or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest
that forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees
payable with respect to any such Loan or Commitment, or postpones any date
fixed for any regularly scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees
on, any such Loan, or releases any guarantor of such Loan or releases all or
substantially all of the collateral, if any, securing any such Loan.

63
<PAGE>

(g)  The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.18 and 9.5 with respect
to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans and Letters of Credit
outstanding from time to time; provided, that no Participant shall be entitled
to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the assigning Bank
would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the
participation transferred by such assigning Bank to such Participant had no
such transfer occurred.

(h)  If any Participant of a Bank is organized under the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, the
assigning Bank, concurrently with the sale of a participating interest to such
Participant, shall cause such Participant (i) to represent to the assigning
Bank (for the benefit of the assigning Bank, the other Banks, the Agent and the
Borrower) that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to
be withheld by the Agent, the Borrower or the assigning Bank with respect to
any payments to be made to such Participant in respect of its participation in
the Loans and (ii) to agree (for the benefit of the assigning Bank, the other
Banks, the Agent and the Borrower) that it will deliver the tax forms and other
documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.14(b) and comply from
time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with respect to
withholding tax exemptions.

(i)  Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and the Notes issued to it to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that no such assignment shall release a Bank from any of its
obligations hereunder.

9.7   Disclosure of Information. Unless otherwise consented to by the
Borrower in writing, each of the Banks and the Agent agrees (on behalf of
itself and each of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
representatives) to use reasonable precautions to keep confidential, in
accordance with its customary procedures for handling confidential information
of the same nature and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, any
non-public information supplied to it by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, that nothing herein shall limit the disclosure of any such
information (a) to the extent required by statute, rule, regulation or judicial
process, (b) to counsel for any Bank or the Agent, (c) to bank examiners,
auditors or accountants, (d) to the Agent or any other Bank, (e) in connection
with any litigation to which any one or more of the Banks or the Agent is a
party involving the Borrower or any Subsidiary or its or their properties or in
any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any Loans or
Letters of Credit or other obligations of the Borrower to the Agent or any Bank
and (f) to any Participant or assignee Bank (or prospective Participant or
assignee Bank) so long as such Participant or assignee Bank (or prospective
Participant or assignee Bank) agrees to comply with the requirements of this
Section. In the event of any disclosure pursuant to clauses (a) or (e) above,
the Agent or Bank making such disclosure, as the case may be, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to notify the Borrower prior to making such disclosure,
and shall cooperate with the Borrower, at the Borrower's expense, in obtaining
a protective order if the Borrower so chooses.

9.8   Adjustments; Set-off. (a) If any Bank (a "benefitted Bank")
shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans or the
Reimbursement Obligation owing to it, or interest thereon, or receive any
collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or

<PAGE>

involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 7.1(g), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any
such payment to or collateral received by any other Bank, if any, in respect of
such other Bank's Loans or the Reimbursement Obligation owing to it, or
interest thereon, such benefitted Bank shall purchase for cash from the other
Banks such portion of each such other Bank's Loans or the Reimbursement
Obligation owing to it, or shall provide such other Banks with the benefits of
any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause
such benefitted Bank to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral
or proceeds ratably with each of the Banks; provided, however, that if all or
any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from
such benefitted Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price
and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.
The Borrower agrees that each Bank so purchasing a portion of another Bank's
Loans or Reimbursement Obligations may exercise all rights of payment
(including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion
as fully as if such Bank were the direct holder of such portion.

(b)  In addition to any rights and remedies, of the Banks
provided by law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each of the Banks
shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice
being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable
law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder or
under the Notes (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise)
to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency,
and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case
whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at
any time held or owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower. Each of the Banks agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided, that
the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off
and application.

9.9   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all
of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the
same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the
parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and each of the Banks.

9.10  Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

9.11  Integration. This Agreement represents the agreement of the
Borrower, the Agent and the Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the
Agent or any Bank relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or
referred to herein or in the Notes or the other Loan Documents.

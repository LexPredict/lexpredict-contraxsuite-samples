If requested by such Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall also submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, renewed, extended or otherwise amended only if (and upon the issuance, renewal, extension or other amendment of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, renewal, extension or other amendment, (i) the total LC Exposure would not exceed $200,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Credit Exposures would not exceed the total Commitments.”

If a Lender agrees, in its sole and absolute discretion, to so extend its Commitment, it will give notice to the Administrative Agent of its decision to do so within 30 days after the Borrower’s delivery of notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders requesting extension of the Current Expiration Date. Promptly after expiration of such 30-day period, the Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower and each Lender as to the Lenders (each an ‘Extending Lender’) from which it has received such a notice agreeing to so extend. Any failure by a Lender to so notify the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be a decision by such Lender not to so extend its Commitment.”


(g)    Section 2.20(d) of the Credit Agreement is amended in full to read as follows:


“(d)    The Borrower may use the process contemplated by this Section 2.20, at any time or times after April 18, 2014, only once for a Requested Extension Period of two years or up to twice for Requested Extension Periods of one year each; provided, however, that no extension of the Expiration Date shall be permitted that would cause the remaining term until the Expiration Date to exceed five years at any time.”

“Section 3.14 Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions. The Borrower has implemented and maintains in effect policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by the Borrower, its Significant Subsidiaries and Ecova (whether or not a Significant Subsidiary), and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, with the Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and their respective officers and employees and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, their respective directors and agents, are in compliance with the Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions in all material respects. None of the following is a Sanctioned Person: (a) the Borrower or any Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, any of their respective directors, officers or employees; or (b) to the knowledge of the Borrower, any agent of the Borrower or any Subsidiary that will benefit from, or act in any capacity in connection with, the credit facility established hereby. No Borrowing, Letter of Credit, use of proceeds of any Borrowing or Letter of Credit, or other transaction contemplated by this Agreement will violate any Anti-Corruption Law or applicable Sanction.”

Upon payment of the applicable amounts to the Exiting Lender, the Exiting Lender shall automatically be deemed to have sold and made the applicable assignments to the Additional Commitment Lenders and shall be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents, and the Additional Commitment Lenders shall automatically be deemed to have purchased and accepted such assignments from the Exiting Lender.


(b)    Without limiting the foregoing, upon the effectiveness of the assignments contemplated by subsection (a) above, (i) the Exiting Lender shall be discharged from its Commitment and other obligations (other than the return of its Note) under the Credit Agreement and shall no longer be a Lender thereunder, (ii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks shall be deemed to have consented to the assignments effected pursuant to subsection (a) above, and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall record the Commitments, Loans, LC Disbursements and LC Participations of each Additional Commitment Lender and the Exiting Lender as provided in Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement to reflect such assignments.


SECTION 5.    Effect of Amendment on Interest and Fee Rates. Changes in interest rates and fee rates effected by this Amendment shall apply with respect to interest and fees accruing on or after the Effective Date, and interest rates and fee rates in effect before the Effective Date shall apply with respect to interest and fees accrued before the Effective Date.


SECTION 6.    Reference to and Effect on Loan Documents.


(a)    On and after the Effective Date, (i) each reference in the Credit Agreement to “this Agreement,” “hereunder,” “hereof,” “herein” or words of like import referring to the Credit Agreement shall mean and be a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended by this Amendment, (ii) each reference in the Credit Agreement to “the First Mortgage Bond,” “thereunder,” “thereof,” “therein” or words of like import referring to the First Mortgage Bond shall mean and be a reference to the New First Mortgage Bond, (iii) each reference in the Credit Agreement to “the Supplemental Indenture,” “thereunder,” “thereof,” “therein” or words of like import referring to the Supplemental Indenture shall mean and be a reference to the New Supplemental Indenture, and (iv) each reference in the Credit Agreement to “the Bond Delivery Agreement,” “thereunder,” “thereof,” “therein” or words of like import referring to the Bond Delivery Agreement shall mean and be a reference to the New Bond Delivery Agreement.


(b)    Except as specifically contemplated by this Amendment, the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby ratified and confirmed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the First Mortgage, as









modified by the New Supplemental Indenture, and all of the collateral described therein do and shall continue to secure the payment of all obligations under the New First Mortgage Bond.


(c)    The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender under any of the Loan Documents or constitute a waiver of any provision of any of the Loan Documents, except as expressly provided herein.


SECTION 7.    Execution in Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Amendment by telecopier or e-mail shall be effective as delivery of an originally executed counterpart of this Amendment.


SECTION 8.    Governing Law. THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF LOANS

Section 2.1  Commitment.

(a)  Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth,
each Lender, severally and not jointly, agrees to make loans (each an "Advance"
and collectively, the

<PAGE>

"Advances") pro rata in accordance with such Lender's Percentage to the Borrower
from time to time on and/or after the Closing Date.

(b)  The Advances made pursuant hereto by the Lenders shall not
exceed an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of the lesser of
(i) $50,000,000 (the "Commitment"), and (ii) the Maximum Availability Amount at
such time. There may not be more than one Advance made on any day. Within the
foregoing limits and subject to the conditions set out in this Agreement, the
Borrower may borrow Advances under this Section 2.1, repay Advances under
Section 2.8, and reborrow Advances.

(c)  The aggregate principal amount of each Advance hereunder
shall be not less than $500,000 and shall be in integral multiples of $100,000.

Section 2.2 Advances. (a) The Lenders will make Advances of the Loan
for (and only for) any Permitted Purpose subject to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, subject
to satisfaction of all conditions precedent to Advances set forth herein.

(b)  The initial Advance of the loan proceeds will be made upon
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article III of this Agreement, and
all subsequent advances shall be made no more frequently than (1) twice during
any calendar month thereafter and (2) once every 12 days.

Section 2.3  Notices of Borrowing. Whenever the Borrower desires to
receive an Advance hereunder, it shall give the Agent at least five Business
Days' prior written notice of the proposed Advance to be made hereunder, such
notice to be given prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) on the date specified.
Each such notice (each a "Notice of Borrowing") shall be in the form of Exhibit
B, be irrevocable, and specify the principal amount of the Advance to be made
and the date (which shall be a Business Day) of the Advance.

Section 2.4  Disbursement of Funds. The Agent shall promptly (but in
no event less than three Business Days prior to the date of the Advance) notify
each Lender of its Percentage of each Advance and the date of such Advance. On
the date so specified, each Lender shall make available to the Agent at the
Payment Office no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) in immediately available
funds an amount equal to such Lender's Percentage of such Advance. No later than
1:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date of each Advance, the Agent will make
available to the Borrower at the Payment Office the full amount of the Advance.

<PAGE>

Section 2.5  Promissory Notes; Collateral.

(a)  The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest
on, the Advances made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more
Promissory Notes in the face amount of each such Lender's Percentage of the
Commitment, with blanks as to payee, date and principal amount appropriately
completed. The determination by the Agent of the amount of principal outstanding
hereunder or under any Promissory Note shall, except for patent error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Borrower for all purposes.

(b)  Each borrowing, prepayment and reborrowing hereunder shall be
recorded by the Agent; provided, however, that no failure to make or error in
making a recordation of an Advance shall in any way limit, affect or modify the
obligation of the Borrower to repay any obligations, or the rights of the Agent
and the Lenders to any amounts due under this Agreement, the Loan Documents and
the Promissory Notes.

(c)  Except as otherwise set forth in the Loan Documents, each item of
Collateral shall secure the payment and performance of all indebtedness and
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, including without limitation,
any increased cost under Section 2.14 hereof, and each other Loan Document.

Section 2.6  Interest on Advances.

(a)  The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid
principal amount of each Advance from the date such Advance is made at a rate
per annum for each Interest Period equal to the Applicable Margin plus the
relevant Adjusted Eurodollar Rate. Interest on each Advance shall accrue from
and including the date of such Advance to but excluding the date of any
repayment thereof and shall be payable (i) (x) with respect to all Advances
other than Advances the Interest Period applicable to which is six months, in
arrears on the last day of the Interest Period for each such Advance, and (y)
with respect to all Advances the Interest Period applicable to which is six
months, in arrears on the 90th day following the first day of such Interest
Period and on the last day of such Interest Period, (ii) at maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise), and (iii) after maturity, on demand. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, interest on each Advance bearing interest at the Alternate Rate
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be payable in arrears on the last
day of each calendar month during the Interest Period applicable to such Advance
and on the last day of such Interest Period, (ii) at maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise), and (iii) after maturity, on demand.

(b)  Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest in respect of each Advance, and all other overdue amounts owing
hereunder, shall bear

<PAGE>

interest for each day that such amounts are overdue at a rate (the "Default
Rate") per annum equal to three percent per annum plus the interest rate
otherwise applicable thereto from the first day such amounts are overdue to but
excluding the date such overdue amounts are paid.

(c)  The Agent, upon determining the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for any
Interest Period, shall promptly notify by telephone (confirmed in writing) or in
writing the Borrower thereof.

(d)  It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of the
Lenders and Borrower at all times to comply with the applicable law governing
the highest lawful interest rate. If the applicable law is ever judicially
interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under this Agreement
or under any of the other Loan Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken,
reserved or received with respect to the Indebtedness evidenced thereby, or if
acceleration of the maturity of the obligations, or the rights of the Agent and
the Lenders to any amounts due, under this Agreement, the Loan Documents and the
Promissory Notes, any prepayment by Borrower, or any other circumstance
whatsoever, results in Borrower having paid any interest, penalty, fee or other
amount in excess of that permitted by applicable law, then it is the express
intent of Borrower and Lenders that all excess amounts theretofore collected by
Lenders be credited on the principal balance of the Advances (or, at Lenders'
option, paid over to Borrower), and the provisions of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter
collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the
execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so
as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder
and thereunder. The right to accelerate maturity of the obligations, or the
rights of the Agent and the Lenders to any amounts due, under this Agreement,
the Loan Documents and the Promissory Notes, does not include the right to
accelerate any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such
acceleration, and Lenders do not intend to collect any unearned interest in the
event of acceleration. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders for the
use, forbearance or detention of the obligations, or the rights of the Agent and
the Lenders to any amounts due, under this Agreement, the Loan Documents and the
Promissory Notes shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such obligations and
amounts until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account
of such secured obligations does not exceed the maximum rate or amount of
interest permitted under applicable law.

Section 2.7  Interest Periods. In connection with each Advance bearing
interest at the rate described in Section

<PAGE>

2.6(a) above, an interest period (each an "Interest Period") shall be applicable
thereto, which shall be a period of one, two, three or six months as selected by
the Borrower in the Notice of Borrowing for such Advance, provided that:

(i)   the initial Interest Period for any Advance shall
commence on the date of such Advance;

(ii)  subject to the provisions of Section 6.2 hereof and
provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, at the end of the initial Interest Period, and each
subsequent Interest Period for any Advance, the Borrower shall be
permitted to select an additional Interest Period for such Advance by
delivering a written notice thereof, in the form of Exhibit B-1, to
the Agent at any time prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) on the third
Business Day prior to the expiration of the then current Interest
Period applicable to such Advance, provided that if no Interest Period
selection is delivered to the Agent by such time, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month and such
Interest Period selected or deemed to have been selected for such
Advance may not be changed without the consent of the Agent;

(iii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the
next succeeding Business Day, provided that if any Interest Period in
respect of an Advance (other than an Advance referred to in Section
2.13(b)(ii) or Section 2.14(b)(ii)) would otherwise expire on a day
that is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no
further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall
expire on the next preceding Business Day;

(iv)  any Interest Period in respect of an Advance which
begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for
which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month
at the end of such Interest Period) shall, subject to clause (v)
below, end on the last Business Day of a calendar month;

(v)   no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Maturity
Date; and

(vi)  there shall be no more than six Interest Periods in
effect at any time.

Section 2.8  Repayment of Advances. The Borrower shall repay to the
Agent, for the account of the Lenders, the unpaid principal amount of each
Advance made by the Lenders

<PAGE>

hereunder, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other
sums due and payable to the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
on the Maturity Date.

Section 2.9  Prepayments of Advances.

(a)  The Borrower may prepay all outstanding Advances, any one Advance
or portion thereof on any Business Day without penalty, premium or additional
charge, except as set forth in Section 2.16 hereof; provided such prepayment
shall be at least equal to the lesser of $100,000 or the outstanding amount of
such Advance.  Upon three (3) days written notice to the Agent, the Borrower may
terminate the Commitment by prepaying all outstanding Advances and all other
amounts and fees due to the Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.

(b)  The Borrower shall be liable for all amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.16 with respect to a prepayment of an Advance on any date other than
the last day of the Interest Period related to such Advance where no new
Interest Period shall have been selected or deemed to have been selected
pursuant to Section 2.7(ii) for such Advance.

Section 2.10  Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
account of the Lenders a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") equal to 0.325%
per annum on the Average Undrawn Balance of the Commitment. Such Commitment Fee
shall be due and payable (i) quarterly in arrears on the last day of each
calendar quarter, and (ii) on the Maturity Date. Each payment on account of the
Commitment Fee for a period which is less than a full calendar quarter shall be
prorated.

Section 2.11  Payments, Etc.

(a)  All payments under this Agreement shall be pro rata among the
Lenders in accordance with their Percentages and shall be made by the Borrower,
without defense, setoff, or counterclaim, to the Agent not later than 12:00 noon
(New York time) on the date when due and shall be made in Dollars in immediately
available funds at the Payment Office and any funds received by the Agent after
such time shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to have been paid
on the next succeeding Business Day.  The Agent shall thereafter cause to be
distributed to the Lenders, on the Business Day when paid, in like funds their
Percentage of payments so received.

(b)  Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under the Promissory
Notes shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due
date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (unless the
relevant Interest Period expires on the next preceding Business Day pursuant to
Section 2.7(iii), in which case the due date shall be

<PAGE>

the next preceding Business Day) and, with respect to payments of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable rate during such extension.

(c)  All computations of interest on the Advances shall be made on the
basis of a year of (x) in the case of Advances on which interest is computed on
the basis of the Eurodollar Rate, 360 days, and (y) in the case of Advances on
which interest is computed on the basis of the Alternate Rate,  365/366 days, in
either case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding
the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable.

Section 2.12  Interest Rate Not Ascertainable, Etc.  If the Agent
shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Borrower) that on any date for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any
Interest Period, by reason of any circumstances affecting the interbank
Eurodollar market generally, adequate and fair means do not exist for
ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the
definition of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, then, and in any such event, the Agent
shall forthwith give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower
of such determination.  Until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to the suspension described herein no longer exist:

(i)  any Advance made hereunder shall bear interest at the
then applicable Alternate Rate; and

(ii) if any Advance affected is then outstanding, each such
Advance shall immediately convert into an Advance bearing interest at
the then applicable Alternate Rate with an Interest Period ending on
the date on which the Interest Period applicable to the Advance
affected expires.

Section 2.13  Illegality.

(a)  If any Lender (a "Notifying Lender") shall have determined
at any time that the making or continuance of any Advance has become unlawful by
compliance by such Lender in good faith with any applicable Requirement of Law
adopted or becoming effective after the date hereof, then, in any such event,
the Notifying Lender shall give prompt notice (by telephone confirmed in
writing) to the Agent and the Borrower of such determination.

(b)  Upon the giving of the notice to the Agent and the Borrower
referred to in subsection (a) above, (i) the Borrower's right to request and the
Notifying Lender's obligation to make Advances shall be immediately suspended,
and (ii) if any Advance of the Notifying Lender affected thereby is then
outstanding, each such Advance shall immediately convert into an

<PAGE>

Advance bearing interest at the then applicable Alternate Rate with an Interest
Period ending on the date on which the Interest Period applicable to the Advance
affected expires.

Section 2.14  Increased Costs.

(a)  If, by reason of (x) after the date hereof, the implementation of
or any change (including, without limitation, any change by way of imposition or
increase of reserve or capital adequacy requirements) in, or in the
interpretation by any Governmental Authority or any other recognized authority
of, any law or regulation, or (y) the compliance with any guideline or request
from any central bank or other Governmental Authority or quasi-Governmental
Authority exercising control over banks or financial institutions generally
(whether or not having the force of law) adopted or becoming effective after the
date hereof:

(i)  any Lender (or its Lending Office) shall be subject to
any tax, duty, or other charge, with respect to the Advances or its
obligation to make Advances, or shall change the basis of taxation of
payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on the Advances
or its obligation to make Advances (except for changes in the rate of
tax on the overall net income of such Lender or its Lending Office
imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's principal executive
office or Lending Office is located); or

(ii) any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement
(including, without limitation, any reserve, special deposit, or
similar requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System) against assets of, deposits with or for the account
of, or credit extended by, any Lender or its Lending Office shall be
imposed or deemed applicable or any other condition affecting the
Advances shall be imposed on such Lender or its Lending Office or the
interbank Eurodollar market;

and as a result thereof there shall be any cost to such Lender of agreeing to
make or maintain the Advances, or there shall be a reduction in the amount
received or receivable by such Lender or its Lending Office, then the Borrower
shall from time to time, upon written notice and demand (including such Lender's
reasonable details with respect to such increased cost) promptly given by the
Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, within five Business
Days after the date specified in such notice and demand, additional amounts
sufficient to indemnify such Lender against such increased cost. In the event
that a Lender becomes aware of the imposition of a cost to such Lender or a
reduction in the amount to be received or receivable by such Lender or its
Lending Office which is an additional cost

<PAGE>

pursuant to this Section 2.14, such Lender shall promptly notify the Agent and
the Borrower in writing of such imposition or reduction, which notice shall
include such Lender's reasonable details with respect to such increased cost.
With respect to costs or reductions incurred by a Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.14 relating to any period in which the Commitment is in effect, the
provisions of this Section 2.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the Promissory Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b)  If the Lenders shall notify the Borrower in writing that at
any time, because of the circumstances described in clause (x) or (y) in Section
2.14(a) or any other circumstances arising after the Closing Date and relating
to any period in which the Commitment is in effect affecting the interbank
Eurodollar market generally, the then applicable Adjusted Eurodollar Rate, as
determined by the Agent, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the
Lenders of funding the Advances, then, subject to Section 2.14(c), thereafter:

(i)  any Advance made hereunder shall bear interest at
the Alternate Rate; and

(ii) if the affected Advance is then outstanding, the
Borrower shall immediately, or if permitted by applicable law, no
later than the date permitted thereby, upon at least one Business
Day's written notice to the Lenders, convert each such Advance into an
Advance bearing interest at the Alternate Rate with an Interest Period
ending on the date on which the Interest Period applicable to the
affected Advance expires.

(c)  If the Lenders shall notify the Borrower in writing that at
any time, because of the circumstances described in clause (x) or (y) in Section
2.14(a) or any other circumstances arising after the Closing Date and relating
to any period in which the Commitment is in effect affecting the interbank
Eurodollar market generally, then the Borrower shall be entitled to require each
Lender to which such circumstances apply to assign its Credit Exposure at par to
any Person selected by Borrower that is a financial institution reasonably
acceptable to the Agent, which assignment shall be effected pursuant to Section
7.18 hereof.

Section 2.15  Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that it
will use reasonable efforts to designate an alternate Lending Office with
respect to its Advances affected by the matters or circumstances described in
Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14 to reduce the liability of the Borrower or avoid the
results provided thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous
to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion.

<PAGE>

Section 2.16  Funding Losses.  The Borrower shall compensate each
Lender, upon such Lender's written request to the Agent and the Agent's delivery
thereof to the Borrower (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for requesting such amounts), for all losses, expenses, and liabilities
(including, without limitation, any interest paid by such Lender to lenders of
funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Advances to the extent not recovered
by such Lender in connection with the re-employment of such funds but excluding
loss of anticipated profits), which such Lender may sustain:  (i) if for any
reason (other than a default by such Lender) an Advance does not occur on the
date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing (whether or not withdrawn);
(ii) if any repayment of any Advance occurs on a date which is not the Maturity
Date or the last day of an Interest Period applicable to such Advance (subject
to Section 2.9(b)); (iii) if, for any reason, the Borrower defaults in its
obligation to repay any Advances when required by the terms of this Agreement;
or (iv) the occurrence of any of the events described in Sections 2.12, 2.13 or
2.15.  With respect to losses, expenses and liabilities which a Lender may
sustain as described in this Section 2.16 relating to any period in which the
Commitment is in effect, the provisions of this Section 2.16 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Promissory Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

Section 2.17  Taxes.  (a)
All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement and the Promissory
Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for
or on account of, any present or future income, stamp, or other taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, reserves or withholdings, now or
hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental
Authority, excluding in the case of each Lender, net income taxes and franchise
taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on such Lender as a result
of a present or former connection between the jurisdiction of the government or
taxing authority imposing such tax and such Lender (excluding a connection
arising solely from such Lender having executed, delivered, or performed its
obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or the
Promissory Notes) or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions and withholdings being hereinafter called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are
required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Lender hereunder or
under the Promissory Notes, the amounts so payable to such Lender shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Lender (after payment of all
Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in
the amounts specified in this Agreement and the appropriate Promissory Note.
Whenever any Taxes are payable by the Borrower pursuant to applicable law, as
promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Agent a


<PAGE>

certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing
payment thereof. If any Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the
appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Agent the required
receipts or other required documentary evidence (other than any such failure due
to failure of any Lender to furnish the documents required to be furnished by
such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(b)), the Borrower shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Agent and each Lender for any incremental taxes, interest,
or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of
any such failure. With respect to any obligations of the Borrower pursuant to
this Section 2.17 relating to any period in which the Commitment is in effect,
the agreements in this Section 2.17, as they apply to any Advance, shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Promissory Notes and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b) Agent and each Lender shall furnish Borrower, at least 30
days prior to the date on which the first payment to each Lender (including each
Purchasing Lender) is due, and annually thereafter during the term of the Loan,
with United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001, 4224, W-8 or W-9 (or any
other successor form) or any other document evidencing such Lender's exemption
from withholding of Taxes from any amounts payable to such Lender hereunder
under as of the Closing Date. If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any
amounts payable to any Lender hereunder or under the Promissory Notes, then the
Borrower shall be entitled to require such Lender to assign its Credit Exposure
at par to any Person selected by Borrower that is a financial institution
reasonably acceptable to the Agent, which assignment shall be effected pursuant
to Section 7.18 hereof.

Section 2.18  Extension of Maturity Date.  At least sixty (60) days
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrower may, by notice
to Agent, request that Agent and each Lender review whether or not it is willing
to extend the Maturity Date.  In the event and to the extent that the Agent and
all of the Required Lenders agree, in their respective sole and absolute
discretion, to extend the Maturity Date on such terms and conditions as shall be
acceptable to the Agent and all of the Required Lenders, in their respective
sole and absolute discretion, then the Agent shall so advise the Borrower.  If
the terms and conditions to such extension are acceptable to Borrower, in its
sole and absolute discretion, then the Borrower shall so notify the Agent within
the time period set forth in such notice to the Borrower and, provided that all
of the conditions to the effectiveness of such extension as set forth in such
notice to the Borrower are satisfied, the Maturity Date shall be extended
pursuant to such terms and conditions and the provisions of this Section.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary, the Agent and
each Lender shall have the right to refuse to extend the Maturity Date for any
reason or for no reason whatsoever.  If the Maturity Date is

<PAGE>

extended pursuant to this Section but less than all of the Lenders agree to such
extension, then either (i) the Commitment, for all purposes during the period of
such extension, shall be equal to the product of the Commitment times the
aggregate Percentage of the Lenders agreeing to such extension, or (ii) the
Borrower shall be entitled to require each Lender which does not agree to such
extension to assign its Credit Exposure at par to any Person selected by
Borrower that is a financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Agent,
which assignment shall be effected pursuant to Section 7.18 hereof.

business as is now or is proposed to be conducted (unless the failure to have
same would not constitute a Material Adverse Change).

Section 4.2   Authorization of Agreement; No Violation.  The
execution, delivery, and performance by Borrower of this Agreement and of the
Loan Documents (i) are within the Borrower's powers, (ii) have been duly
authorized by all necessary action, and (iii) do not violate or create a default
under any Requirement of Law, the Borrower's Certificate of Incorporation and

other action by, and no notice to or filing or registration with, any

best knowledge of the Borrower, threatened with the National Labor Relations

complaints pending or in process or, to the best knowledge of Borrower,
threatened by or on behalf of any employee or group of employees of the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries

Material Adverse Change.

(f) There are no complaints or charges against the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries pending or, to the best knowledge of Borrower, threatened to be

all laws, and all orders of any court, governmental agency or arbitrator,
relating to the employment of labor, including all such laws relating to wages,
hours, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, and the payment of

could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Change.  No claim
has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the
use of any such Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any
such Intellectual Property, nor does the Borrower know of any valid basis for
any such claim (other than claims which would not constitute a Material Adverse
Change).  The use of such Intellectual Property by the Borrower does not

that, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Change.

Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity of which are
currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which adequate reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on
the books of Borrower). No tax Lien has been filed which could constitute a Lien

relates are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings which have

written notice from the insurance carrier to the Agent, or, in any other
circumstance, at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice from the insurance
carrier to the Agent; and (ii) no act or thing done by the

<PAGE>

Borrower, or any Affiliate of any of Borrower shall invalidate the policy as

agreement or arrangement of any nature whatsoever, except Permitted
Encumbrances.  Borrower shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary Mortgagor to,

any part thereof or that any improvements located on such Mortgaged Property
cannot be operated in accordance with its intended use or is in violation of
applicable Use Requirements.

(c) The Mortgage covering each such Mortgaged Property creates a valid

to such property.

(d) The Collateral is now, and so long as the Commitment remains in

owned solely by the Borrower, and said Collateral, including the proceeds
resulting from the sale or other disposition (other than Permitted Transfers of
the Mortgaged Property) thereof, is and will remain free and clear of any Liens
except the Liens granted pursuant to the Loan Documents to the Agent and the
Lenders, which Liens to the Agent and the Lenders shall, at all times, be first

disposition thereof, and no further action need be taken to perfect said Liens.

Mortgaged Property as an extended stay facility, is to any extent dependent upon
or related to any other real estate.  Each Mortgaged Property may be operated as

Property, in any such case not accounted for in the Plans and Specifications.

water, gas, and electrical supply, storm, and sanitary sewerage facilities,
other required public utilities (with respect to each of the aforementioned

such Mortgaged Property), parking, and means of access between such Mortgaged
Property and public highways over recognized curb cuts, and all of the foregoing

payments to (including, without limitation, on account of any management fees,
service fees, office charges, consulting fees, technical service charges, or tax
sharing charges) or otherwise deal with, in the ordinary course of business or
otherwise, any Affiliate on terms other than arm's-length commercially
reasonable terms (other than (i) any such transactions in effect on the Closing
Date and described in Schedule 7 attached hereto, and (ii) any such transactions
between the Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries and between Subsidiaries of
Borrower).

(l) Use of Proceeds. Use the proceeds of the Advances for other than
any Permitted Purpose.

(m) Change of Business. Make or allow any material change in the
nature or scope of the business of the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

<PAGE>

(n) Hazardous Materials.  Subject to the provisions of Section
5.5 hereof:

(i) Use or permit or suffer use of any Mortgaged Property or
any part thereof or any interest therein or conduct any activity or
operations thereon in any manner which:

(A)  would involve or result in the occurrence or
presence of or exposure to Hazardous Materials at, upon, under,
across or within any Mortgaged Property or any part thereof not
in the ordinary course of operation;

(B)  would violate any Relevant Environmental Laws; or

(C)  would result in the occurrence of any
Environmental Discharge.

(ii) Install or suffer or permit installation or Presence
on, in or under any Mortgaged Property or any part thereof of any
underground or above-ground containers for the storage of fuel oil,
gasoline or other petroleum products or by-products, except (i) such
above-ground containers that are required for the operation of the
Mortgaged Property and that are at all times in compliance with all
Relevant Environmental Laws and any other applicable Requirements of
Law and (ii) such underground containers that are required for the
operation of the Mortgaged Property and are at all times in compliance
with all Relevant Environmental Laws and any other applicable
Requirements of Law.

Section 5.4  Material Casualties.  The Borrower agrees that if at any
time prior to the repayment in full of the Advances and the termination of the
Commitment (including, but not limited to, at any time, prior to or after an
Event of Default) any Mortgaged Property is damaged by fire, earthquake or other
casualty in such a manner or to such an extent so that it is unlikely, in the
Agent's reasonable judgment, that such Mortgaged Property will be restored on or
prior to the Maturity Date to the same physical, leased and operating condition
as it exists prior to such casualty, the Borrower shall, within twenty (20) days
of the Agent's written request, direct that the insurance proceeds from the
casualty be delivered over to the Agent, to be applied by the Agent to repayment
of or the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

Section 5.5  Effect of Certain Representations or Covenants Being
Inaccurate or Breached.  In the event that any of

<PAGE>

the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.11, 4.17, 4.18, 4.22,
4.24, 4.25, 4.27 and 4.28 of this Agreement (or any representation or warranty
contained in any other Loan Document which is substantially similar to any of
the foregoing representations and warranties) are not accurate when made or
deemed made, or in the event that any of the covenants contained in Sections
5.1(d), (e)(ii), (i), (j), (k), (l) and (n) and 5.3(n) (or any covenant
contained in any other Loan Document which is substantially similar to any of
the foregoing covenants) are breached, then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, such breach or inaccuracy shall not constitute or be deemed a Default
or Event of Default, and Borrower shall not be deemed to have made any
misrepresentation, or breached any warranty or covenant unless and until (but
shall, at Agent's option, constitute and be deemed a Default and Event of
Default, and Borrower shall be deemed to have made such misrepresentation, or
breached such warranty or covenant, if and when):

(a)  (i)  Borrower is given notice of the circumstances which, but for
this Section 5.5, would constitute such misrepresentation,
or breach of warranty or covenant and such circumstances are
not remediated (i.e, the circumstances which would otherwise
constitute such misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant no longer exist) within (1) in the case of
circumstances which can be remediated by the payment of a
sum of money only, 10 days after such notice is given, and
(2) in the case of all other circumstances, 30 days after
such notice is given plus, if such circumstances cannot
reasonably be remediated within 30 days after such notice is
given and the Borrower has during such 30-day period
commenced to remediate such circumstances and thereafter
diligently pursues all necessary efforts to effect such
remediation, such additional period of time as may be
required to effect such remediation; provided, however, that
if at any time during any cure period described above
regarding circumstances the cost to remediate which are
quantifiable, Borrower shall not have provided evidence
satisfactory to the Agent that the Borrower has available to
it sufficient funds (other than from borrowings pursuant to
this Agreement) to promptly effect any such remediation,
then the cure period provided for above regarding such
circumstances shall immediately expire; and

<PAGE>

(ii)    upon the expiration of the applicable cure period described
in Section 5.5(a)(i), if such circumstances have not been
remediated, the aggregate principal amount of all
outstanding Advances at such time exceeds the "Eligible
Maximum Availability Amount", as herein defined, at such
time.  The term "Remediation Amount" means the amount which
Borrower certifies to Agent in writing (Borrower hereby
agreeing to so certify such amount promptly upon Agent's
request) as being Borrower's reasonable estimate (determined
in a manner reasonably acceptable to Agent, the basis for
which determination shall be set forth in reasonable detail
in such certification) of the aggregate cost of remediating
all circumstances which would constitute a misrepresentation
or breach of warranty or covenant of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants described above in
this Section 5.5.  The term "Eligible Maximum Availability
Amount" means, as of the date of expiration of such
applicable cure period, the Maximum Availability Amount as
of such date recomputed by subtracting from the Eligible
Costs as of such date the amount by which the Remediation
Amount exceeds, if at all, the lesser of (x) $3,000,000.00,
and (y) the greater of (A) $300,000.00, and (B) 3% of the
Eligible Costs as of such date; provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Advances shall not at any time
exceed the lesser of (i) the Commitment, and (ii) the
Maximum Availability Amount at such time; or

(b)  all circumstances which would constitute a
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants described above in this
Section 5.5, when taken as a whole, constitute a Material Adverse
Change.

In the event that any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant with
respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties occurs which, pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 5.5, constitutes or will constitute a Default and
Event of Default, then, subject to the terms hereof, Borrower shall have the
right to substitute for such affected Mortgaged Properties one or more other
properties of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, provided that (i) all of such
proposed substitute properties are acceptable in all respects to the Agent in
its sole, absolute and subjective discretion, (ii) all other conditions herein
to a

<PAGE>

property becoming a Mortgaged Property are satisfied and complied with, and
(iii) both before and after giving effect to such proposed substitution, no
Default or Event of Default (other than as a result of such misrepresentation or
breach of warranty or covenant) shall exist.


ARTICLE VI

EVENTS OF DEFAULT

Section 6.1 Events of Default. The occurrence and continuance of any of the
following specified events shall constitute an "Event of Default":

(a) Payments.  The Borrower shall fail to pay (i) any principal of the
Advances hereunder when due, or (ii) within three (3) days when due (including,
without limitation, by mandatory prepayment) (1) any interest on any of the
Advances or any fees or (2) any other amount payable hereunder or under the
other Loan Documents.

(b) Certain Property Representations and Covenants. Any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant occurs which, pursuant to
the provisions of Section 5.5 hereof, constitutes a Default and Event of
Default.

(c) Other Covenants.  The Borrower shall fail to observe or perform
any covenant or agreement (other than those referred to in Sections 6.1(a) and
(b)) and such failure shall remain unremedied (i) in the case of any amounts
payable hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, for 3 days after notice
from the Agent, (ii) in the case of covenants or agreements contained in Section
5.2(a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Agreement, for 20 Business Days after the
occurrence thereof; or (iii) in all other cases, for 30 days after the
occurrence thereof.  In the event that a breach of a covenant described in
clause (iii) above cannot be cured within 30 days after the occurrence thereof
and the Borrower has during such 30-day period commenced to cure such breach and
thereafter diligently pursues all necessary efforts to effect a cure, an Event
of Default shall be deemed only to have occurred if the breach either cannot be
remedied, or remains unremedied, for 60 days after the occurrence thereof.

(d) Representations.   Any representation, warranty, or statement
(other than those referred to in Section 6.1(b)) made or deemed to be made by
the Borrower or any other Person (other than the Agent or any Lender) that is a
party to any Loan Document under or in connection with any Loan Document shall
have been incorrect in any material respect as of the date hereof, or as of the
date deemed to have been made.

<PAGE>

(e) Non-Payments of Other Indebtedness.  The Borrower shall fail to
make any payment of principal of or interest on any Indebtedness of the Borrower
(other than any Indebtedness under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
and other than Permissible Assumed Indebtedness) in an aggregate principal
amount of not less than $5,000,000.00 within the applicable cure period or any
event specified in any note, agreement, indenture or other document evidencing
or relating to any such Indebtedness shall occur; and the effect of such failure
or event is to accelerate, or to permit the holder of such aggregate
Indebtedness or any other Person to accelerate, the maturity of such
Indebtedness; or such Indebtedness shall be required to be prepaid (other than
by a regularly scheduled required prepayment) in whole or in part prior to its
stated maturity.

(f) Defaults Under Loan Documents.  The Borrower or any other Person
(other than the Agent or any Lender) that is a party to any Loan Document shall
fail to observe or perform any covenant or agreement (other than those referred
to in Sections 6.1(a) and (b)) contained in any other Loan Document, or any
default shall occur under any other Loan Document (other than those referred to
in Sections 6.1(a) and (b)) and such failure or default shall remain unremedied
(i) in the case of any amounts payable under the other Loan Documents, for 3
days after notice from the Agent, (ii) in the case of covenants or agreements
similar to the covenants or agreements contained in Section 5.2(a), (b), (c) and
(d) of this Agreement, for 20 Business Days after the occurrence thereof; or
(iii) in all other cases, for 30 days after the occurrence thereof.  In the
event that a breach of a covenant described in clause (iii) above cannot be
cured within 30 days after the occurrence thereof and the Borrower or such other
Person has during such 30-day period commenced to cure such breach and
thereafter diligently pursues all necessary efforts to effect a cure, an Event
of Default shall be deemed only to have occurred if the breach either cannot be
remedied, or remains unremedied, for 60 days after the occurrence thereof.

(g) Bankruptcy.  The Borrower shall commence a voluntary case
concerning itself under Title 11 of the United States Code entitled "Bankruptcy"
as now or hereafter in effect, or any successor thereto (the "Bankruptcy Code");
or an involuntary case is commenced against the Borrower and the petition is not
dismissed within 90 days, after commencement of the case; or a custodian (as
defined in the Bankruptcy Code) is appointed for, or takes charge of, all or any
substantial part of the property of the Borrower; or the Borrower commences any
other proceeding under any reorganization, arrangement, adjustment of debt,
relief of debtors, dissolution, insolvency, or liquidation or similar law of any
jurisdiction whether now or hereafter in effect relating to the Borrower or
there is commenced against the Borrower any such proceeding which remains
undismissed for a period of 90 days; or the Borrower is adjudicated insolvent or

<PAGE>

bankrupt; or any order of relief or other order approving any such case or
proceeding is entered; or the Borrower suffers any appointment of any custodian
or the like for it or any substantial part of its property to continue
undischarged or unstayed for a period of 90 days; or the Borrower makes a
general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or the Borrower shall fail to
pay, or shall state that it is unable to pay, or shall be unable to pay, its
debts generally as they become due; or the Borrower shall call a meeting of its
creditors with a view to arranging a composition or adjustment of its debts; or
the Borrower shall by any act or failure to act indicate its consent to,
approval of, or acquiescence in any of the foregoing; or any action is taken by
the Borrower for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; or any of the
foregoing shall occur with respect to any Subsidiary Mortgagor.

(h) Money Judgement.  A judgment or order for the payment of money in
excess of $5,000,000 shall be rendered against the Borrower and such judgment or
order shall continue unsatisfied (in the case of a money judgment) and in effect
for a period of 30 days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed
or deferred (whether by action of a court, by agreement, or otherwise) (or, if
such judgment is covered by insurance, such longer period during which the
Borrower is appealing or otherwise contesting such judgment in good faith).

Section 6.2  Global Remedies.  Upon the occurrence and continuation of
an Event of Default, and at any time thereafter, if any Event of Default shall
then be continuing, the Lenders may, by written notice to the Borrower, take any
or all of the following actions, without prejudice to the rights of the Lenders
to enforce its claims against the Borrower:  (i) declare the Commitment
terminated, whereupon the Commitment shall terminate immediately; (ii) declare
all or any portion of the principal of and any accrued interest on the Advances
and all other obligations owing hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, to
be, whereupon the same shall become, forthwith due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest, or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby waived by the Borrower; (iii) foreclose on any Collateral concurrently or
in such order as the Agent may from time to time see fit; or (iv) take any
action permitted under any Loan Document; provided, that, if any Event of
Default specified in Section 6.1(g) shall occur, the actions specified in
clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be deemed to have immediately and automatically
occurred without the giving of any notice to the Borrower.

Section 6.3 Marshalling; Waiver of Certain Rights; Recapture. Neither the
Agent nor the Lenders shall be under any obligation to marshall any assets in
favor of the Borrower or any other party or against or in payment of any or all
of the obligations of such parties. To the extent permitted by law the Borrower
waives and renounces the benefit of all valuation,

<PAGE>

appraisement, homestead, exemption, stay, redemption, and moratorium rights
under or by virtue of the constitution and laws of the state in which the
Mortgaged Properties are located and of any other state or of the United States,
now existing or hereafter enacted.  To the extent the Agent or any Lender
receives any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower, which payment or any part
thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside or required to be repaid to the Borrower or its estate, trustee,
receiver, custodian, or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or
federal law, common law, or equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment
or repayment, the obligation or part thereof which has been paid, reduced, or
satisfied by the amount so repaid shall be reinstated by the amount so repaid
and shall be included within the liabilities of the Borrower to such party as of
the date such initial payment, reduction, or satisfaction occurred, together
with interest at the Default Rate.  The Borrower agrees that (i) the Agent on
behalf of the Lenders shall have the right to pursue all of its rights and
remedies in one proceeding, or separately and independently in separate
proceedings from time to time, as the Agent, in its sole and absolute
discretion, shall determine from time to time, (ii) the Collateral may be sold
at such proceeding or proceedings in one or more sales and in such portions or
combinations as the Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine,
(iii) the Agent on behalf of the Lenders shall not be required to marshall
assets, sell any of the Collateral in any inverse order of alienation, or be
subject to any "one action" or "election of remedies" law or rule, (iv) the
exercise by the Lenders of any remedies against any one item of Collateral will
not impede the Lenders from subsequently or simultaneously exercising remedies
against any other item of Collateral, and (v) all Liens and other rights,
remedies, or privileges provided to the Agent and the Lenders under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect
until the Agent and the Lenders have exhausted all of their remedies against the
Collateral and all of the Collateral has been foreclosed, sold or otherwise
realized upon in satisfaction of the Promissory Notes and the other obligations
of the Borrower to the Agent and the Lenders.  Each Lender and its officers,
directors, shareholders, employees, counsel and agents shall not incur any
liability as a result of the sale of the Collateral, or any part thereof, in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Document, or for
the failure to sell or offer for sale the Collateral, or any part thereof, for
any reason whatsoever.  The Borrower waives any claims against each Lender and
its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, counsel and agents arising
with respect to the price at which the Collateral, or any part thereof, may have
been sold by reason of the fact that such price was less than the aggregate
amount of the indebtedness due under the Promissory Notes, this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents.

<PAGE>

Section 6.4  Application of Proceeds. (a) All proceeds received by the
Agent or the Lenders in respect of the repayment of any sums due hereunder or in
connection with a foreclosure sale of all or any portion of the Collateral after
the occurrence of an Event of Default shall be applied, first, to the costs of
enforcement of the Lenders' rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents;
second, to pay any accrued and unpaid interest (including all interest owing at
the Default Rate), the principal amount of the Advances and any unpaid fees
payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in such order of
priority as the Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion shall determine but
subject to the rights of the Lenders; and third, if any excess proceeds exist,
to the Borrower or any party entitled thereto as a matter of law.  If the amount
of all proceeds received in liquidation of the Collateral which shall be applied
to payment of the indebtedness due in respect of this Agreement, the Promissory
Notes and the Loan Documents shall be insufficient to pay all such indebtedness
or obligations in full, the Borrower acknowledges that it shall remain liable
for any deficiency, together with interest thereon and costs of collection
thereof (including reasonable counsel fees and legal expenses).

(b) The Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deposit
any proceeds in its possession which are available under clause third of Section
6.4(a) above into a court of competent jurisdiction for determination by such
court of the disposition of such excess proceeds and upon such deposit, the
Agent shall have no further liability with respect to such proceeds.  All costs
and expenses of the Agent in connection with such action may be deducted or
charged by the Agent against such excess proceeds and shall otherwise be
reimbursed by the Borrower upon demand.  The Agent shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to request and rely on the instructions of the Borrower in
connection with the disposition of any such excess proceeds and, upon compliance
with such instructions, shall have no further liability with respect to such
proceeds.

Section 6.5  Attorneys-in-Fact.  The Borrower hereby makes,
constitutes and appoints the Agent, and its agents and designees, the true and
lawful agents and attorneys-in-fact of the Borrower, with full power of
substitution, to take any or all of the following actions during the continuance
of an Event of Default:  (i) to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed
to the Borrower relating to the Collateral, (ii) to notify and direct the United
States Post Office authorities by notice given in the name of the Borrower and
signed on its behalf, to change the address for delivery of all mail addressed
to the Borrower relating to the Collateral to an address to be designated by the
Agent, and to cause such mail to be delivered to such designated address where
the Agent may open all such mail and remove therefrom any notes, checks,
acceptances, drafts, money orders or other instruments in payment of the
Collateral in which the Agent

<PAGE>

has a security interest hereunder and any documents relative thereto, with full
power to endorse the name of the Borrower upon any such notes, checks,
acceptances, drafts, money orders or other form of payment or on Collateral or
security of any kind and to effect the deposit and collection thereof, and the
Agent shall have the further right and power to endorse the name of the Borrower
on any documents otherwise relating to such Collateral, and (iii) to do any and
all other things necessary or proper to carry out the intent of this Agreement
and to perfect and protect the liens and rights of the Agent created under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, to claim, bring suit, settle or adjust
any insurance proceeds claims relating to the Collateral.  The Borrower agrees
that neither the Lenders nor any of their officers, directors, shareholders,
employees, counsel, agents, designees or attorneys-in-fact will be liable for
any acts of commission or omission, or for any error of judgment or mistake of
fact or law, except for any acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The
powers granted hereunder are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable
during the term hereof.


ARTICLE VII

AGENCY AND INTERCREDITOR RELATIONSHIPS

Section 7.1  Appointment.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates
and appoints Commerzbank AG, New York Branch, as the Agent of such Lender under
the Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes Commerzbank AG,
New York Branch, to act as the Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  The Agent shall not have any
duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement
and the Loan Documents, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities on the part of the Agent shall be read into any of the Loan
Documents or otherwise exist against the Agent.  The provisions of this Article
VII are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower
shall not have any rights as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise under any of
the provisions of this Article VII.  In performing its functions and duties
under the Loan Documents, the Agent shall act solely as the agent of the Lenders
and does not assume nor shall the Agent be deemed to have assumed any obligation
or relationship of trust or agency with or for the Borrower or any of such
party's respective successors and assigns.

Section 7.2  Delegation of Duties.  The Agent may execute any of its
duties under the Loan Documents by or through

<PAGE>

agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
(including its internal counsel) concerning all matters pertaining to such
duties.  The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of
any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

Section 7.3  Exculpatory Provisions.  The Agent shall not be (a)
liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or any Person
described in Section 7.2 under or in connection with any Loan Document (except
for those actions arising from the Agent's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct), or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower
contained in any Loan Document, or by the Borrower in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received under or
in connection with any Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of any Loan Document or any such
certificate, report, statement or other document, or for any failure of the
Borrower, or any Lender to perform or observe its respective obligations
hereunder or thereunder.  Unless the Agent shall have been requested to do so by
a Lender on such Lender's behalf, the Agent shall not be under any obligation to
any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any
of the agreements contained in, or conditions of any Loan Document, or to
inspect the properties, or the books or records of the Borrower.  This Section
7.3 is intended to govern solely the relationship between the Agent, on the one
hand, and the Lenders, on the other.

Section 7.4  Reliance by the Agent.  The Agent shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy,
telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation
(including by telephone) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and
statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, its internal counsel
and counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected
by the Agent.  The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Lenders required pursuant to this Agreement or it shall first
be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action.

Section 7.5  Notice of Default.  (a)  The Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
unless (i) the Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement,

<PAGE>

describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default," or (ii) the Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, has actual
knowledge of such Default or Event of Default.  In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the
Lenders.  The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event
of Default as shall be directed by the Required Lenders; provided that unless
and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but
shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such Default or Event of Default as the Agent shall deem
advisable and in the best interests of the Lenders.

(b) Each Lender agrees that it shall promptly notify the Agent in
writing after it first has knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or of
any matter which in such Lender's judgment adversely affects any Lender's
respective interests in the Commitment, which notice will describe the Default
or Event of Default or matter in reasonable detail.  The Agent shall give a copy
of any such notice received by the Agent to the other Lenders if such notice
pertains to a Decision by the Lenders pursuant to Section 7.14 or 7.15 hereof.

Section 7.6 Non-Reliance on the Agent and the Other Lenders. Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent, nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereafter
taken, including, without limitation, any review of the affairs of the Borrower
shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent. Each
Lender represents and warrants to the Agent that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, (a) made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, prospects, financial and
other condition, creditworthiness and solvency of the Borrower, (b) satisfied
itself as to the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency and value of all of the Loan Documents and all other instruments and
documents furnished pursuant to any Loan Document, and (c) made its own decision
as to its Percentage of the Commitment pursuant to this Agreement. Each Lender
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent
or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analyses,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement,
and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, operations, property, prospects, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required pursuant to the Loan Documents to be furnished by
the Agent to the

<PAGE>

Lenders, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations,
property, prospects, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the
Borrower which may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

Section 7.7  Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Agent (in its capacity as such) and its officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and
without limiting the obligation, if any, of the Borrower to do so), ratably in
accordance with their Percentages, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without
limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agent or such Person
in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding
commenced or threatened, whether or not the Agent or such Person shall be
designated a party thereto) that may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent or such Person as a result of, or arising out of, or
in any way related to or by reason of, any of the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents or the execution, delivery or performance of any Loan
Document (but excluding any such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or such
Person as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction).  The agreements in
this subsection shall survive the payment of the Promissory Notes and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

Section 7.8  The Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Borrower as though it were not the Agent hereunder.
With respect to Advances made or renewed by it and any Promissory Note issued to
it, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent.

Section 7.9  Agent's Resignation.  The Agent may resign at any time by
giving notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall designate within 45 days in writing
another Person as the successor Agent. Provided that no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, Borrower shall have the right to approve such
successor Agent.  If such proposed successor Agent agrees in writing to act as
the Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges,
duties and obligations of the resigning Agent, and the resigning Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations as Agent under this

<PAGE>

Agreement.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of
this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was the Agent under this Agreement.

Section 7.10  Appointment of a Substitute Agent.  (a)  Commerzbank AG,
New York Branch, shall be the initial Agent under this Agreement and the Loan
Documents until the Loan Documents have been terminated and the Lenders have
been paid in full.  In the event that any Agent determines, for good cause
(including, without limitation, a conflict which, in such Agent's judgment, is
material), that it is not in the best interest of the Agent to continue to act
as the Agent, then the Agent may, at its option and upon thirty (30) days' prior
written notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, request a substitute Agent be
selected in accordance with the terms of this Section to act as the Agent with
respect to such matters.  Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice,
the Required Lenders shall select a proposed substitute agent and shall notify
the Borrower of the identity of such proposed substitute agent.  In addition,
the Required Lenders, on not less than thirty (30) days' notice to the Agent,
may elect to appoint a substitute Agent in the event that the Agent has acted
hereunder with willful misconduct, gross negligence or exhibited a continuing
pattern of negligence with respect to its duties and obligations hereunder.
Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
Borrower shall have the right to approve any such proposed substitute agent.
The succeeding substitute Agent shall have all the rights, powers and duties of
the Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such substitute Agent, effective upon
its appointment.  In the event that the substitute Agent wishes to resign, it
may do so upon thirty (30) days' prior notice to the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders, and a new substitute Agent shall be appointed in accordance with this
Section.  After any retiring substitute Agent's resignation hereunder as
substitute Agent, the provisions of this Section 7.10 and Section 8.4 hereof
shall inure to the benefit of such retired substitute Agent as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was substitute Agent under this
Agreement.

Section 7.11  Loans.  Each Lender shall make available to the Borrower
such Lender's portion of the Commitment subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of the Loan Documents.  The Borrower shall look solely to each Lender
for the performance of such Lender's obligations, covenants and agreements under
the Loan Documents on the part of each Lender to be performed or observed with
respect to each such portion of the Commitment, subject to and upon the
conditions, limitations and restrictions set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, as evidenced by the signature of each such party hereto.  In the
event any Lender has not made available its Percentage of any Advance, the Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to), and each Lender authorizes the Agent to,
advance for such Lender's account, pursuant to the

<PAGE>

terms hereof, the amount of the Advance to be made by such Lender and each
Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent in immediately available funds for any
amount so advanced on its behalf.  If any such reimbursement is not made in
immediately available funds on the same day on which the Agent shall have made
such amount available on behalf of any Lender, such Lender shall also pay
interest thereon to the Agent at the Federal Funds Rate.

Section 7.12  Priority of Loans.  Each Lender's portion of the
Commitment shall be of equal priority with each other Lender's portion of the
Commitment, and no portion of the Commitment shall have priority or preference
over any other portion of the Commitment or the security therefor, except as
provided in Sections 7.20 through 7.24 hereof.

Section 7.13  Books and Records.  The Agent will keep customary books
and records relating to the Advances, and such books and records shall be
available at the Agent's office for the Lenders' reasonable inspection during
the Agent's normal business hours.  The original Loan Documents shall be kept at
the New York office of the Agent or at such other office of the Agent or at such
other place as may be designated from time to time by the Agent and shall be
made available to any Lender for inspection at such office within a reasonable
period of time following such Lender's written request to inspect same.

Section 7.14  Decisions of the Lenders. (a)  Except as expressly set
forth in Sections 7.15 and 7.16 hereof, all decisions, consents, waivers,
approvals and other actions (collectively, "Decisions") authorized to be taken
under or in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by any
Lender shall be taken by the Agent in its discretion reasonably exercised,
subject to the provisions of Section 7.4 hereof.  Except as expressly provided
in Sections 7.15 and 7.16 hereof, the Agent (i) may consent or withhold consent
to any action by the Borrower, (ii) may exercise or refrain from exercising any
power, rights or remedies hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or
otherwise in respect of the Advances, and/or (iii) may waive any conditions in
any Loan Documents, so long as such consent, exercise or waiver would not, in
the Agent's judgment reasonably exercised, represent a departure from the
standards followed by the Agent in the administration of loans held by the Agent
entirely for its own account.  The Agent may request a Decision with respect to
matters described in Sections 7.15 and 7.16 hereof at any time by making a
request for such Decision in writing to all of the Lenders.  Any such request
(x) shall contain an adequate description together with relevant background
information of the Decision being requested, (y) shall specify the reasons for
such request, and (z) shall state the effect of not responding to such notice as
set forth in this Section.  The Agent will provide the Lenders with such
additional information as the Lenders may reasonably request to assist such
Lenders in reaching a Decision, to the extent such information is

<PAGE>

in the Agent's possession or under its control.  The requested Decision shall be
deemed approved by the Lenders if and when the Agent receives written approval
from the required percentage of the Lenders as specified in Sections 7.15 and
7.16 hereof, as the case may be.  If a Lender does not deliver to the Agent a
written objection thereto within ten (10) Business Days after hand delivery,
mailing or delivery to an express courier service of the request by the Agent,
the Agent shall make a second written request for a Decision from that Lender.
If the Lender does not deliver to the Agent a written objection within five (5)
Business Days after hand delivery, mailing or delivery to an express courier
service of such a second request, such Lender shall be deemed to have approved
the requested Decision.  If the Agent is unable to contact the usual
representatives of a Lender for any reason, the Agent will make a good faith
effort to contact other representatives of such Lender as necessary to reach a
Decision within the allotted time.  To the extent that the Agent reasonably
deems necessary, any such Decision may also be requested telephonically by the
Agent from each Lender with such telephonic request to be confirmed in writing
by the Agent.  Any Decision as to which the Agent has made telephonic requests
for approval shall be deemed approved by the Lenders after the Agent has
received the written approval of the required percentage of the Lenders as
specified in Sections 7.15 and 7.16 hereof.  The Borrower shall be promptly
notified of the Decision, if such Decision was made in response to a request by
the Borrower.

Section 7.15  Unanimous Approvals by the Lenders.  No written
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver which adds, deletes, changes or
waives any provisions of the Loan Documents shall (i) extend either the Maturity
Date or any installment or required prepayment of any Advances; (ii) reduce the
rate or extend the time of payment of interest on any Advances; (iii) reduce the
principal amount of any Advances; (iv) reduce the fees payable under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or any other fee payable to the Lenders;
(v) change any Lender's portion of the Commitment or the amount of any Advance
of any Lender (except to the extent permitted by Sections 7.18 and 7.19 hereof);
(vii) change any provision of this Section 7.15 or the definition of Required
Lenders; (viii) modify any financial covenants, waive any Default or Event of
Default, or waive or release any lien on any of the Mortgaged Properties or
commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding, in each case
without the written consent of all the Lenders; or (ix) amend, modify or waive
any provision of any Loan Document, if the effect thereof is to affect the
rights or duties of the Agent, without the written consent of the then the
Agent.  Any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver shall apply to
each of the Lenders equally and shall be binding upon the Borrower, the Lenders,
Agent and all future holders of the Promissory Notes.  In the case of any
waiver, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent shall be restored to their
former position and rights hereunder and under the outstanding Promissory Notes,
and any

<PAGE>

Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 7.16 Approvals by the Required Lenders. (a) Upon the Agent's
receipt of a notice of default (as defined in Section 7.5(a) hereof) with
respect to an Event of Default, the Agent shall consult with the Lenders in
respect of any such Event of Default to determine a course of action which is
acceptable to the Required Lenders. Subject to Section 7.15 hereof, the Agent
shall pursue any such course of action approved by the Required Lenders in
respect of any such Event of Default, including, without limitation,
acceleration of the Advances. In the event that the Required Lenders cannot
decide which remedies, if any, are to be pursued, the Agent may commence
proceedings on behalf of the Lenders; provided, however, that if at any time
thereafter the Required Lenders shall direct that a different or additional
remedial action shall be taken, such different or additional remedial action
shall be taken in lieu of or in addition to such proceedings.

(b) The Agent shall not, without the prior approval of the Required
Lenders, (i) enter into written amendments, supplements, modifications or
waivers for the purpose of adding, deleting, changing or waiving any of the
provisions of Article V or Section 6.1, except to the extent such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver requires the unanimous consent of the Lenders
pursuant to Section 7.15 hereof, or (ii) enter into written amendments,
supplements, modifications or waivers for the purpose of adding, deleting,
changing or waiving any provision of the Loan Documents, except to the extent
such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver requires the unanimous
consent of the Lenders (pursuant to Section 7.15 hereof), or (iii) consent to,
approve, or waive the requirement of receipt of, any documents, certificates or
other agreements or statements delivered or to be delivered by the Borrower or
any other Person pursuant to Article III hereof, or (iv) consent to or permit
(if not expressly permitted under the Loan Documents) the assignment or transfer
by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under any Loan Document, or
consent to any merger or consolidation or sale, lease or other disposal of all
or a substantial part of the Borrower's property or assets.

(c) All losses, costs, expenses, disbursements, liabilities, fees
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements), obligations, damages,
suits, actions and penalties of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, a
"Loss") incurred by the Agent in connection with the Advances or the enforcement
thereof shall be borne by the Lenders in accordance with each Lender's
Percentage.

<PAGE>

(d) Each Lender shall, upon demand by the Agent, reimburse the Agent
(to the extent not otherwise reimbursed by the Borrower) for such Lender's
Percentage of (i) any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent in good faith
in connection with any Event of Default under the Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of outside counsel), and
(ii) any other expenses incurred in good faith to the extent not reimbursed by
the Borrower in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents.

(e) The Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the provisions of
Sections 7.14 through 7.16 and any modifications thereof entered into by the
Agent and the Lenders of such provisions and specifically acknowledges and
agrees that, notwithstanding any provisions in the Loan Documents requiring
action by the "Lenders" or similar provisions in connection with the declaration
of an Event of Default, the acceleration of the indebtedness evidenced by the
Loan Documents and/or the exercise of any remedies under the Loan Documents, the
Agent is hereby empowered to act on behalf of the Lenders in accordance with the
provisions hereof and the authority of the Agent with respect to any action
taken by the Agent pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement shall not
be contested by the Borrower by reason of any different or conflicting provision
contained in any of the Loan Documents.

Section 7.17  Participation.  Any Lender may at any time after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, sell to one or more Persons (each a
"Participant") participating interests in any Advance owing to such Lender, any
Promissory Note held by such Lender and/or any other interest of such Lender
hereunder (in respect of any such Lender, its "Credit Exposure").
Notwithstanding any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a
Participant, unless the Agent shall have agreed otherwise, such Lender's rights
and obligations hereunder shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain
solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the
holder of any such Promissory Note for all purposes hereunder (except as
expressly provided below), and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations hereunder.  The Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.13 and 2.15 hereof.  Each Lender
agrees that any agreement between such Lender and any such Participant in
respect of such participating interest shall not restrict such Lender's right to
agree to any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to any Loan Document,
except where the result of any of the foregoing would be to extend the final
maturity of any Advance or any regularly scheduled installment thereof or reduce
the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon or reduce the
principal amount thereof.

<PAGE>

Section 7.18  Assignments.  (a)  Any Lender may, in the ordinary
course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and from time to time assign to any
Lender or any affiliate thereof or to any other Person (each a "Purchasing
Lender") all or any part of its Credit Exposure in amounts not less than
$10,000,000.  The Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders agree that to the extent
of any assignment, the Purchasing Lender shall be deemed to have the same rights
and benefits under the Loan Documents and the same obligation to share pursuant
to Section 7.24 hereof as it would have had if it had been a Lender which was
one of the original parties hereto.  The consent of the Agent and, provided no
Default or Event of Default has occurred, the Borrower shall be required prior
to an assignment becoming effective, which consents will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided that the Agent shall be entitled to
continue to deal solely and directly with the assignor Lender in connection with
the interests so assigned to the Purchasing Lender unless and until such
Purchasing Lender executes a supplement to this Agreement, substantially in the
form of Exhibit M hereto (a "Form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement").

(b) Upon (i) execution of a Form of Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, (ii) delivery of an executed copy thereof to the Borrower and the
Agent, (iii) payment by such Purchasing Lender to such transferor Lender of an
amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Lender and
such Purchasing Lender, and (iv) payment to Agent of an assignment fee of $2500
for each assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its Credit Exposure,
such transferor Lender shall be released from its obligations hereunder to the
extent of such assignment and such Purchasing Lender shall for all purposes be a
Lender party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of
a Lender under this Agreement to the same extent as if it were an original party
hereto, and no further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the
Agent shall be required.  Such Form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall
be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent,
necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender as a Lender.
Promptly after the consummation of any transfer to a Purchasing Lender pursuant
hereto, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate
arrangements so that a replacement Promissory Note is issued to such transferor
Lender and a new Promissory Note is issued to such Purchasing Lender, in each
case in principal amounts reflecting such transfer.  The Purchasing Lender shall
furnish to Borrower, at least 10 days prior to the date on which the first
payment to such Purchasing Lender is due, the documents described in Section
2.17(b) hereof.

(c) Commerzbank AG, Los Angeles Branch, agrees that it will not assign
to a Purchasing Lender any part of its

<PAGE>

Credit Exposure such that, after giving effect to such assignment, Commerzbank
AG, Los Angeles Branch's Percentage shall be less than 20%, unless the foregoing
shall (or in Commerzbank AG, Los Angeles Branch's reasonable judgment is likely
to) constitute a violation of any Requirement of Law.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall restrict or limit Commerzbank AG, Los Angeles
Branch, from selling a participating interest in any portion, or all, of its
Credit Exposure.

Section 7.19  Withholding.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, no Participant or other assignee of all or any part of the Credit
Exposure of any Lender (each, a "Non-Party Holder"), other than a Purchasing
Lender, shall be entitled to any of the benefits of Section 2.16 hereof.

Section 7.20  Amounts Received by the Lenders.  Each Lender agrees
that it shall act as a trustee for the benefit of the other Lenders to the
extent of the respective interests of the other Lenders in the Advances with
respect to all sums of any kind paid to or received by such Lender in payment of
all or a portion of the Advances by or on behalf of the Borrower.

Section 7.21  No Joint Venture.  Neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the selling of an interest in the Advances nor any agreement to
share in profits or losses as provided herein is intended to be, nor shall it be
construed to be, the formation of a partnership or joint venture among the
parties to this Agreement.

Section 7.22  Acknowledgment by Parties Hereto.  The agreement to and
acceptance of this Agreement by the parties hereto, indicated by the execution
of this Agreement, shall evidence (a) each party's acceptance of all the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (b) each
party's consent to the Agent's acting as the Agent on behalf of the Lenders with
regard to all aspects of the administration, enforcement and collection of the
Advances and to all matters pertaining to the Loan Documents as provided for
herein.

Section 7.23  Right of the Lenders and the Agent to Transact Business.
The Lenders, the Agent and/or any of their respective affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally
engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower or any other Person without
any duty to account therefor to the other Lenders and/or the Agent, as the case
may be.

Section 7.24  Sharing of Payments.  Each of the Lenders agrees that if
it should receive any amount under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the
exercise of the right of banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action,

<PAGE>

by the enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents, or otherwise) which is
applicable to the payment of any Advance of a sum which with respect to the
related sum or sums received by the other Lenders is in a greater proportion
than the total of such Advance then owed and due to such Lender bears to the
total of such Advance then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior
to such receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase
for cash without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in such
Advance owing to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional
participation by all of the Lenders in such amount; provided that if all or any
portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such
purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of
such recovery, but without interest.

Section 7.25  Limitation of Liability.  No claim may be made by the
Borrower or any other Person against the Agent or any Lender or any of their
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agent of any of such
Persons for any special, indirect or consequential damages in respect of any
claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or
under this Article VII; and the Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not
to sue upon any such claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and
whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

address or telecopier number as such party may hereafter specify by notice to

<PAGE>

such delivery service, or (v) if given by any other means when delivered at the

Section 8.2  Amendments, Etc.  No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, nor consent to any departure by
either party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
in writing and signed by the party or its agent, if authorized to act on its
behalf, against whom enforcement of such waiver or amendment is sought, and then
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specified purpose for which given.  None of the foregoing shall negate or

Section 8.3  No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.  No failure or delay on
the part of the Lenders in exercising any right or remedy hereunder or under any
other Loan Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower and the Agent
or the Lenders shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan
Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or remedy hereunder.  The rights and remedies herein and in the
other Loan Documents expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that the Lenders would otherwise have.  No notice to or
demand on the Borrower not required hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Lenders to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or
demand.

the preparation, execution, and delivery of, preservation of rights under,
enforcement of, and, after an Event of Default, refinancing, renegotiation, or

(c) indemnify the Agent and the Lenders and each of their officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, representatives, and agents from, and hold
each of them harmless against, any and all costs, losses, liabilities, claims,

designated a party thereto) arising out of or by reason of any litigation, or
other proceeding related to any actual or proposed use by the Borrower of the
proceeds of any of the Advances or the Borrower entering into and performing of
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or resulting from the ownership of
any Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation,
litigation, or other proceeding; provided that the Borrower shall not be
obligated to indemnify any such Person to the extent of any costs, losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, or expenses caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Person.

If and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrower under this
Section 8.4 are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make
the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations

this Section 8.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the payment
of the sums due hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

Section 8.5  Right of Setoff.  In addition to and not in limitation of
all rights of offset that the Lenders may have under applicable law, the Lenders
shall, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default

obligations are matured, have the right to appropriate and apply to the payment
of the Borrower's obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) of the
Borrower then or thereafter held by, and other indebtedness or property then or
thereafter owing by, the Lenders.

Section 8.6  Benefit of Agreement.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors

transfer any of its interest hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Lenders.

Section 8.7  Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.  (a)  This
Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be

constituting a portion of a Mortgaged Property (a "Release Parcel") but only if
and on the condition that:

(i) each Release Request shall be in writing, shall contain all
information necessary for the Agent to cause a Release in recordable form
to be prepared and shall be given at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the requested date of such Release;

(ii) each Release Request shall constitute Borrower's

demonstrating to the Agent's satisfaction that (a) no portion of the
extended stay facility constructed (or to be constructed) on the Mortgaged
Property from which the Release Parcel is to be Released is (or will be)
located on such Release Parcel, (b) the requested Release shall not cause
or result in the remaining Mortgaged Property and the existence and use of
the extended stay facility constructed (or to be constructed) thereon to
fail to comply with any Use Requirements or Requirements of Law, and (c) no
portion of the Total Costs allocated in a manner satisfactory to Agent to
the Release Parcel is included in the computation of the Maximum
Availability Amount;

(iii)  as of the date of such Release Request, and as of the
effective date of such Release (before as well as after giving effect to
such Release), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, and each Release Request shall constitute Borrower's
representation and warranty that the foregoing is true, complete and
accurate;

(iv) before as well as after giving effect to such Release,
subject to the provisions of Section 5.5 hereof, all representations and
warranties contained herein (except representations and warranties
expressly provided herein as being made only as of the Closing Date) shall
be true and correct in all material respects with the same effect as though
such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the date of
such Release;

(v) Borrower executes, acknowledges and delivers to Agent, at
Borrower's expense, any and all documents and instruments reasonably
required by Agent to preserve and maintain Agent's and Lenders' rights,
upon and following any such Release, under and with respect to the Loan
Documents; and

(vi) (1) The Agent shall have received payment of all costs and
expenses (other than the legal fees described

<PAGE>

in the following clause (2) of this subparagraph) incurred by Agent in
connection with such Release, including, but not limited to, all title
insurance premiums arising as a result of endorsements required by Agent in
connection with such Release, and (2) receipt of a Release Request for each
Release shall constitute Borrower's agreement and covenant to pay to the
Agent, promptly upon demand (together with a reasonably detailed invoice(s)
in respect thereof), all reasonable legal fees and expenses arising in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and review of each
Release, the documents and instruments described in this Section, and all
other documents relating to, and rendering at the request of Agent all
advice respecting, each Release.

In the event that all of the foregoing conditions to a Release have been
satisfied, then, at Borrower's request, the Agent shall furnish such Release for
recordation to the title company insuring the Agent's interest in the Mortgaged
Property affected by such Release or as otherwise designated by Borrower.

Section 8.12  Subordination of Certain Mortgaged Property.  Agent
agrees that, upon Borrower's request (a "Subordination Request"), it will
deliver to Borrower a form of subordination, duly executed and acknowledged by
the Agent, subordinating the lien of the applicable Mortgage (a
"Subordination"), to any Development Encumbrances on a Mortgaged Property, but
only if and on the condition that:

(i) each Subordination Request shall be in writing, shall contain
all information necessary for the Agent to cause a Subordination in
recordable form to be prepared and shall be given at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the requested date of such Subordination;

(ii) Agent shall have received an endorsement to the title policy
referred to in Section 3.3(a)(iii) with respect to the applicable Mortgaged
Property indicating that since the date of the last endorsement to such
policy there has been no change in the state of title not theretofore
approved by Agent, providing with respect to such Development Encumbrances
a so-called "comprehensive endorsement" (or equivalent), to the extent
available in the jurisdiction in which such Mortgaged Property is located,
and such other affirmative insurance as Agent shall reasonably require,
which endorsement shall have the effect of redating the title policy to the
date of recordation of, and insuring the lien of the Mortgage as
subordinated pursuant to, the Subordination;

(iii)  as of the date of such Subordination Request, and as of
the effective date of such Subordination (before as well as after giving
effect to such Subordination), no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, and each Subordination Request shall constitute
Borrower's representation and warranty that the foregoing is true, complete
and accurate;

<PAGE>

(iv) before as well as after giving effect to such Subordination,
subject to the provisions of Section 5.5 hereof, all representations and
warranties contained herein (except representations and warranties
expressly provided herein as being made only as of the Closing Date) shall
be true and correct in all material respects with the same effect as though
such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the date of
such Subordination;

(v) Borrower executes, acknowledges and delivers to Agent, at
Borrower's expense, any and all documents and instruments reasonably
required by Agent to preserve and maintain Agent's and Lenders' rights,
upon and following any such Subordination, under and with respect to the
Loan Documents; and

(vi) (1) The Agent shall have received payment of all costs and
expenses (other than the legal fees described in the following clause (2)
of this subparagraph) incurred by Agent in connection with such
Subordination, including, but not limited to, all title insurance premiums
arising as a result of endorsements required by Agent in connection with
such Subordination, and (2) receipt of a Subordination Request for each
Subordination shall constitute Borrower's agreement and covenant to pay to
the Agent, promptly upon demand (together with a reasonably detailed
invoice(s) in respect thereof), all reasonable legal fees and expenses
arising in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and review
of each Subordination, the documents and instruments described in this
Section, and all other documents relating to, and rendering at the request
of Agent all advice respecting, each Subordination.

Section 8.13  Confidentiality by the Agent and the Lenders.  The Agent
and the Lenders agree that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, except
as required by law or regulation or by legal process, to keep all Non-public
Information delivered by the Borrower to the Agent or the Lenders confidential
and not to disclose or reveal any Non-public Information to any person, other
than those employed or retained by the Agent or the Lenders (including, without
limitation, employees, counsel, accountants, engineers, advisers, experts and
consultants to the Agent or the Lenders).  Except as provided for in the next
sentence, in the event that the Agent or any Lender is requested pursuant to, or
required by, applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any
Non-public Information, the Agent or such Lender agrees that it shall provide
the Borrower with prompt notice of such request(s) and, unless required by law
or regulation to disclose sooner, shall wait at least forty-eight (48) hours
before disclosing such Non-public information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else to the contrary herein contained or contained in any of the other
Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section 8.13 shall not apply to (a) the
disclosure or sharing of any non-public information among the Agent and the
Lenders, (b) the disclosure by the Agent or any Lender of any non-public
information to

<PAGE>

federal, state and local bank regulators or other governmental agencies to the
extent required or requested to do so (such disclosure shall not, however, in
and of itself be deemed to render such information public), and (c) the Agent or
any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed
assignment or participation, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed
assignee or participant under a requirement of confidentiality, any non-public
information relating to the Borrower, the Collateral, the Borrower's assets,
properties or financial condition or information otherwise furnished to the
Agent or the Lenders by the Borrower.

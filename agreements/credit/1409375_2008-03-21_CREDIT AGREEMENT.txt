CREDIT AGREEMENT



THIS
CREDIT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of March 18, 2008, by and
between ORION ENERGY SYSTEMS, INC., a Wisconsin corporation and GREAT LAKES ENERGY
TECHNOLOGIES, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company (each individually, a
“Borrower”), and WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (“Bank”). Each
reference herein to “Borrower” shall mean each and every party, collectively and
individually, defined above as a Borrower.



RECITALS



A.              Bank,
through its Wells Fargo Business Credit operating division, extended to
Borrower certain credit facilities pursuant to the terms of a Credit and
Security Agreement dated December 22, 2005 (as amended, the “WFBC
Agreement”).




B.              Bank
and Borrower have now agreed that from and after the date of this           Agreement,
the credit facilities extended by Bank shall be extended by its           Commercial
Banking Group operating division, rather than by its Wells Fargo           Business
Credit operating division, and Bank and Borrower have agreed to such           credit on
the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, which shall           terminate and
replace the WFBC Agreement. Any ancillary agreements between Bank           and Borrower
other than this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect           unless
explicitly replaced or terminated by Bank and Borrower in writing.




NOW,
THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, Bank and Borrower hereby agree that this Agreement shall terminate and
replace the WFBC Agreement, and further agree as follows:



ARTICLE I
CREDIT TERMS



SECTION
1.1.    LINE OF CREDIT.




(a)    Line
of Credit; Discretionary Increases to Line of Credit. Subject to the           terms
and conditions of this Agreement, Bank hereby agrees to make advances to
Borrower from time to time up to and including August 31, 2010, not to exceed
at           any time the aggregate principal amount of TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
($25,000,000.00)(“Line of Credit”), the proceeds of which shall be
used for working capital or other general corporate purposes. Borrower’s
obligation to repay advances under the Line of Credit shall be evidenced by a
$25,000,000.00 promissory note dated the same date as this Agreement (“Line
of Credit Note”), the terms of which are incorporated by reference. The
Line of Credit Note shall be given as a replacement for, and not in
satisfaction           of, the Borrower’s $25,000,000 Revolving Note dated December
22, 2005.




Borrower
may request an increase in the Line of Credit by up to an additional TWENTY FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS ($25,000,000.00), provided that after giving effect to the requested increase, the
aggregate amount of the Line of Credit does not exceed $50,000,000.00. Borrower may
request such an increase once in the minimum amount of at least $1,000,000.00. Following
Borrower’s request, Bank may increase the amount of the Line of Credit, provided that
on or before the proposed date of the effectiveness of the increase, Borrower provides
Bank (i) pro-forma projections for the next four fiscal quarters, (ii) a current
compliance certificate executed by an officer of Borrower acceptable to Bank both showing
that Borrower is and will in the future be compliance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, and (iii) a replacement Line of Credit Note for the full amount of the
increased Line of Credit. The amount of the Line of Credit in excess of $25,000,000.00
is a discretionary Line of Credit, and Wells Fargo has no obligation to make an advance
even if no Event of Default has occurred under the terms of this Agreement.













(b)    Limitation
on Borrowings. Outstanding borrowings under the Line of           Credit, whether
before or after any increase to the amount of the Line of           Credit, shall not at
any time exceed a borrowing base consisting of the           aggregate of (i) eighty
percent (80%) of Borrower’s Eligible Accounts, plus           (ii) fifty percent
(50%) of the value of Borrower’s Eligible Inventory or           $10,000,000,
whichever is less, and less (iii) an amount equal to the Borrowing           Base
Reserve.




The
foregoing shall be determined by Bank upon receipt and review of all collateral reports
required hereunder and such other documents and collateral information as Bank may from
time to time require. Borrower acknowledges that said borrowing base was established by
Bank with the understanding that, among other items, the aggregate of all returns,
rebates, discounts, credits and allowances for the immediately preceding three (3) months
at all times shall be less than five percent (5%) of Borrower’s gross sales for said
period. If such dilution of Borrower’s accounts for the immediately preceding three
(3) months at any time exceeds five percent (5%) of Borrower’s gross sales for said
period, or if there at any time exists any other matters, events, conditions or
contingencies which Bank reasonably believes may affect payment of any portion of
Borrower’s accounts, Bank, in its sole reasonable discretion, may reduce the
foregoing advance rate against eligible accounts receivable to a percentage appropriate to
reflect such additional dilution and/or establish additional reserves against
Borrower’s eligible accounts receivable.



“Borrowing
Base Reserve” means, as of any date of determination, an amount or a percent of a
specified category or item that Bank establishes in its sole reasonable discretion from
time to time to reduce availability under the borrowing base (i) to reflect without
limitation events, conditions, contingencies, litigation or other risks which affect the
assets, financial performance, business or prospects of Borrower, or the collateral
securing the indebtedness or its value, or the enforceability, perfection or priority of
Bank’s security interest in the collateral, or (ii) to reflect Bank’s judgment
that any information relating to Borrower, its financial condition or collateral, may be
incomplete, inaccurate or misleading in any material respect, or may have materially
changed in a way that may not otherwise be meaningfully measured by existing financial
covenants.



“Eligible
Accounts” means all unpaid Accounts of the Borrower arising from the sale or lease of
goods or the performance of services, net of any credits, but excluding any such Accounts
having any of the following characteristics:



(i)               That

sixty (60) days past the stated due date or more than one hundred twenty (120)
days past the invoice date;




(ii)               That

warranty claims or returns;














(iii)               That

billings, and that portion of Accounts for which an invoice has not           been sent

been registered with the United States Patent and           Trademark Office;




(v)               Accounts

however, that there shall be included in Eligible Accounts           that portion of
Accounts owed by such units of government for which the Borrower           has provided
evidence satisfactory to the Bank that (A) the Bank has a           first priority

SECTION
7.12.    ARBITRATION.




(a)    Arbitration.
The parties hereto agree, upon demand by any party, to           submit to binding
arbitration all claims, disputes and controversies between or           among them (and
their respective employees, officers, directors, attorneys, and           other agents),
whether in tort, contract or otherwise in any way arising out of           or relating to
(i) any credit subject hereto, or any of the Loan Documents, and           their
negotiation, execution, collateralization, administration, repayment,
modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement,
default or termination; or (ii) requests for additional credit.




(b)    Governing
Rules. Any arbitration proceeding will (i) proceed in a           location in
Wisconsin selected by the American Arbitration Association           (“AAA”);
(ii) be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of           the United States
Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision           in any of the
documents between the parties; and (iii) be conducted by the AAA,           or such other
administrator as the parties shall mutually agree upon, in           accordance with the
AAA’s commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless           the claim or
counterclaim is at least $1,000,000.00 exclusive of claimed           interest,
arbitration fees and costs in which case the arbitration shall be           conducted in
accordance with the AAA’s optional procedures for large,           complex
commercial disputes (the commercial dispute resolution procedures or the
optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes to be referred to
herein as applicable, as the “Rules”). If there is any inconsistency
between the terms hereof and the Rules, the terms and procedures set forth
herein shall control. Any party who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration
following a demand by any other party shall bear all costs and expenses
incurred           by such other party in compelling arbitration of any dispute. Nothing
contained           herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any party that is a bank of
the           protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. §91 or any similar
applicable           state law.




(c)    No
Waiver of Provisional Remedies, Self-Help and Foreclosure. The           arbitration
requirement does not limit the right of any party to (i) foreclose           against real
or personal property collateral; (ii) exercise self-help remedies           relating to
collateral or proceeds of collateral such as setoff or repossession;           or (iii)
obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as replevin, injunctive           relief,
attachment or the appointment of a receiver, before during or after the
pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a
waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any dispute to
arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise
of           the actions detailed in sections (i), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph.




(d)    Arbitrator
Qualifications and Powers. Any arbitration proceeding in which           the amount
in controversy is $5,000,000.00 or less will be decided by a single           arbitrator
selected according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of           greater
than $5,000,000.00. Any dispute in which the amount in controversy           exceeds
$5,000,000.00 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel of three
arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively
participate in all hearings and deliberations. The arbitrator will be a neutral
attorney licensed in the State of Wisconsin or a neutral retired judge of the
state or federal judiciary of Wisconsin, in either case with a minimum of ten
years experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the
dispute to be arbitrated. The arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue
is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in
determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator will decide
(by documents only or with a hearing at the arbitrator’s discretion) any
pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to
state           a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator shall resolve
all           disputes in accordance with the substantive law of Wisconsin and may grant
any           remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the
scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any
award. The arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs
and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator
deems necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure, the Wisconsin Rules of Civil Procedure or other applicable
law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for
judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not
constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to
submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such
action for judicial relief.














(e)    Discovery.
In any arbitration proceeding, discovery will be permitted in           accordance with
the Rules. All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters           directly
relevant to the dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later           than 20
days before the hearing date. Any requests for an extension of the           discovery
periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final           determination by
the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for discovery is           essential for
the party’s presentation and that no alternative means for           obtaining
information is available.




(f)    Class
Proceedings and Consolidations. No party hereto shall be entitled           to join
or consolidate disputes by or against others in any arbitration, except           parties
who have executed any Loan Document, or to include in any arbitration           any
dispute as a representative or member of a class, or to act in any           arbitration
in the interest of the general public or in a private attorney           general
capacity.




(g)    Payment
Of Arbitration Costs And Fees. The arbitrator shall           award all
costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding.




(h)    Miscellaneous.
To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the           arbitrators and the parties
shall take all action required to conclude any           arbitration proceeding within
180 days of the filing of the dispute with the           AAA. No arbitrator or other
party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the           existence, content or
results thereof, except for disclosures of information by           a party required in
the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or           regulation. If more
than one agreement for arbitration by or between the parties           potentially
applies to a dispute, the arbitration provision most directly           related to the
Loan Documents or the subject matter of the dispute shall           control. This
arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or           expiration of any
of the Loan Documents or any relationship between the parties.




















IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the
day and year first written above.

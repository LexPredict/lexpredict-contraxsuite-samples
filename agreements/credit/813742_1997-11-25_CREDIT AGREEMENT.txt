request for the Interest Period specified therein.  If such interest rate is
satisfactory to the Company an Authorized Officer of the Company shall, no later
than 11:00 a.m. Chicago, Illinois time, on such date, so indicate.  Such
indication by an Authorized Officer of the Company shall constitute an
irrevocable request that such Borrowing of Quoted Rate Loans be made at the rate

continuation or conversion with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.9.1 or 2.9.2, as applicable, such Fixed Rate
Loan shall, on such last day, automatically convert to a Reference Rate Loan.
Each conversion or continuation of a Loan in one currency (the "Prior Currency")
into a Loan in another currency (the "Second Currency") shall result in a Loan
in an amount denominated in the Second Currency equal to the equivalent in the
Second Currency of the Loan amount denominated in the Prior Currency, in each
case determined by the Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10.

SECTION 2.9.1.  Eurocurrency Rate Loans, Eurodollar Rate Loans and
Reference Rate Loans.  Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
the Company may elect: (a) to continue all or any portion of any
outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans from the
current Interest Period of such Loans into a subsequent Interest Period to
begin on the last day of such current Interest Period and in the same
currency or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in the same or a
different Eurocurrency, (b) to convert any outstanding Reference Rate
Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans or (c) to
convert one Type of Fixed Rate Loan into any other Type of Loan except a
Quoted Rate Loan, such conversion to occur on the last day of the then
current Interest Period of the Loans being converted.  The Company shall
give the Bank prior telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing) from
an Authorized Officer (x) at least two (2) Banking Days' prior to the date
of continuation or conversion in the case of continuation of or conversion
into a Eurodollar Rate Loan bearing interest with reference to the

of continuation or conversion in the case of continuation of or conversion
into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan [whether bearing interest with reference to
the Interbank Rate (Reserve Adjusted) or the LIBOR Rate (Reserve

to the LIBOR Rate.  Each such notice shall specify whether such Loan bears
interest with reference to the Interbank Rate or the LIBOR Rate, the date,
the amount and the Interest Period, if applicable, and, in the case of a
continuation of or conversion into Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the currency
of the such Loans.

SECTION 2.9.2.  Quoted Rate Loans.  Subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement, the Company may elect (a) to continue all or any
portion of any outstanding Quoted Rate Loans from the current Interest
Period of such Loans into a subsequent Interest Period to begin on the
last day of such current Interest Period and in the same currency, (b) to
convert all or any portion of any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans or
Eurocurrency Rate Loans to Quoted Rate Loans, such conversion to occur on
the last day of the then current Interest Period of the Loans being
converted, or (c) to convert all or any portion of any outstanding
Reference Rate Loans into Quoted Rate Loans.  If the Company desires to
continue or convert outstanding Loans as or into Quoted Rate Loans, the
Company shall give the Bank prior telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in
writing) from an Authorized Officer of the Company of a requested
continuation or conversion under this Section 2.9.2, specifying the date,
amount and Type of Loans to be continued or converted, the applicable
Interest Periods and requesting that the Bank provide the Company by
telephone a quotation of the interest rate(s) that would be applicable to
the requested Quoted Rate Loans for Interest Period(s) of a duration
designated by such Authorized Officer and commencing (a) on the last day
of the current Interest Period in the case of outstanding Fixed Rate Loans
or (b) on the date such rate quotation is requested in the case of
outstanding Reference Rate Loans. Each such notice and request from the
Company, to be effective, must be received by the Bank no later than 11:00
a.m., Chicago, Illinois time on the Banking Day such conversion into or
continuation of Quoted Rate Loans is to occur. If such interest rate is
satisfactory to the Company an Authorized Officer shall, no later than
11:00

<PAGE>

a.m. Chicago, Illinois time, on such date, so indicate. Such indication by
an Authorized Officer of the Company shall constitute an irrevocable
request that the requested continuation of or conversion into Quoted Rate
Loans be consummated at the rate the Bank quoted or would have quoted to
the Company at the time of such indication of acceptance, it being
understood that the Bank does not guarantee that the interest rate quoted
with respect to a particular requested conversion of or continuation into
Quoted Rate Loans shall continue to be available if such rate is not
accepted by an Authorized Officer of the Company at the time of quotation.

SECTION 2.10.  Currency Equivalents.

(a)  Exchange Rate.  Whenever pursuant hereto the Dollar Equivalent
of an amount denominated in any currency other than Dollars is to be
determined as of a date, such determination shall be made at the spot rate
at which the Bank offers to purchase such currency with Dollars at
approximately 10:00 am., Chicago, Illinois time on such date. Whenever the
equivalent in any currency (other than Dollars) is to be determined as of
a date, such determination shall be made in accordance with the preceding
sentence, substituting such currency in which such equivalent is being
determined for Dollars.

(b)  Determination Date.  For purposes of determining the Commitment
Fee referred to in Section 3.3.1, the outstanding balance of the Revolving
Loans and the Revolving Credit Commitment from time to time, the Dollar
Equivalent of each Loan then denominated in a currency other than Dollars
shall be determined as of each of the dates (a "Determination Date") as
follows:

(i)   the date ten (10) Banking Days prior to  the last day of
each calendar quarter of each calendar year; and

(ii)  the date five (5) Banking Days prior to each of the
following dates (unless such of the following dates is also the last
day of any calendar quarter of any calendar year;

(A)   the date a Loan is made;

(B)   the date a Eurodollar Rate Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan
is continued from the current Interest Period of such Loan
into a subsequent Interest Period;

(C)   the date an outstanding Loan is converted from one Type of
Loan into another Type of Loan; or

(D)   the date the principal of a Loan, or portion thereof, is
paid or prepaid.

The Dollar Equivalent of any Loan, or portion thereof, determined as of
any Determination Date, shall be deemed to remain unchanged from such
determination until the next succeeding Determination Date.

SECTION 2.11.  Funding.  As to any Eurodollar Rate Loan or Eurocurrency
Rate Loan the Bank may, if it so elects, fulfill its obligation to make,
continue or convert such Fixed Rate Loans hereunder by causing one of its
foreign branches or Related Parties (or an international banking facility
created by the Bank) to make or maintain such Fixed Rate Loan; provided,
however, that such Fixed Rate Loan shall nonetheless be deemed to have been made
and to be held by the Bank, and the obligation of the Company to repay such
Fixed Rate Loan shall nevertheless be to the Bank account of such
foreign branch, Related Party or

<PAGE>

international banking facility. In addition, the Company hereby consents and
agrees that, for purposes of any determination to be made hereunder, it shall be
conclusively assumed that the Bank elected to fund all Eurodollar Rate Loans and
all Eurocurrency Rate Loans by purchasing Eurodollar deposits, or deposits in
the applicable Eurocurrency, in its Interbank Lending Office's or LIBOR Lending
Office's interbank eurocurrency market.

SECTION 2.12.  Notes.  The Revolving Loans made by the Bank to the Company
under this Agreement shall be evidenced by the Revolving Note made by the
Company payable to the order of the Bank in the maximum amount of the Bank's
Revolving Credit Commitment.  The Term Loan made by the Bank to the Company
under this Agreement shall be evidenced by the Term Note made by the Company
payable to the order of the Bank in the maximum amount of the Bank's Term
Commitment or if less, the actual amount of the Term Loan made to the Company.
The Company hereby irrevocably authorizes the Bank to make (or cause to be made)
appropriate notations on the grid attached to each Note (or on any continuation
of such grid), which notations, if made, shall evidence, inter alia, the date
of, the outstanding principal of, and the interest rate and Interest Period
applicable to the Loans evidenced thereby.  Such notations shall be conclusive
and binding on the Company absent manifest error; provided, however, that the
failure of the Bank to make any such notations shall not limit or otherwise
affect any Obligations of the Company.

reduced; and

<PAGE>

(c)  shall, immediately upon any acceleration of the Loans pursuant
to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, repay all Loans; and

ARTICLE IV

CERTAIN INTEREST RATE AND OTHER PROVISIONS


SECTION 4.1.  Fixed Rate Lending Unlawful.  If the Bank  shall determine
that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law
makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts
that it is unlawful, for the Bank to make, continue or maintain any Loan as, or
to convert any Loan into, a Fixed Rate Loan of a certain Type, the obligations
of the Bank to make, continue, maintain or convert any such Loans shall, upon
such determination, forthwith be suspended until the Bank shall notify the
Company that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and all
Fixed Rate Loans of such Type shall automatically convert into Reference Rate
Loans or, subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 2.9,
another Type of Fixed Rate Loans, at the end of the then current Interest
Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if required by such law or assertion.

SECTION 4.2.  Deposits Unavailable.  If the Bank has determined that

(a)  Dollar or Eurocurrency deposits, as the case may be, in the
relevant amount and for the relevant Interest Period are not available to
the Bank in its relevant market; or

(b)  by reason of circumstances affecting the Bank's relevant market,
adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable
hereunder to Fixed Rate Loans of a particular Type,

then, upon notice from the Bank to the Company, the obligations of the Bank to
make or continue any Loans as, or to convert any Loans into, Fixed Rate Loans of
such Type shall forthwith be suspended until the Bank shall have notified the
Company that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

SECTION 4.3.  Increased Capital Costs With Respect to Commitments. If any
change in, or the introduction, adoption, effectiveness, interpretation,
reinterpretation or phase-in of, any law or regulation, directive, guideline,
decision or request (whether or not having the force of law) of any court,
central bank, regulator or other governmental authority affects or would affect
the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by the Bank or any
Person controlling the Bank, and the Bank determines (in its sole and absolute
discretion) that the rate of return on its or such controlling Person's capital
as a consequence of its Commitment or the Loans made by the Bank is reduced to a
level below that which the Bank or such controlling Person could have achieved
but for the occurrence of any such circumstance, then, in any such case upon
notice from time to time by the Bank to the Company the Company agrees that it
shall immediately pay to the Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate
the Bank or such controlling Person for such reduction in rate of return at the
time suffered or incurred.  A statement of the Bank as to any such additional
amount or amounts (including calculations thereof in reasonable detail) shall,
in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Company.  In
determining such amount, the Bank may use any reasonable method of averaging and
attribution that it (in its sole and absolute discretion) shall deem applicable.

SECTION 4.4.  Funding Losses.  In the event the Bank shall incur any loss
or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation
or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by the Bank to make,
continue or maintain any portion of the principal amount of any Loan as, or to
convert any portion of the principal amount of any Loan into, a Fixed Rate Loan)
as a result of

(a)  any conversion or repayment or prepayment of the principal
amount of any Fixed Rate Loans on a date other than the scheduled last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto;

(b)  any Loans not being made as Fixed Rate Loans in accordance with
the Borrowing Request therefor; or

<PAGE>

(c)  any Loans not being continued as, or converted into, Fixed Rate
Loans in accordance with the Continuation/ Conversion Notice therefor,

then, upon the written notice of the Bank to the Company, the Company agrees
that it shall, within five (5) Banking Days of the Company's receipt thereof,
pay to the Bank such amount as will (in the reasonable determination of the
Bank) reimburse the Bank for such loss or expense.  Such written notice (which
shall include calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Company.

SECTION 4.5.  Taxes.  All payments by the Company of principal of, and
interest on, the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future income,
excise, stamp or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or
other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but
excluding franchise taxes and taxes imposed on or measured by the Bank's net
income or receipts (such non-excluded items being called "Taxes").  In the event
that any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Company
hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law,
rule or regulation, then the Company will

(a)  pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount required
to be so withheld or deducted;

(b)  promptly forward to the Bank an official receipt or other
documentation satisfactory to the Bank evidencing such payment to such
authority; and

(c)  pay to the Bank such additional amount or amounts as is
necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Bank will
equal the full amount the Bank would have received had no such withholding
or deduction been required.

Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against the Bank with respect to
any payment received by the Bank hereunder, the Bank may pay such Taxes and the
Company agrees that it will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any
penalties, interest or expenses) as is necessary in order that the net amount
received by the Bank after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on
such additional amount) shall equal the amount the Bank would have received had
not such Taxes been asserted; excluding, however, all such amounts which are so
payable due to the negligence of the Bank.

If the Company fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Bank, the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, the Company agrees to indemnify the Bank for any
incremental Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Bank as
a result of any such failure.

If the Bank receives a refund of any amount paid by the Company pursuant
to this Section in respect of amounts required to be withheld or deducted from
amounts due to the Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and
if as a result of the Bank's receipt of such refund the net amount received by
the Bank exceeds the amount to which the Bank is entitled under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, the Bank shall promptly pay to the Company the
amount of such excess.

SECTION 4.6.  Payments, Computations, etc.  Unless otherwise expressly
provided, all payments by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, the Notes or
any other Loan Document shall be made by the Company to the Bank.  All such
payments required to be made to the Bank shall be made, without setoff,
deduction or counterclaim, not later than 12:30 p.m., Chicago, Illinois time, on
the date due, in same day or immediately available funds, to such account as the
Bank shall specify from time to time by notice to the Company. Funds received
after that time shall be deemed to have been received by the Bank on the next
succeeding Banking Day. The Company hereby authorizes the Bank and the Bank may,
in its sole and absolute discretion, provide for the payment of any amounts
required to be paid in Dollars which are due under this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents, by debiting the Demand Deposit Account for the amount

<PAGE>

then due; provided, however, that the failure of the Company to maintain
sufficient balances in the Demand Deposit Account to provide for such payment
shall not affect the Company's obligation to pay when due all amounts payable by
the Company hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Whenever any payment to
be made shall otherwise be due on a day which is not a Banking Day, such payment
shall (except as otherwise required by clause (c) of the definition of the term
"Interest Period" with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate
Loans) be made on the next succeeding Banking Day and such extension of time
shall be included in computing interest and fees, if any, in connection with
such payment.

SECTION 4.7.  Setoff.  The Bank shall, upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default, have the right to appropriate and apply to the payment of the
Obligations (whether or not then due), any and all balances, credits, deposits,
accounts or moneys of the Company then or thereafter maintained with the Bank.
The Bank agrees promptly to notify the Company after any such setoff and
application; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such setoff and application.  The rights of the Bank
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff under applicable law or otherwise) which the Bank may have.

SECTION 4.8.  Use of Proceeds.  The Company will use the proceeds of the
Loans for general operating capital.

SECTION 4.9.  Currency Indemnification.  The obligation of the Company to
make payments hereunder in the currencies specified in Article III shall not be
discharged as satisfied by any tender or recovery which is expressed in any
other currencies except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result
in the actual receipt by the Bank of the full amount in the currencies so
specified payable hereunder.  The Company's obligations to make payments in the
currencies so specified shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional
cause of action for the purpose of recovery in such currencies of the amount, if
any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount in such
currencies payable hereunder, and shall not be affected by judgment being
obtained for any sums due hereunder.

Without limiting the generality of the previous paragraph, the Company
agrees to indemnify the Bank against any loss incurred by it as a result of any
judgment or order being given or made for the payment of any Indebtedness
hereunder and such judgment or order being expressed in a currency other than
the currency of the Indebtedness hereunder and as a result of any variation
having occurred in rates of exchange between the date of any such amount
becoming due hereunder and the date of actual payment thereof.  The foregoing
indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent obligation and shall apply
irrespective of any indulgence granted from time to time and shall continue in
full force and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid.

Loan Document by any of the Indemnified Parties, except for any such Indemnified
Liabilities arising for the account of a particular Indemnified Party by reason
of the relevant Indemnified Party's gross negligence or wilful misconduct. If

reason, the Company hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the

Form of Opinion of Counsel


February 11, 1997



Bank of America Illinois
231 South LaSalle Street
Chicago, Illinois   60697

Attention:  Mr. John W. Weubbe
Vice President

Re:    Credit Agreement dated as of February 11, 1997,
between Bank of America Illinois and Mycogen Corporation

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have acted as counsel for Mycogen Corporation, a California corporation
(the "Company") in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company to
Bank of America Illinois (the "Bank") of that certain (a) Credit Agreement dated
as of February 11, 1997 (the "Credit Agreement") between the Company and the
Bank; (b) Revolving Note dated February 11, 1997, made by the Company payable to
the order of the Bank in the principal amount of $10,000,000 (the "Revolving
Note"); (c) Term Note dated February 11, 1997, made by the Company payable to
the order of the Bank in the principal amount of $15,000,000 (the "Term Note")
(the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Note and the Term Note are referred to
herein as the "Loan Documents").  This opinion is given pursuant to Section
5.1.3 of the Credit Agreement.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Loan Documents.

In rendering this opinion, I have examined the Loan Documents.  I have also
examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my
satisfaction, of such records, documents, certificates and other instruments and
made such inquiries of the Company as in my judgment are necessary or
appropriate for the purposes of the opinions contained herein.  I have assumed
the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted
to me as originals and the conformity to original documents of all documents
submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies.  I have further assumed,
with respect to all documents I have reviewed, the due authorization, execution
and delivery thereof by parties other than the Company.  I have relied as to
factual matters upon certificates or statements of such public officials and
such officers and duly appointed agents of the Company as I have deemed relevant
or necessary.

Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

1.   The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of California, and has the
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted.

2.   The Company has the corporate power and authority to enter into the
Loan Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder.

<PAGE>

3.   The Loan Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Company and constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.

4.   The execution and delivery of the Loan Documents by the Company and
the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder do not and will
not, to the best of my knowledge, (i) contravene or conflict with any provision
of any existing law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, (ii)
contravene or conflict with, result in any breach of, or constitute a default
under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit agreement, loan agreement
or other agreement, contract or instrument binding on it, (iii) conflict with or
result in a violation of any order, writ, judgment or decree which the Company
is a party or by which it may be bound, (iv) conflict with or result in a
violation of the Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or (v)
result in the creation or imposition of any lien.

5.   No order, authorization, consent, license or exemption of, or filing
or registration with, any court or governmental department, agency,
instrumentality or regulatory body is or will be required in connection with
either the execution and delivery by the Company of any Loan Documents, or the
performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder that are required to be
performed on or before the effective dates of the Loan Documents with respect to
the transactions evidenced thereby.

6.   To my knowledge, except as described in the Loan Documents, there are
no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against or affecting the
Company or the properties of the Company before any court or governmental
department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or
foreign, which, if determined adversely to the Company, would have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, properties or operations of the
Company.

7.   The Company is not engaged principally, or in one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying "margin stock" within the meaning of the Regulations G and U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank.

8.   The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

9.   The Company is not a "holding company," nor a "subsidiary company" of
a "holding company," nor an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a
"subsidiary company" of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

10.  No taxes or other charges, including without limitation, intangible or
documentary stamp taxes, mortgage or recording taxes, transfer taxes or similar
charges, are payable on account of the execution or delivery of the Loan
Documents or the creation of the indebtedness evidenced or secured by any of the
Loan Documents or the recording or filing of any of the Loan Documents.

Very truly yours,

The Credits

SECTION 2.01.  Commitments.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower from time to
time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will
not result in such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment.  Within the foregoing limits and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and
reborrow Revolving Loans.

SECTION 2.02.  Loans and Borrowings.  (a) Each Loan shall be made as part
of a Borrowing consisting of Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments.  The failure of any Lender
to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are
several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to
make Loans as required.

(b) Subject to Section 2.12, (i) each Borrowing shall be comprised
entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request in
accordance herewith.  Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by
causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such
Loan in lieu of making such Loan itself; provided that any exercise of such
option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
multiple of $100,000 and not less than $500,000.  At the time that each ABR
Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that
is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $100,000; provided that an
ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the
entire unused balance of the total Revolving Credit Commitments or that is
required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by
Section 2.04(e).   Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the
same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of
five (5) Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding.

<PAGE>

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after the Maturity Date.

SECTION 2.03.  Requests for Revolving Borrowings.   To request a Revolving
Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by
telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed
Borrowing, or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
New York City time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed Borrowing;

provided that any such notice of an ABR Revolving Borrowing to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.04(e) may be
given not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed
Borrowing.  Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and
shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative
Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative
Agent and signed by the Borrower.  Each such telephonic and written Borrowing
Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

(ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business
Day;

(iii)  whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
Eurodollar Borrowing;

(iv) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial
Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

(v) the location and number of the Borrower's account to
which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
requirements of Section 2.05.

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then
the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's
duration.  Promptly following receipt of a  Borrowing Request in accordance with
this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.

SECTION 2.04.  Letters of Credit.  (a) General.  Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of
Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time
during the Availability Period.  In the event of any inconsistency between the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form
of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to,
or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of
Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control; provided that
the failure by

<PAGE>

either this Agreement or any such application to address an issue addressed by
the other shall not be deemed to be an inconsistency.

(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions.  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing
Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date
of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance
of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended,
renewed or extended, the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the
date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name
and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be
necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  If
requested by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit
application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request
for a Letter of Credit.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or
extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each
Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC
Exposure shall not exceed $3,000,000, and (ii) within such $3,000,000 sublimit,
the LC Exposure with respect to Letters of Credit issued other than for the
purpose of purchasing merchandise shall not exceed $500,000.

(c) Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior
to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is 30 Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

(d) Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, and on the
Effective Date with respect to each Letter of Credit outstanding under the
Current Revolving Credit Agreement without further action on the part of the
Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and
each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such
Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate
amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and
in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement
made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as
provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment
required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever.

(e) Reimbursement.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement
in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC

<PAGE>

Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that
such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such
LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if
such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business
Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,
if such LC Disbursement is not less than $100,000, the Borrower may, subject to
the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section
2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an
equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to
make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR
Revolving Borrowing.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement,
the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's
Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the
payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section
2.05 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.05 shall apply,

mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so
received by it from the Lenders.  Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing
Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than
the funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a
Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

(f) Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder.
Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of
their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of
or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any
payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Issuing Bank from liability to

<PAGE>

the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the
extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by
the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and
other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality
thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which
appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter
of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make
payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation,
regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and
make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance
with the terms of such Letter of Credit.  The parties hereto expressly agree
that, (i) in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of
the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction),
the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such
determination made by it hereunder, (ii) nothing herein shall excuse the Issuing
Bank (a) to the extent that its acts constitute gross negligence or wilful
misconduct (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), or (b)
from complying with an injunction issued by any such court, and (iii) in
determining gross negligence hereunder, the conduct of Issuing Bank shall be
measured by the normal conduct of large New York City commercial banks that
regularly issue letters of credit.

(g) Disbursement Procedures.  The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or
will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or
delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

(h) Interim Interest.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.11(e) shall apply.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing
Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

(i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank.  The Issuing Bank may be replaced
at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank.  At
the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all
unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 2.10(b).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i)
the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the
Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter

<PAGE>

and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer
to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all
previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of
an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto
and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank
under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to
such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of
Credit.

SECTION 2.05.  Funding of Borrowings.  (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan
to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders.  The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available
to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to
an account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York
City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;

provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to
the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan
included in such Borrowing.

SECTION 2.06.  Interest Elections.  (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be
of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing
to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in
this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to
different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion
shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing.

(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election.  Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and

<PAGE>

shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative
Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the
Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies
and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to
clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
Borrowing);

(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

(iii)  whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing
or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, then, (i) no outstanding Borrowing may
be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid,
each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of
the Interest Period applicable thereto.

SECTION 2.07.  Termination and Reduction of Commitments.  (a) Unless
previously terminated, the Revolving Credit Commitments shall terminate on the
Maturity Date.

(b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of
the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral
multiple of $100,000 and not less than $1,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall
not terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments if, after giving effect
to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in

<PAGE>

accordance with Section 2.09, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would
exceed the total Revolving Credit Commitments.

(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments under paragraph (b) of
this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable.  Any termination or
reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permanent.  Each
reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be made ratably among the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments.

SECTION 2.08.  Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a) The Borrower
hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan
on the Maturity Date.

(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Character and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein absent manifest error; provided that
the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts
or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent, representing all of the Loans made
and to be made by such lender hereunder.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by a promissory note
representing all Loans made by such Lender hereunder in such form payable to the
order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered
note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

SECTION 2.09.  Prepayment of Loans.  (a) The Borrower shall have the right
at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part,
subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

<PAGE>

(b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, or (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of
such Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be prepaid.  Promptly following receipt
of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall
advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.  Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 2.11 and by any payments required pursuant to Section
2.14.

SECTION 2.10.  Fees.  (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the
rate of 1/4 of 1% per annum on the daily unused amount of the Revolving Credit
Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including the Effective
Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Credit Commitment
terminates.  solely for purposes of computing the fee hereunder, the issuance of
a Letter of Credit will not be deemed to reduce the unused amount of the
Revolving Credit Commitment.  Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in
arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and
on the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments terminate, commencing on
the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any commitment
fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Credit Commitments terminate
shall be payable on demand.  All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee,
which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between
the Borrower and the Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
later of the date of termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the
date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's
standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.  Fronting fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;

provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Credit Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which
the Revolving Credit Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.  Any
other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be
payable within 10 days after demand.  All fronting fees shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

<PAGE>

(d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of
commitment fees, to the Lenders.  Fees paid shall not be refundable under any
circumstances.

SECTION 2.11.  Interest.  (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall
bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate Margin.

(b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus the Applicable Rate Margin.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon
termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided that (i) interest
accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand,
(ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a
prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

(e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate
Base Rate, or Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

SECTION 2.12.  Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of
any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO
Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or

(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders
that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such
Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan)
included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

<PAGE>

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective,
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

SECTION 2.13.  Increased Costs.  (a) If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

(ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London
interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar
Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the
Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in
Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital
of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence
of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit
held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a
level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the
policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender
or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing
Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of
this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

<PAGE>

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to
demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation.

SECTION 2.14.  Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of
any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate
each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  In the
case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be
deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount
of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would
have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to
the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such
Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar
deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar
market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that
such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

SECTION 2.15.  Taxes.  (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or
Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make
such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent,
such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any
payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or

<PAGE>

liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing
Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, and a
copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 2.16.  Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder
(whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or
of amounts payable under Section 2.13, 2.14, or 2.15, or otherwise) prior to
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available
funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on
any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have
been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating
interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent
at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be
made directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that
payments pursuant to Sections 2.13, 2.14, or 2.15, and 9.03 shall be made
directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall
distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person
to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment
hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of
such extension.  All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.

(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC
Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest
and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal
and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.

(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in
such Lender's receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount
of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon
than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such
greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered,  such
participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent

<PAGE>

of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph
shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in
fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation.

(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or (e), 2.05(b) or paragraph (d) of this
Section, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

SECTION 2.17.  Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.   If any
Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required
to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and
(ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would
not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to
pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with
any such designation or assignment.

ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties

The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

SECTION 3.01.  Organization; Powers.  Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to own its properties and carry on its business as now conducted and,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to
do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such
qualification is required.

SECTION 3.02.  Authorization; Enforceability.  The Transactions are within
the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate and, if required, stockholder action.  This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid and

subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

SECTION 3.03.  Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts.  The Transactions (a)
do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any
other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained
or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable
law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental
Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture,
agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its

Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.04.  Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.   (a) The
Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet

in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence
of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.

ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such
properties for their intended purposes or have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to
use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents, trade styles, service
marks and all applications, registrations and recordings relating to any of the
foregoing, and all other intellectual property material to its business, and the
use thereof by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the
rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.06.  Litigation and Environmental Matters.  (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

(b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to
obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required
under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental
Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any

and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of
any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,
agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where
the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any indenture, agreement or other instrument, any
charter or other corporate restriction or any law, regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority which could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.  No Default has occurred and is continuing.

SECTION 3.08.  Investment and Holding Company Status.  Neither the Borrower
nor any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a
"holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have been
filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by
it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and for which the Borrower or such

<PAGE>

Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b)
to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.10.  ERISA.  No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.  The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair
market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the
assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting
such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded
Plans.

SECTION 3.11.  Use of Proceeds; and Board Regulations.

(a) The Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not engaged principally in,
nor have as one of their important activities, the business of extending credit
for the purpose of or carrying any "margin stock" (within the meaning of
Regulation U of the Board as amended to the date hereof).  If requested by the
Bank, the Borrower or any Subsidiary will furnish to the Bank such a statement
on Board Form U-1.

(b) The proceeds of each Loan will be used by the Borrower for working
capital in the ordinary course of business.  No part of the proceeds of any Loan
will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether immediately,
incidental or ultimately, (i) to purchase or to carry margin stock or to extend
credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock, or to
refund indebtedness originally incurred for such purpose, or (ii) for any
purpose which violates or is inconsistent with the provisions of Regulations G,
T, U or X of the Board.

SECTION 3.12.  Subsidiaries.  Schedule 3.12 to this Agreement has a
complete and correct list of each of the Borrower's Subsidiaries, showing as to
each such Subsidiary its name, the jurisdiction of its incorporation and the
number and percentages of outstanding shares of such Subsidiary owned by the
Borrower and other Subsidiaries, respectively.

SECTION 3.13.  Disclosure.  The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to it, that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.  None of the reports, financial statements,
certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other
information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that,
with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only
that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed
to be reasonable at the time.

ARTICLE VIII

The Administrative Agent

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving
as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent
shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i)
any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the

<PAGE>

performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or
genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or
(v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere
herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which
shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any
such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative
Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was
acting as Administrative Agent.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and

<PAGE>

information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

SECTION 9.02.  Waivers; Amendments.  (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or
power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The
rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or
consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section,
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

<PAGE>

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the

such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
written consent of such Lender, (ii) increase the aggregate amount of all
Lenders' Commitments, (iii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC
Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable

postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC
Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce
the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date
of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender
affected thereby, (v) change Section 2.16(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter
the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent
of each Lender, (vi) consent to an amendment to or waiver of Sections 6.01,
6.03, 6.04, 6.06, 6.07 or 6.13, or (vii) change any of the provisions of this
Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or
modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
hereunder, without the  written consent of each Lender; provided further that no
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

SECTION 9.03.  Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.  (a) The Borrower shall
pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and

syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and
administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of
the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal
or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and
(iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with
the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-
pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in
respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons
(each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan
or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal
by the

<PAGE>

Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the
documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with
the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or
release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in
any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required
to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank under paragraph
(a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
after written demand therefor.

SECTION 9.04.  Successors and Assigns.  (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing
Bank that issues any Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated
hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

(b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided  that (i) except
in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, each of
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of an assignment of
all or a portion of a Commitment or any Lender's obligations in respect of its
LC Exposure, the Issuing Bank) must give their

<PAGE>

prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or
an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning
Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment
and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iv) the parties
to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and provided further that
any consent of the Borrower otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be
required if an Event of Default under clause (i) or (j) of Article VII has
occurred and is continuing.  Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03).  Any assignment or transfer by
a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (e) of this Section.

(c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes
of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall
be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at
any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

(e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or more
banks or other

<PAGE>

entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
9.02(b) that affects such Participant.  Subject to paragraph (f) of this
Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16(c) as though it were a
Lender.

(f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent.

(g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

SECTION 9.05.  Survival.  All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments  delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans
and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by
any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired
or terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article
VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

SECTION 9.06.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of

<PAGE>

which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall
constitute a single contract.  This Agreement and any separate letter agreements
with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire
contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement
shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative
Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof
which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties
hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.07.  Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

SECTION 9.08.  Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured.  The rights of each Lender under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

SECTION 9.09.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law
of the State of New York.

(b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States
District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New
York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court.  Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement
shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

<PAGE>

(c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in
paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01, provided that
service of process by telecopy is not consented to by any party hereto.  Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

SECTION 9.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 9.11.  Headings.  Article and Section headings are for convenience
of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the
construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

SECTION 9.12.  Confidentiality.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to
its and its Affiliates' Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to
whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any assignee of
or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrower
or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than
as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Borrower.  For the purposes of this Section,

"Information" means all information received from the Borrower relating to the
Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis prior to

<PAGE>

disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received
from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified
at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

SECTION 9.13.  Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

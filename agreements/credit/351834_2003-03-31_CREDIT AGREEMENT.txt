CREDIT AGREEMENT

This Credit Agreement is entered into as of November 25, 2002, by and
among Stake Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the
financial institutions from time to time party to this Agreement, as Lenders,
and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Administrative Agent as provided herein.
All capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the same
meanings herein as such terms are defined in Section 5.1 hereof.


PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

The Borrower has requested, and the Lenders have agreed to extend, a
tender facility on the terms and conditions of this Agreement to enable the
Borrower to purchase 100% of the stock of Opta Food Ingredients, Inc. (the
"Target").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

SECTION 1. THE TENDER FACILITY.

Section 1.1. Term Loan Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each Lender, by its acceptance hereof, severally agrees to make a loan
(individually a "Term Loan" and collectively for all the Lenders the "Term
Loans") in U.S. Dollars to the Borrower in an amount up to such Lender's Term
Loan Commitment. The initial Borrowing hereunder shall be made no later than
December 19, 2002 (unless extended pursuant to the mutual agreement of the
Borrower and the Lenders), otherwise the Term Loan Commitments shall expire. The
Term Loans shall be made ratably by the Lenders in proportion to their
respective Term Loan Percentages. As provided in Section 1.4(a) hereof, the
Borrower may elect that advances of the Term Loans be outstanding as Base Rate
Loans or Eurodollar Loans. No amount repaid or prepaid on any Term Loan may be
borrowed again.

Section 1.2. Applicable Interest Rates. (a) Base Rate Loans. Each Base
Rate Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest during each
Interest Period it is outstanding (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days,
and the actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the
date such Loan is advanced, continued or created by conversion from a Eurodollar
Loan until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time
in effect, payable on the last day of its Interest Period and at maturity
(whether by acceleration or otherwise).

"Base Rate" means for any day the greater of: (i) the rate of interest
announced or otherwise established by the Administrative Agent from time to time
as its prime commercial rate as in effect on such day, with any change in the
Base Rate resulting from a change in said prime commercial rate to be effective
as of the date of the relevant change in said prime


<PAGE>


commercial rate (it being acknowledged and agreed that such rate may not be the
Administrative Agent's best or lowest rate) and (ii) the sum of (x) the rate
determined by the Administrative Agent to be the average (rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) of the rates per annum quoted to the
Administrative Agent at approximately 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) (or as soon
thereafter as is practicable) on such day (or, if such day is not a Business
Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day) by two or more Federal funds
brokers selected by the Administrative Agent for sale to the Administrative
Agent at face value of Federal funds in the secondary market in an amount equal
or comparable to the principal amount owed to the Administrative Agent for which
such rate is being determined, plus (y) 1/2 of 1%.

(b) Eurodollar Loans. Each Eurodollar Loan made or maintained by a Lender
shall bear interest during each Interest Period it is outstanding (computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal
amount thereof from the date such Loan is advanced, continued or created by
conversion from a Base Rate Loan until maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus
the Adjusted LIBOR applicable for such Interest Period, payable on the last day
of the Interest Period and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise),
and, if the applicable Interest Period is longer than three months, on each day
occurring every three months after the commencement of such Interest Period.

"Adjusted LIBOR" means, for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, a rate per
annum determined in accordance with the following formula:

Adjusted LIBOR   =               LIBOR
1 - Eurodollar Reserve Percentage

"Eurodollar Reserve Percentage" means, for any Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans, the daily average for the applicable Interest Period of the maximum rate,
expressed as a decimal, at which reserves (including, without limitation, any
supplemental, marginal, and emergency reserves) are imposed during such Interest
Period by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any
successor) on "eurocurrency liabilities", as defined in such Board's Regulation
D (or in respect of any other category of liabilities that includes deposits by
reference to which the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined or any
category of extensions of credit or other assets that include loans by
non-United States offices of any Lender to United States residents), subject to
any amendments of such reserve requirement by such Board or its successor,
taking into account any transitional adjustments thereto. For purposes of this
definition, the Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be "eurocurrency
liabilities" as defined in Regulation D without benefit or credit for any
prorations, exemptions or offsets under Regulation D.

"LIBOR" means, for an Interest Period for a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans,
(a) the LIBOR Index Rate for such Interest Period, if such rate is available,
and (b) if the LIBOR Index Rate cannot be determined, the arithmetic average of
the rates of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest
1/100 of 1%) at which deposits in U.S. Dollars in immediately available funds
are offered to the Administrative Agent at 11:00 a.m. (London, England time) 2
Business Days before the beginning of such Interest Period by 3 or more major


<PAGE>


banks in the interbank eurodollar market selected by the Administrative Agent
for delivery on the first day of and for a period equal to such Interest Period
and in an amount equal or comparable to the principal amount of the Eurodollar
Loan scheduled to be made by the Administrative Agent as part of such Borrowing.

"LIBOR Index Rate" means, for any Interest Period, the rate per annum
(rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next higher one hundred-thousandth of a
percentage point) for deposits in U.S. Dollars for a period equal to such
Interest Period, which appears on the Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m.
(London, England time) on the day 2 Business Days before the commencement of
such Interest Period.

"Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page 3750" on the
Telerate Service (or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service or
such other service as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association as
the information vendor for the purpose of displaying British Bankers'
Association Interest Settlement Rates for U.S. Dollar deposits).

(c) Rate Determinations. The Administrative Agent shall determine each
interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder, and its determination thereof
shall be conclusive and binding except in the case of manifest error.

Section 1.3. Minimum Borrowing Amounts; Maximum Eurodollar Loans. Each
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans advanced under a Credit shall be in an amount not
less than $100,000. Each Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans advanced, continued or
converted under a Credit shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or such
greater amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000. Without the
Administrative Agent's consent, there shall not be more than three (3)
Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans outstanding at any one time.

Section 1.4. Manner of Borrowing Loans and Designating Applicable Interest
Rates. (a) Notice to the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall give notice to
the Administrative Agent by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time): (i) at
least 3 Business Days before the date on which the Borrower requests the Lenders
to advance a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans and (ii) on the date the Borrower
requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. The Loans
included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate
specified in such notice of a new Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower may from
time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each
Borrowing or, subject to Section 1.3's minimum amount requirement for each
outstanding Borrowing, a portion thereof, as follows: (i) if such Borrowing is
of Eurodollar Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
the Borrower may continue part or all of such Borrowing as Eurodollar Loans or
convert part or all of such Borrowing into Base Rate Loans or (ii) if such
Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, on any Business Day, the Borrower may convert
all or part of such Borrowing into Eurodollar Loans for an Interest Period or
Interest Periods specified by the Borrower. The Borrower shall give all such
notices requesting the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent by telephone or telecopy (which notice shall be irrevocable
once given and, if by telephone, shall be promptly confirmed in writing),
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (Notice of Borrowing) or
Exhibit B (Notice of Continuation/Conversion), as applicable, or in such other
form acceptable to the


<PAGE>


Administrative Agent. Notice of the continuation of a Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans for an additional Interest Period or of the conversion of part or all of a
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans must be given by no later
than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least 3 Business Days before the date of the
requested continuation or conversion. All such notices concerning the advance,
continuation or conversion of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the
requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be a
Business Day), the amount of the requested Borrowing to be advanced, continued
or converted, the type of Loans to comprise such new, continued or converted
Borrowing and, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurodollar Loans, the
Interest Period applicable thereto. The Borrower agrees that the Administrative
Agent may rely on any such telephonic or telecopy notice given by any person the
Administrative Agent in good faith believes is an Authorized Representative
without the necessity of independent investigation and, in the event any such
notice by telephone conflicts with any written confirmation, such telephonic
notice shall govern if the Administrative Agent has acted in reliance thereon.

(b) Notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt
telephonic or telecopy notice to each Lender of any notice from the Borrower
received pursuant to Section 1.4(a) above and, if such notice requests the
Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans, the Administrative Agent shall give notice to
the Borrower and each Lender by like means of the interest rate applicable
thereto promptly after the Administrative Agent has made such determination.

(c) Borrower's Failure to Notify; Automatic Continuations and Conversions.
Any outstanding Borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall automatically be continued
for an additional Interest Period on the last day of its then current Interest
Period unless the Borrower has notified the Administrative Agent within the
period required by Section 1.4(a) that the Borrower intends to convert such
Borrowing, subject to Section 7.1 hereof, into a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans
or such Borrowing is prepaid in accordance with Section 1.7(a). If the Borrower
fails to give notice pursuant to Section 1.4(a) above of the continuation or
conversion of any outstanding principal amount of a Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans before the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period
required by Section 1.4(a) or, whether or not such notice has been given, one or
more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 for the continuation or
conversion of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans would not be satisfied, and such
Borrowing is not prepaid in accordance with Section 1.7(a), such Borrowing shall
automatically be converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.

(d) Disbursement of Loans. Not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the
date of any requested advance of a new Borrowing, subject to Section 7 hereof,
each Lender shall make available its Loan comprising part of such Borrowing in
funds immediately available at the principal office of the Administrative Agent
in Chicago, Illinois. The Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of each
new Borrowing available to the Borrower at the Administrative Agent's principal
office in Chicago, Illinois.

(e) Administrative Agent Reliance on Lender Funding. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to (or, in the
case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, by 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on) the date
on which such Lender is scheduled to make


<PAGE>


payment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Loan (which notice
shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
payment when due and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the Borrower the
proceeds of the Loan to be made by such Lender and, if any Lender has not in
fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on
demand, pay to the Administrative Agent the amount made available to the
Borrower attributable to such Lender together with interest thereon in respect
of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made
available to the Borrower and ending on (but excluding) the date such Lender
pays such amount to the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to: (i)
from the date the related advance was made by the Administrative Agent to the
date 2 Business Days after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, the Federal
Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from the date 2 Business Days after the
date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made by
such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. If such amount is not
received from such Lender by the Administrative Agent immediately upon demand,
the Borrower will, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of
the Loan attributable to such Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum
equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan, but without such
payment being considered a payment or prepayment of a Loan under Section 1.10
hereof so that the Borrower will have no liability under such Section with
respect to such payment.

Section 1.5. Interest Periods. As provided in Section 1.4(a) hereof, at
the time of each request to advance, continue or create by conversion a
Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, the Borrower shall select an Interest Period
applicable to such Loans from among the available options. The term "Interest
Period" means the period commencing on the date a Borrowing of Loans is
advanced, continued or created by conversion and ending: (a) in the case of Base
Rate Loans, on the last day of the calendar month in which such Borrowing is
advanced, continued or created by conversion (or on the last day of the
following calendar month if such Loan is advanced, continued or created by
conversion on the last day of a calendar month), and (b) in the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, one (1) month or 45 days or two (2) months thereafter;
provided, however, that:

(a) any Interest Period for a Borrowing of Term Loans consisting of
Base Rate Loans that otherwise would end after the final maturity date of
the Term Loans shall end on the final maturity date of the Term Loans;

(b) no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the Term Loans
shall extend beyond the final maturity date of the Term Loans;

(c) whenever the last day of any Interest Period would otherwise be
a day that is not a Business Day, the last day of such Interest Period
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, provided that, if
such extension would cause the last day of an Interest Period for a
Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans to occur in the following calendar month,
the last day of such Interest Period shall be the immediately preceding
Business Day; and


<PAGE>


(d) for purposes of determining an Interest Period for a Borrowing
of Eurodollar Loans, a month means a period starting on one day in a
calendar month and ending on the numerically corresponding day in the next
calendar month; provided, however, that if there is no numerically
corresponding day in the month in which such an Interest Period is to end
or if such an Interest Period begins on the last Business Day of a
calendar month, then such Interest Period shall end on the last Business
Day of the calendar month in which such Interest Period is to end.

Section 1.6. Maturity of Loans. The Borrower shall make a final payment of
both principal and interest not sooner paid on the Term Loans 60 days after the
date of the initial Borrowing hereunder (the "Term Loan Final Maturity Date"),
the final maturity thereof. Such principal payment shall be applied to the
Lenders holding the Term Loans pro rata based upon their Term Loan Percentages.

Section 1.7. Prepayments. (a) Optional. The Borrower shall have the
privilege of prepaying without premium or penalty (except as set forth in
Section 1.10 below) and in whole or in part (but, if in part, then: (i) if such
Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, in an amount not less than $100,000, (ii) if
such Borrowing is of Eurodollar Loans, in an amount not less than $500,000, and
(iii) in each case, in an amount such that the minimum amount required for a
Borrowing pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof remains outstanding) any Borrowing of
Eurodollar Loans at any time upon 3 Business Days prior notice by the Borrower
to the Administrative Agent or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans,
notice delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00
a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of prepayment, such prepayment to be made by the
payment of the principal amount to be prepaid and accrued interest thereon to
the date fixed for prepayment plus any amounts due the Lenders under Section
1.10 hereof.

(b) Mandatory. (i) If the Borrower shall at any time or from time to time
receive any dividends from the capital stock of the Target, then the Borrower
shall promptly upon receipt shall prepay the Term Loans in an aggregate amount
equal to 100% of the amount of all such dividends.

(ii) Unless the Borrower otherwise directs, prepayments of Loans under
this Section 1.7(b) shall be applied first to Borrowings of Base Rate Loans
until payment in full thereof with any balance applied to Borrowings of
Eurodollar Loans in the order in which their Interest Periods expire. Each
prepayment of Loans under this Section 1.7(b) shall be made by the payment of
the principal amount to be prepaid and, in the case of any Term Loans or
Eurodollar Loans, accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment together
with any amounts due the Lenders under Section 1.10 hereof.

(c) The Administrative Agent will promptly advise each Lender of any
notice of prepayment it receives from the Borrower. No amount of the Term Loans
paid or prepaid may be reborrowed, and, in the case of any partial prepayment,
such prepayment shall be applied to the relevant Term Loans in the reverse order
of maturity.


<PAGE>


Section 1.8. Default Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 1.4 hereof, while any Event of Default exists or after
acceleration, the Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as before entry of
judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of all
Loans owing by it at a rate per annum equal to:

(a) for any Base Rate Loan, the sum of 2.0% plus the Applicable
Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect; and

(b) for any Eurodollar Loan, the sum of 2.0% plus the rate of
interest in effect thereon at the time of such default until the end of
the Interest Period applicable thereto and, thereafter, at a rate per
annum equal to the sum of 2.0% plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate
Loans plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect;

provided, however, that in the absence of acceleration, any adjustments pursuant
to this Section shall be made at the election of the Administrative Agent,
acting at the request or with the consent of the Required Lenders, with written
notice to the Borrower. While any Event of Default exists or after acceleration,
interest shall be paid on demand of the Administrative Agent at the request or
with the consent of the Required Lenders.

Section 1.9. The Notes. (a) The advances of the Term Loan made to the
Borrower by a Lender shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the
Borrower issued to such Lender in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Each such
promissory note is hereinafter referred to as a "Term Note" and collectively
such promissory notes are referred to as the "Term Notes."

(b) Each Lender shall record on its books and records or on a schedule to
its Note the amount of each Loan advanced, continued or converted by it, all
payments of principal and interest and the principal balance from time to time
outstanding thereon, the type of such Loan, and, for any Eurodollar Loan, the
Interest Period and the interest rate applicable thereto. The record thereof,
whether shown on such books and records of a Lender or on a schedule to the
relevant Note, shall be prima facie evidence as to all such matters; provided,
however, that the failure of any Lender to record any of the foregoing or any
error in any such record shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of
the Borrower to repay all Loans made to it hereunder together with accrued

contravene or constitute a default under any covenant, indenture, or agreement
of or affecting such Person or any of its Property where such contravention or
default could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, Property, business, or operations of such Person, or (c)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any such Person's Property.
No authorization, consent, license, or exemption from, or filing or registration
with, any court or governmental department, agency, or instrumentality, nor any
approval or consent of any other Person, is or will be necessary to the valid
execution, delivery, or performance by the Borrower, Stake or, to the best of
the Borrower's knowledge, the Target of the Certificate or Merger or of any
other instrument or document executed and delivered in connection therewith,
except for such thereof that have heretofore been obtained and remain in full
force and effect. Neither of the Borrower, Stake nor, to the best of the
Borrower's knowledge, the Target are in default in any material respect of their
respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.

is continuing, the Lenders may, by written notice to the Borrower: (a) terminate
the remaining Commitments and all other obligations of the Lenders hereunder on

<PAGE>


date thereof); and (b) declare the principal of and the accrued interest on all
outstanding Notes to be forthwith due and payable and thereupon all outstanding
Notes, including both principal and interest thereon, shall be and become

kind. The Administrative Agent, after giving notice to the Borrower pursuant to

hereunder or in connection with the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents
(including all such costs and expenses incurred in connection with any
proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code involving the Borrower as a
debtor thereunder).

SECTION 10. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES.

Section 10.1. Change of Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement or any Note, if at any time any change in applicable law or regulation
or in the interpretation thereof makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or
continue to maintain any Eurodollar Loans or to perform its obligations as
contemplated hereby, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the
Borrower and such Lender's obligations to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans
under this Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such
Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans. The Borrower shall prepay on demand
the outstanding principal amount of any such affected Eurodollar Loans, together
with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to
such Lender under this Agreement; provided, however, subject to all of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may then elect to borrow the
principal amount of the affected Eurodollar Loans from such Lender by means of
Base Rate Loans from such Lender, which Base Rate Loans shall not be made
ratably by the Lenders but only from such affected Lender.


<PAGE>


Section 10.2. Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain, or
Inadequacy of, LIBOR. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for
any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans:

(a) the Administrative Agent determines that deposits in U.S.
Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to it in the
interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period, or that by reason of
circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR, or

(b) the Required Lenders advise the Administrative Agent that (i)
LIBOR as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding their Eurodollar Loans
for such Interest Period or (ii) that the making or funding of Eurodollar
Loans become impracticable,

then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the
Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist,
the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended.

Section 10.3. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If, on or after the
date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its
Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force
of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

(i) shall subject any Lender (or its Lending Office) to any tax,
duty or other charge with respect to its Eurodollar Loans, its Notes or
its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or shall change the basis of
taxation of payments to any Lender (or its Lending Office) of the
principal of or interest on its Eurodollar Loans, or any other amounts due
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in respect of its
Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans (except for
changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender or its
Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's
principal executive office or Lending Office is located); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement (including, without limitation, any such
requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, but excluding with respect to any Eurodollar Loans any such
requirement included in an applicable Eurodollar Reserve Percentage)
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended
by, any Lender (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on any Lender (or
its Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition
affecting its Eurodollar Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make
Eurodollar Loans;


<PAGE>


and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan, or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its
Lending Office) under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document with
respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, within
15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

(b) If, after the date hereof, any Lender or the Administrative
Agent shall have determined that the adoption of any applicable law, rule
or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or
its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender with any
request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency,
has had the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such
corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a
level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved
but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from
time to time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
reduction.

(c) A certificate of a Lender claiming compensation under this
Section 10.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid
to it hereunder shall be conclusive if reasonably determined. In
determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

Section 10.4. Lending Offices. Each Lender may, at its option, elect to
make its Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified on the
appropriate signature page hereof (each a "Lending Office") for each type of
Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates
as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written notice to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent. To the extent reasonably possible, a
Lender shall designate an alternative branch or funding office with respect to
its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender
under Section 10.3 hereof or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Loans
under Section 10.2 hereof, so long as such designation is not otherwise
disadvantageous to the Lender.

Section 10.5. Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender shall be
entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any
manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this
Agreement all determinations hereunder with respect to Eurodollar Loans shall be
made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan
through the purchase of deposits in the interbank eurodollar market having a
maturity corresponding to such Loan's Interest Period, and bearing an interest
rate equal to LIBOR for such Interest Period.


<PAGE>


SECTION 11. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

Section 11.1. Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent. Each
Lender hereby appoints Harris Trust and Savings Bank as the Administrative Agent
under the Loan Documents and hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to take
such action as Administrative Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the
terms thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The Lenders expressly agree that the Administrative Agent is not acting as a
fiduciary of the Lenders in respect of the Loan Documents, the Borrower or
otherwise, and nothing herein or in any of the other Loan Documents shall result
in any duties or obligations on the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders
except as expressly set forth herein.

Section 11.2. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates. The Administrative
Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising
such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the
Administrative Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Affiliate
of the Borrower as if it were not the Administrative Agent under the Loan
Documents. The term "Lender" as used herein and in all other Loan Documents,
unless the context otherwise clearly requires, includes the Administrative Agent
in its individual capacity as a Lender. References in Section 1 hereof to the
Administrative Agent's Loans, or to the amount owing to the Administrative Agent
for which an interest rate is being determined, refer to the Administrative
Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender.

Section 11.3. Action by Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent
receives from the Borrower a written notice of an Event of Default, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly give each of the Lenders written notice
thereof. The obligations of the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents
are only those expressly set forth therein. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action
hereunder with respect to any Default or Event of Default, except as expressly
provided in Section 9.2. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the
Administrative Agent shall take such action to enforce its Lien on the
Collateral and to preserve and protect the Collateral as may be directed by the
Required Lenders. In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent be
required to take any action in violation of applicable law or of any provision
of any Loan Document, and the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan
Document unless it first receives any further assurances of its indemnification
from the Lenders that it may require, including prepayment of any related
expenses and any other protection it requires against any and all costs,
expense, and liability which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to assume that no Default or Event of Default exists unless notified in writing
to the contrary by a Lender or the Borrower. In all cases in which the Loan
Documents do not require the Administrative Agent to take specific action, the
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in using its discretion in failing
to take or in taking any action thereunder. Any instructions of the Required
Lenders, or of any other group of


<PAGE>

Lenders called for under the specific provisions of the Loan Documents, shall be
binding upon all the Lenders and the holders of the Obligations.

Section 11.4. Consultation with Experts. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants, and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants or experts.

Section 11.5. Liability of Administrative Agent; Credit Decision. Neither
the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the
Loan Documents: (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders
or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or
employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into
or verify: (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with
this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Credit Event; (ii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower
or any Subsidiary contained herein or in any other Loan Document; (iii) the
satisfaction of any condition specified in Section 7 hereof, except receipt of
items required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent; or (iv) the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, perfection, value, worth
or collectibility hereof or of any other Loan Document or of any other documents
or writing furnished in connection with any Loan Document or of any Collateral;
and the Administrative Agent makes no representation of any kind or character
with respect to any such matter mentioned in this sentence. The Administrative
Agent may execute any of its duties under any of the Loan Documents by or
through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to
the Lenders, the Borrower, or any other Person for the default or misconduct of
any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected with reasonable care. The
Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon
any notice, consent, certificate, other document or statement (whether written
or oral) believed by it to be genuine or to be sent by the proper party or
parties. In particular and without limiting any of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for confirming the accuracy of
any compliance certificate or other document or instrument received by it under
the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent may treat the payee of any Note as
the holder thereof until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with
the Administrative Agent signed by such payee in form satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has independently and
without reliance on the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based upon
such information, investigations and inquiries as it deems appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to extend credit to the Borrower in the manner
set forth in the Loan Documents. It shall be the responsibility of each Lender
to keep itself informed as to the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, and the Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Lender
with respect thereto.

Section 11.6. Indemnity. The Lenders shall ratably, in accordance with
their respective Percentages, indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent, and
its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives harmless from
and against any liabilities, losses, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by
it under any Loan Document or in connection with the transactions contemplated
thereby, regardless of when asserted or arising, except to the extent they are


<PAGE>


promptly reimbursed for the same by the Borrower and except to the extent that
any event giving rise to a claim was caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the party seeking to be indemnified. The obligations of the
Lenders under this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to offset amounts received for the
account of a Lender under this Agreement against unpaid amounts due from such
Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether as fundings of
participations, indemnities or otherwise), but shall not be entitled to offset
against amounts owed to the Administrative Agent by any Lender arising outside
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

Section 11.7. Resignation of Administrative Agent and Successor
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the
right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and
shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which may be any Lender hereunder or any commercial bank
organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof
and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $200,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder, such
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all the rights and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent under the Loan
Documents, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations thereunder. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 11
and all protective provisions of the other Loan Documents shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent, but no successor Administrative Agent shall in any event
be liable or responsible for any actions of its predecessor. If the
Administrative Agent resigns and no successor is appointed, the rights and
obligations of such Administrative Agent shall be automatically assumed by the
Required Lenders and (i) the Borrower shall be directed to make all payments due
each Lender hereunder directly to such Lender and (ii) the Administrative
Agent's rights in the Collateral Documents shall be assigned without
representation, recourse or warranty to the Lenders as their interests may
appear.

SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS.

Section 12.1. Withholding Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Withholding. Except
as otherwise required by law and subject to Section 12.1(b) hereof, each payment
by the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be made
without withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes (other than
overall net income taxes on the recipient) imposed by or within the jurisdiction
in which the Borrower is domiciled, any jurisdiction from which the Borrower
makes any payment, or (in each case) any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein. If any such withholding is so required, the
Borrower shall make the withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate
governmental authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues
thereon and forthwith pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure
that the net amount actually received by each Lender and the Administrative


<PAGE>


Agent free and clear of such taxes (including such taxes on such additional
amount) is equal to the amount which that Lender or the Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) would have received had such withholding not been made. If the
Administrative Agent or any Lender pays any amount in respect of any such taxes,
penalties or interest, the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent or
such Lender for that payment on demand in the currency in which such payment was
made. If the Borrower pays any such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall
deliver official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies
thereof to the Lender or Administrative Agent on whose account such withholding
was made (with a copy to the Administrative Agent if not the recipient of the
original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment.

(b) U.S. Withholding Tax Exemptions. Each Lender that is not a United
States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall
submit to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date the
initial Credit Event is made hereunder or, if later, the date such financial
institution becomes a Lender hereunder, two duly completed and signed copies of
(i) either Form W-8 BEN (relating to such Lender and entitling it to a complete
exemption from withholding under the Code on all amounts to be received by such
Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) or
Form W-8 ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Lender, including
fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) of the United States
Internal Revenue Service or (ii) solely if such Lender is claiming exemption
from United States withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code
with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8 BEN, or any
successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and a certificate
representing that such Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of
the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section
871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign
corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of
the Code). Thereafter and from time to time, each Lender shall submit to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed
copies of one or the other of such Forms (or such successor forms as shall be
adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) and
such other certificates as may be (i) requested by the Borrower in a written
notice, directly or through the Administrative Agent, to such Lender and (ii)
required under then-current United States law or regulations to avoid or reduce
United States withholding taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be
received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents or the
Obligations. Upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each
Lender that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a United States person.

(c) Inability of Lender to Submit Forms. If any Lender determines, as a
result of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any official
application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to submit to the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent any form or certificate that such Lender is
obligated to submit pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 12.1 or that such
Lender is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously
submitted or any such form or certificate otherwise becomes ineffective or
inaccurate, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and Administrative
Agent of such fact and the Lender


<PAGE>


shall to that extent not be obligated to provide any such form or certificate
and will be entitled to withdraw or cancel any affected form or certificate, as
applicable.

Section 12.2. No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies. No delay or failure on the
part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on the part of the holder or
holders of any of the Obligations in the exercise of any power or right under
any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence in any
default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or
right. The rights and remedies hereunder of the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders and of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations are cumulative
to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would
otherwise have.

Section 12.3. Non-Business Days. If any payment hereunder becomes due and
payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day on which date such payment shall
be due and payable. In the case of any payment of principal falling due on a day
which is not a Business Day, interest on such principal amount shall continue to
accrue during such extension at the rate per annum then in effect, which accrued
amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of
interest.

Section 12.4. Documentary Taxes. The Borrower agrees to pay on demand any
documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable in respect of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, including interest and penalties, in the event any such
taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such assessment is made and whether or
not any credit is then in use or available hereunder.

Section 12.5. Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties made herein or in any other Loan Document or in certificates given
pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall continue in full force and
effect with respect to the date as of which they were made as long as any credit
is in use or available hereunder.

Section 12.6. Survival of Indemnities. All indemnities and other
provisions relative to reimbursement to the Lenders of amounts sufficient to
protect the yield of the Lenders with respect to the Loans, including, but not
limited to, Sections 1.10, 10.3, and 12.15 hereof, shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the payment of the
Obligations.

Section 12.7. Sharing of Set-Off. Each Lender agrees with each other
Lender a party hereto that if such Lender shall receive and retain any payment,
whether by set-off or application of deposit balances or otherwise, on any of
the Loans in excess of its ratable share of payments on all such Obligations
then outstanding to the Lenders, then such Lender shall purchase for cash at
face value, but without recourse, ratably from each of the other Lenders such
amount of the Loans held by each such other Lenders (or interest therein) as
shall be necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess payment ratably
with all the other Lenders; provided, however, that if any such purchase is made
by any Lender, and if such excess payment or part thereof is


<PAGE>


thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the related purchases from the
other Lenders shall be rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to
the portion of such excess payment so recovered, but without interest.

Section 12.8. Notices. Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be in writing (including,
without limitation, notice by telecopy) and shall be given to the relevant party
at its address or telecopier number set forth below, or such other address or
telecopier number as such party may hereafter specify by notice to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower given by courier, by United States
certified or registered mail, by telecopy or by other telecommunication device
capable of creating a written record of such notice and its receipt. Notices
under the Loan Documents to the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be
addressed to their respective addresses or telecopier numbers set forth on the
signature pages hereof, and to the Borrower to:

such telecopy has been received by the sender, (ii) if given by mail, 5 days
after such communication is deposited in the mail, certified or registered with
return receipt requested, addressed as aforesaid or (iii) if given by any other
means, when delivered at the addresses specified in this Section or on the
signature pages hereof; provided that any notice given pursuant to Section 1
hereof shall be effective only upon receipt.

Section 12.9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, and by the different parties hereto on separate counterpart
signature pages, and all such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 12.10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit
of the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders and the benefit of their
respective successors and assigns, including any subsequent holder of any of the
Obligations. The Borrower may not assign any of


<PAGE>


its rights or obligations under any Loan Document without the written consent of
all of the Lenders.

Section 12.11. Participants. Each Lender shall have the right at its own
cost to grant participations (to be evidenced by one or more agreements or
certificates of participation) in the Loans made and/or Commitments held by such
Lender at any time and from time to time to one or more other Persons; provided
that no such participation shall relieve any Lender of any of its obligations
under this Agreement, and, provided, further that no such participant shall have
any rights under this Agreement except as provided in this Section, and the
Administrative Agent shall have no obligation or responsibility to such
participant. Any agreement pursuant to which such participation is granted shall
provide that the granting Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility
to enforce the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents including, without limitation, the right to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, except
that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree to any
modification, amendment or waiver of the Loan Documents that would reduce the
amount of or postpone any fixed date for payment of any Obligation in which such
participant has an interest. Any party to which such a participation has been
granted shall have the benefits of Section 1.10 and Section 10.3 hereof. The
Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any participant or prospective
participant under this Section any financial or other information pertaining to
the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

Section 12.12. Assignments. (a) Each Lender shall have the right at any
time and, so long as no Event of Default then exists, with the consent of the
Borrower (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld) to
sell, assign, transfer or negotiate all or any part of its rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the
indebtedness evidenced by the Notes then held by such assigning Lender, together
with an equivalent percentage of its obligation to make Loans) to one or more
commercial banks or other financial institutions or investors, provided that
such assignment shall be of a fixed percentage (and not by its terms of varying
percentage) of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
Documents; provided, however, that in order to make any such assignment (i)
unless the assigning Lender is assigning all of its Commitments and outstanding
Loans, the assigning Lender shall retain at least $3,000,000 in unused
Commitments and outstanding Loans, (ii) the assignee Lender shall have
Commitments and outstanding Loans, (iii) each such assignment shall be evidenced
by a written agreement (substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D
or in such other form acceptable to the Administrative Agent) executed by such
assigning Lender, such assignee Lender or Lenders, the Administrative Agent and,
if required as provided above, the Borrower, which agreement shall specify in
each instance the portion of the Obligations which are to be assigned to the
assignee Lender and the portion of the Commitments of the assigning Lender to be
assumed by the assignee Lender, and (iv) the assigning Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent a processing fee of $3,500 and any out-of-pocket attorneys'
fees and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any
such assignment agreement. Any such assignee shall become a Lender for all
purposes hereunder to the extent of the rights and obligations under the Loan
Documents it assumes and the assigning Lender shall be released from its
obligations, and will have released its rights, under the Loan Documents to the
extent of such assignment. The address for notices to such assignee Lender shall
be as specified in the assignment agreement executed by it. Promptly upon the


<PAGE>


effectiveness of any such assignment agreement, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver replacement Notes to the assignee Lender and the assigning Lender in the
respective amounts of their Commitments (or assigned principal amounts, as
applicable) after giving effect to the reduction occasioned by such assignment
(all such Notes to constitute "Notes" for all purposes of the Loan Documents),
and the assignee Lender shall thereafter surrender to the Borrower its old
Notes. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any purchaser or
prospective purchaser of an interest in the Loans owed to it or its Commitments
under this Section any financial or other information pertaining to the
Borrower.

(b) Any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including any such pledge or grant to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this
Section shall not apply to any such pledge or grant of a security interest;
provided that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
secured party for such Lender as a party hereto; provided further, however, the
right of any such pledgee or grantee (other than any Federal Reserve Bank) to
further transfer all or any portion of the rights pledged or granted to it,
whether by means of foreclosure or otherwise, shall be at all times subject to
the terms of this Agreement.

Section 12.13. Amendments. Any provision of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or
waiver is in writing and is signed by (a) the Borrower, (b) the Required
Lenders, and (c) if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are
affected thereby, the Administrative Agent; provided that:

(i) no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 12.13 shall (A)
increase any Commitment of any Lender without the consent of such Lender
or (B) reduce the amount of or postpone the date for any scheduled payment
of any principal of or interest on any Loan or of any fee payable
hereunder without the consent of the Lender to which such payment is owing
or which has committed to make such Loan hereunder; and

(ii) no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 12.13 shall,
unless signed by each Lender, increase the aggregate Commitments of the
Lenders, change the definitions of Term Loan Final Maturity Date or
Required Lenders, change the provisions of this Section 12.13, release any
material guarantor or any substantial part of the Collateral (except as
otherwise provided for in the Loan Documents), or affect the number of
Lenders required to take any action hereunder or under any other Loan
Document.

Section 12.14. Headings. Section headings used in this Agreement are for
reference only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.

Section 12.15. Costs and Expenses; Indemnification. The Borrower agrees to
pay all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and Lenders in connection
with the preparation, negotiation, syndication, and administration of the Loan
Documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, in connection with the
preparation and execution of the Loan Documents, and any


<PAGE>


amendment, waiver or consent related thereto, whether or not the transactions
contemplated herein are consummated, together with any fees and charges suffered
or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with title
insurance policies, collateral filing fees and lien searches. The Borrower
further agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender, and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, financial advisors, and
consultants against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments,
liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable expenses
of litigation or preparation therefor, whether or not the indemnified Person is
a party thereto, or any settlement arrangement arising from or relating to any
such litigation) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating
to any Loan Document or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or the
direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any
Loan, other than those which arise from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the party claiming indemnification. The Borrower, upon demand by
the Administrative Agent or a Lender at any time, shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent or such Lender for any legal or other expenses incurred in
connection with investigating or defending against any of the foregoing
(including any settlement costs relating to the foregoing) except if the same is
directly due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be
indemnified. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall survive
the termination of this Agreement.

Section 12.16. Set-off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default, each Lender and each subsequent holder of
any Obligation is hereby authorized by the Borrower at any time or from time to
time, without notice to the Borrower or to any other Person, any such notice
being hereby expressly waived, to set-off and to appropriate and to apply any
and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to,
indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured,
but not including trust accounts, and in whatever currency denominated) and any
other indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender or that subsequent
holder to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower, whether or not
matured, against and on account of the Obligations of the Borrower to that
Lender or that subsequent holder under the Loan Documents, including, but not
limited to, all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected
with the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not (a) that Lender or that
subsequent holder shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) the principal of
or the interest on the Loans or Notes and other amounts due hereunder shall have
become due and payable pursuant to Section 9 and although said obligations and
liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured.

Section 12.17. Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents constitute the entire
understanding of the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof
and any prior agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are
superseded hereby.

Section 12.18. Governing Law. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and the rights and duties of the parties hereto, shall be construed and
determined in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois.

Section 12.19. Severability of Provisions. Any provision of any Loan
Document which is unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such


<PAGE>


unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise
thereof does not violate any applicable mandatory provisions of law, and all the
provisions of this Agreement and other Loan Documents are intended to be subject
to all applicable mandatory provisions of law which may be controlling and to be
limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents invalid or unenforceable.

Section 12.20. Excess Interest. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, no such provision shall
require the payment or permit the collection of any amount of interest in excess
of the maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable law to be charged for
the use or detention, or the forbearance in the collection, of all or any
portion of the Loans or other obligations outstanding under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document ("Excess Interest"). If any Excess Interest is provided
for, or is adjudicated to be provided for, herein or in any other Loan Document,
then in such event (a) the provisions of this Section shall govern and control,
(b) neither the Borrower nor any guarantor or endorser shall be obligated to pay
any Excess Interest, (c) any Excess Interest that the Administrative Agent or
any Lender may have received hereunder shall, at the option of the
Administrative Agent, be (i) applied as a credit against the then outstanding
principal amount of Obligations hereunder and accrued and unpaid interest
thereon (not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law), (ii)
refunded to the Borrower, or (iii) any combination of the foregoing, (d) the
interest rate payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
automatically subject to reduction to the maximum lawful contract rate allowed
under applicable usury laws (the "Maximum Rate"), and this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been, and shall be, reformed and
modified to reflect such reduction in the relevant interest rate, and (e)
neither the Borrower nor any guarantor or endorser shall have any action against
the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any damages whatsoever arising out of
the payment or collection of any Excess Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if for any period of time interest on any of Borrower's Obligations is
calculated at the Maximum Rate rather than the applicable rate under this
Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum
Rate, the rate of interest payable on the Borrower's Obligations shall remain at
the Maximum Rate until the Lenders have received the amount of interest which
such Lenders would have received during such period on the Borrower's
Obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the Maximum Rate during
such period.

Section 12.21. Construction. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or
construed to permit any act or omission which is prohibited by the terms of any
Collateral Document, the covenants and agreements contained herein being in
addition to and not in substitution for the covenants and agreements contained
in the Collateral Documents.

Section 12.22. Lender's Obligations Several. The obligations of the
Lenders hereunder are several and not joint. Nothing contained in this Agreement
and no action taken by the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute
the Lenders a partnership, association, joint venture or other entity.


<PAGE>


Section 12.23. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. The
Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and of any Illinois State
court sitting in the City of Chicago for purposes of all legal proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court
and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE

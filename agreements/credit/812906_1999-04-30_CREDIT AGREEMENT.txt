SECTION 2.02. Method of Borrowing Syndicated Loans. (a) The Borrower
shall give the Agent notice in the form attached hereto as Exhibit K (a "Notice
of Borrowing") prior to 11:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on or before the day
of each Base Rate Borrowing and at least 3 Euro-Dollar Business Days before each
Euro-Dollar Borrowing, specifying:

(i) the date of such Syndicated Borrowing, which shall be a
Domestic Business Day in the case of a Base Rate Borrowing or a
Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

(ii) the aggregate amount of such Syndicated Borrowing,

(iii) whether the Syndicated Loans comprising such Syndicated
Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, and

(iv) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the duration of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of
the definition of Interest Period.

A Notice of Borrowing may be submitted by the Borrower no more frequently than 3
times in each calendar week.

(b) Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly
notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's ratable share of
such Syndicated Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be
revocable by the Borrower.

(c) Not later than 1:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date of
each Syndicated Borrowing, each Bank shall (except as provided in subsection (d)
of this Section) make available its ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing,
in Federal or other funds immediately available in Atlanta, Georgia, to the
Agent at its address referred to in or specified pursuant to Section 9.01.
Unless the Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article
III has not been satisfied, the Agent will make the funds so received from the
Banks available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address. Unless the
Agent receives notice from a Bank, at the Agent's address referred to in Section
9.01, no later than 4:00 P.M. (local time at such address) on the Domestic
Business Day before the date of a Syndicated Borrowing stating that such Bank
will not make a Syndicated Loan in connection with such Syndicated Borrowing,
the Agent shall be entitled to assume that such Bank will make a Syndicated Loan
in connection with such Syndicated Borrowing and, in reliance on such
assumption, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) make available such
Bank's ratable share of such Syndicated Borrowing to the Borrower for the
account of such Bank. If the Agent makes such Bank's ratable share available to
the Borrower and such Bank does not in fact make its ratable share of such
Syndicated Borrowing available on such date, the Agent shall be entitled to
recover such Bank's ratable share from such Bank or the Borrower (and for such
purpose shall be entitled to charge such amount to any account of the Borrower
maintained with the Agent), together with interest thereon for each day during
the period from the date of such Syndicated Borrowing until such sum shall be
paid in full at a rate per annum equal to the rate at which the Agent determines
that it obtained (or could have obtained) overnight Federal funds to cover such
amount for each



16
<PAGE>   21

such day during such period, provided that any such payment by the Borrower of
such Bank's ratable share and interest thereon shall be without prejudice to any
rights that the Borrower may have against such Bank. If such Bank shall repay to
the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such
Bank's Syndicated Loan included in such Syndicated Borrowing for purposes of
this Agreement.

(d) If any Bank makes a new Syndicated Loan hereunder on a day on which
the Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Syndicated Loan from
such Bank, such Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Syndicated Loan to make
such repayment and only an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the
amount being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be made available by
such Bank to the Agent as provided in subsection (c) of this Section, or
remitted by the Borrower to the Agent as provided in Section 2.12, as the case
may be.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no Euro-Dollar Borrowing may be made if there shall have occurred a
Default or an Event of Default, which Default or Event of Default shall not have
been cured or waived in writing.

(f) In the event that a Notice of Borrowing fails to specify whether
the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to be Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar
Loans, such Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower is otherwise
entitled under this Agreement to repay any Loans maturing at the end of an
Interest Period applicable thereto with the proceeds of a new Borrowing, and the
Borrower fails to repay such Loans using its own moneys and fails to give a
Notice of Borrowing in connection with such new Borrowing, a new Borrowing shall
be deemed to be made on the date such Loans mature in an amount equal to the
principal amount of the Loans so maturing, and the Loans comprising such new
Borrowing shall be Base Rate Loans.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i)
there shall not be more than 8 different Interest Periods outstanding at the
same time (for which purpose Interest Periods described in different numbered
clauses of the definition of the term "Interest Period" shall be deemed to be
different Interest Periods even if they are coterminous) and (ii) the proceeds
of any Base Rate Borrowing shall be applied first to repay the unpaid principal
amount of all Base Rate Loans (if any) outstanding immediately before such Base
Rate Borrowing.

SECTION 2.03. Money Market Loans. (a) In addition to making Syndicated
Borrowings, the Borrower may, as set forth in this Section, request the Banks to
make offers to make Money Market Loans to the Borrower. The Banks may, but shall
have no obligation to, make such offers and the Borrower may, but shall have no
obligation to, accept any such offers in the manner set forth in this Section,
provided that:

(i) there may be no more than 8 different Interest Periods for
both Syndicated Loans and Money Market Loans outstanding at the same
time (for which purpose Interest Periods described in different
numbered clauses of the definition of the term "Interest Period" shall
be deemed to be different Interest Periods even if they are
coterminous); and



17
<PAGE>   22

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of all Money Market Loans,

at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of

(b) When the Borrower wishes to request offers to make Money Market
Loans, it shall give the Banks notice substantially in the form of Exhibit E

$1,000,000) but shall not cause the limits specified in Section 2.03(a)
to be violated; and

(iii) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
which shall be 7 to 180 days.

The Borrower may request offers to make Money Market Loans for up to
two different Interest Periods in a single Money Market Quote Request; provided

separate Money Market Quote Request for a separate Money Market Borrowing.
Except as otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower
shall not deliver a Money Market Quote Request more frequently than once in any
period of 5 consecutive Domestic Business Days.

(c) (i) Each Bank may, but shall have no obligation to, submit a Money
Market Quote containing an offer to make a Money Market Loan in response to any
Money Market Quote Request; provided that, if the Borrower's request under
Section 2.03(b) specified more than one Interest Period, such Bank may, but
shall have no obligation to, make a single submission containing a separate
offer for each such Interest Period and each such separate offer shall be deemed
to be a separate Money Market Quote. Each Money Market Quote must be submitted
to the Borrower not later than 10:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the
Quotation Date (or such other time and date as the Borrower and the Banks may
agree). Subject to Section 6.01, any Money Market Quote so made shall be
irrevocable except with the written consent of the Banks.

(ii) Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the
form of Exhibit F hereto and shall specify:

(A) the proposed date of the Money Market Borrowing
and the duration of the Interest Period therefor, which shall
be 7 to 180 days;



18

Loan which the quoting Bank is willing to make for the

$1,000,000, and (z) may not exceed the principal amount of the
Money Market Borrowing for which offers were requested;

(C) the rate of interest per annum (rounded, if
necessary, to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) (the "Money Market
Rate") offered for each such Money Market Loan; and

(D) the identity of the quoting Bank.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Banks and the Borrower, no Money Market Quote
shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or propose terms other
than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Money Market Quote
Request (other than setting forth the maximum principal amount of the Money
Market Loan which the quoting Bank is willing to make for the applicable
Interest Period).

(d) Not later than 11:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the Quotation
Date (or such other time and date as the Borrower and the Banks may agree), the
Borrower shall notify the Banks and the Agent of its acceptance or nonacceptance
of the offers so notified to it pursuant to Section 2.03(c). In the case of
acceptance, such notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers
for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Money
Market Quote in whole or in part (provided that any Money Market Quote accepted
in part from any Bank shall not be less than the amount set forth in the Money
Market Quote of such Bank as the minimum principal amount of the Money Market
Loan such Bank was willing to make for the applicable Interest Period); provided
that:

(i) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market
Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related
Money Market Quote Request;

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market
Borrowing shall be at least $5,000,000 (and in larger multiples of
$1,000,000) but shall not cause the limits specified in Section 2.03(a)
to be violated;

(iii) acceptance of offers may only be made in ascending order
of Money Market Rates; and



19
<PAGE>   24

(iv) the Borrower may not accept any offer that fails to
comply with Section 2.03(c)(ii) or otherwise fails to comply with the
requirements of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section
2.03(a)).

If offers are made by two or more Banks with the same Money Market Rates for a
greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which offers
are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount of Money
Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be allocated by
the Borrower among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of $100,000)
in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers. Determinations
by the Borrower of the amounts of Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

(f) Any Bank whose offer to make any Money Market Loan has been
accepted shall, not later than 1:00 P.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the
Quotation Date, make the amount of such Loan available to the Borrower on such
date by depositing the same, in immediately available funds, in an account of
the Borrower as directed by the Borrower. The Borrower shall notify the Agent by
3:00 p.m. (Atlanta, Georgia time) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit L.

evidenced by a single Money Market Note payable to the order of such Bank for
the account of its Lending Office.

(c) Upon receipt of each Bank's Notes pursuant to Section 3.01, the
Agent shall deliver such Notes to such Bank. Each Bank shall record, and prior
to any transfer of its Notes shall endorse on the schedule forming a part
thereof appropriate notations to evidence, the date, amount and maturity of, and
effective interest rate for, each Loan made by it, the date and amount of each
payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto and whether, in
the case of such Bank's Syndicated Note, such Syndicated Loan is a Base Rate
Loan or Euro-Dollar Loan, and such schedule shall constitute rebuttable
presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing and unpaid on such Bank's
Notes; provided that the failure of any Bank to make, or any error in making,
any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligation of the
Borrower hereunder or under the Notes or the ability of any Bank to assign its
Notes. Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to endorse
its Notes and to attach to and make a part of any Note a continuation of any
such schedule as and when required.

SECTION 2.05. Maturity of Loans. (a) Each Loan included in any

(b) The Borrower shall have the right, on the First Anniversary Date
and the Second Anniversary Date, to request an extension of the Termination Date
for a period of one year each, on the terms and conditions set forth in this
paragraph. Upon written request of the



20
<PAGE>   25

Borrower, which shall be made in writing and delivered to the Agent on a
Domestic Business Day no fewer than 60 days prior to the applicable Anniversary
Date, the Banks and the Agent in their sole and absolute discretion may (but
shall not be obligated to) extend the then effective Termination Date for a
period of one year. The terms of any extension of the Termination Date shall be
independently negotiated among the Borrower, the Banks and the Agent at the time
of the extension request, provided that the terms of the extension may be the
same as those in effect prior to any extension should the Borrower, the Banks
and the Agent so agree; provided, further, that should the terms of the
extension be other than those in effect prior to the extension, then the Loan
Documents shall be amended to the extent necessary to incorporate any such
different terms. In the event that a Bank chooses to extend the Termination Date
for such a one year period, notice shall be given by such Bank to the Borrower
and the Agent not more than 30, nor fewer than 15, days prior to the applicable
Anniversary Date; provided that the Termination Date shall not be extended with
respect to any of the Banks (regardless of whether any relevant Bank has
delivered a favorable extension notice) unless the Required Banks have delivered
favorable extension notices and are willing to extend the Termination Date and
either (i) the remaining Banks shall on the Termination Date applicable to the
Commitment of each Bank that has not elected to extend the Termination Date (a
"Terminating Bank") purchase ratable assignments (without any obligations so to
do) from each Terminating Bank (in the form of an Assignment and Acceptance) in
accordance with their respective percentage of the remaining aggregate amount of
the Commitments; provided that such remaining Banks shall be provided such
opportunity (which opportunity shall allow such Banks at least 5 Domestic
Business Days in which to make a decision) prior to the Borrower finding another
bank pursuant to the immediately succeeding clause (ii); and provided, further,
that should any of the remaining Banks elect not to purchase such an assignment,
then such other remaining Banks shall be entitled to purchase an assignment on
the Termination Date applicable to the Commitment of each Terminating Bank from
such Terminating Bank which includes the ratable interest that was otherwise
available to such non-purchasing remaining Bank or Banks, as the case may be;
(ii) the Borrower shall find another bank, acceptable to the Agent, willing to
accept an assignment on the Termination Date applicable to the Commitment of
each Terminating Bank from such Terminating Bank (in the form of an Assignment
and Acceptance); or (iii) the Borrower shall reduce the aggregate Commitments on
the Termination Date applicable to the Commitment of each Terminating Bank in an
amount equal to the sum of the Commitments of all such Terminating Banks.

SECTION 2.06. Interest Rates. (a) "Applicable Margin" shall be
determined quarterly based upon the ratio of Income Available for Fixed Charges
to Consolidated Fixed Charges (calculated as of the last day of each Fiscal
Quarter for the period of 4 consecutive Fiscal Quarters year ended), as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Ratio of Income Available for
Fixed Charges to
Consolidated Fixed Charges                  Base Rate Loans             Euro-Dollar Loans

Equal to or greater than 1.80                      0%                         .60%

Equal to or greater than 1.65

Equal to or greater than 1.50
But less than 1.65                                 0%                        1.00%

Less than 1.50                                     0%                        1.20%
</TABLE>




21
<PAGE>   26

The Applicable Margin shall be determined effective as of the date (herein, the
"Rate Determination Date") which is 45 days after the last day of the Fiscal
Quarter as of the end of which the foregoing ratio is being determined, based on
the quarterly financial statements for such Fiscal Quarter, and the Applicable
Margin so determined shall remain effective from such Rate Determination Date
until the date which is 45 days after the last day of the Fiscal Quarter in
which such Rate Determination Date falls (which latter date shall be a new Rate
Determination Date); provided that (i) for the period from and including the
Closing Date to but excluding the Rate Determination Date next following the
Closing Date, the Applicable Margin shall be (A) 0% for Base Rate Loans, and (B)
1.00% for Euro-Dollar Loans, (ii) in the case of any Applicable Margin
determined for the fourth and final Fiscal Quarter of a Fiscal Year, the Rate
Determination Date shall be the date which is 90 days after the last day of such
final Fiscal Quarter and such Applicable Margin shall be determined based upon
the annual audited financial statements for the Fiscal Year ended on the last
day of such final Fiscal Quarter, and (iii) if on any Rate Determination Date
the Borrower shall have failed to deliver to the Banks the financial statements
required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or Section 5.01(b) with
respect to the Fiscal Year or Fiscal Quarter, as the case may be, most recently
ended prior to such Rate Determination Date, then for the period beginning on
such Rate Determination Date and ending on the earlier of (A) the date on which
the Borrower shall deliver to the Banks the financial statements to be delivered
pursuant to Section 5.01(b) with respect to such Fiscal Quarter or any
subsequent Fiscal Quarter, or (B) the date on which the Borrower shall deliver
to the Banks annual financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 5.01(a) with respect to the Fiscal Year which includes such Fiscal
Quarter or any subsequent Fiscal Year, the Applicable Margin shall be determined
as if the ratio of Income Available for Fixed Charges to Consolidated Fixed
Charges was less than 1.50 at all times during such period. Any change in the
Applicable Margin on any Rate Determination Date shall result in a corresponding
change, effective on and as of such Rate Determination Date, in the interest
rate applicable to each Syndicated Loan outstanding on such Rate Determination
Date; provided, that: (i) for Euro-Dollar Loans, changes in Applicable Margin
shall only be effective for Interest Periods commencing on or after such Rate
Determination Date; and (ii) no Applicable Margin shall be decreased pursuant to
this Section 2.06 if a Default is in existence on such Rate Determination Date.

(b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan is made until it
becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate for such day plus the
Applicable Margin. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on
the last day thereof. Any overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, overdue interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest,
payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the
Default Rate.


22
<PAGE>   27

(c) Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the applicable Adjusted
London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period; provided that if any
Euro-Dollar Loan shall, as a result of clause (1)(c) of the definition of
Interest Period, have an Interest Period of less than one month, such
Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest during such Interest Period at the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans during such period. Such interest shall be payable
for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is
longer than 3 months, at intervals of 3 months after the first day thereof. Any
overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, overdue
interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for
each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.

The "Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest
Period means a rate per annum equal to the quotient obtained (rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100th of 1%) by dividing (i) the applicable
London Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period by (ii) 1.00 minus the
Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Euro-Dollar Loan
means for the Interest Period of such Euro-Dollar Loan the rate per annum
determined on the basis of the rate for deposits in Dollars of amounts equal or
comparable to the principal amount of such Euro-Dollar Loan offered for a term
comparable to such Interest Period, which rate appears on the display designated
as Page "3750" of the Telerate Service (or such other page as may replace page
3750 of that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by
the British Banker's Association for the purpose of displaying London Interbank
Offered Rates for U.S. dollar deposits) determined as of 1:00 p.m. New York City
time, 2 Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to the first day of such Interest
Period.

"Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage
(expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
determining the maximum reserve requirement for a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System in respect of "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or in respect of any
other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the
interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions
of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of
any Bank to United States residents). The Adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate
shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in
the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage.

(d) Each Money Market Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate
per annum equal to the Money Market Rate for such Loan quoted by the Bank making
such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03. Such interest shall be payable for
such Interest Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is
longer than 90 days, at intervals of 90 days after the first day thereof. Any
overdue principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest on
any Money Market Loan shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until
paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.



23
<PAGE>   28

(e) The Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the
Loans hereunder. The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the
Banks by telecopy of each rate of interest so determined, and its determination
thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(f) After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default, the
principal amount of the Loans (and, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
all accrued interest thereon) shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

SECTION 2.07. Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
ratable account of each Bank a facility fee equal to the product of: (i) the
aggregate of the daily average amounts of such Bank's Commitment, times (ii) a
per annum percentage equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate. Such facility
fee shall accrue from and including the Closing Date to and including the
Termination Date. Facility fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the
first Facility Fee Payment Date following each Facility Fee Determination Date
and on the Termination Date; provided that should the Commitments be terminated
at any time prior to the Termination Date for any reason, the entire accrued and
unpaid facility fee shall be paid on the date of such termination. The
"Applicable Facility Fee Rate" shall be determined quarterly based upon the
ratio of Income Available for Fixed Charges to Consolidated Fixed Charges
(calculated as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter for the period of 4
consecutive Fiscal Quarters then ended) as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Ratio of Income Available for Fixed Charges

Equal to or greater than 1.80                                                   .15%

Equal to or greater than 1.65
But less than 1.80                                                              .20%

Equal to or greater than 1.50
But less than 1.65                                                              .25%

Less than 1.50                                                                  .30%
</TABLE>

The Applicable Facility Fee Rate shall be determined effective as of the date
(herein, the "Facility Fee Determination Date") which is 45 days after the last
day of the Fiscal Quarter as of the end of which the foregoing ratio is being
determined, based on the quarterly financial statements for such Fiscal Quarter,
and the Applicable Facility Fee Rate so determined shall remain effective from
such Facility Fee Determination Date until the date which is 45 days after the
last day of the Fiscal Quarter in which such Facility Fee Determination Date
falls (which latter date shall be a new Facility Fee Determination Date);
provided that (i) for the period from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the Facility Fee Determination Date next following the Closing Date,
the Applicable Facility Fee Rate shall be .25%; (ii) in the case of any




24
<PAGE>   29

Applicable Facility Fee Rate determined for the fourth and final Fiscal Quarter
of a Fiscal Year, the Facility Fee Determination Date shall be the date which is
90 days after the last day of such final Fiscal Quarter and such Applicable
Facility Fee Rate shall be determined based upon the annual audited financial
statements for the Fiscal Year ended on the last day of such final Fiscal
Quarter, and (iii) if on any Facility Fee Determination Date the Borrower shall
have failed to deliver to the Banks the financial statements required to be
delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or Section 5.01(b) with respect to the
Fiscal Year or Fiscal Quarter, as the case may be, most recently ended prior to
such Facility Fee Determination Date, then for the period beginning on such
Facility Fee Determination Date and ending on the earlier of (A) the date on
which the Borrower shall deliver to the Banks the financial statements to be
delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(b) with respect to such Fiscal Quarter or any
subsequent Fiscal Quarter, and (B) the date on which the Borrower shall deliver
to the Banks annual financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 5.01(a) with respect to the Fiscal Year which includes such Fiscal
Quarter or any subsequent Fiscal Year, the Applicable Facility Fee Rate shall be
determined as if the ratio of Income Available for Fixed Charges to Consolidated
Fixed Charges was less than 1.50 at all times during such period; provided that
the Applicable Facility Fee Rate shall not be decreased on any Facility Fee
Determination Date pursuant to this Section 2.07 if a Default is in existence on
such Facility Fee Determination Date.

(b) The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the account and sole
benefit of the Agent, such fees and other amounts at such times as set forth in
the Agent's Letter Agreement.

SECTION 2.08. Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. The
Borrower may, upon at least 3 Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent,
terminate at any time, or proportionately reduce from time to time by an
aggregate amount of at least $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000,
the Commitments; provided, however, no such termination or reduction shall be in
an amount greater than the Total Unused Commitments on the date of such
termination or reduction. If the Commitments are terminated in their entirety,
all accrued fees (as provided under Section 2.07) shall be payable on the
effective date of such termination.

SECTION 2.09. Mandatory Termination of Commitments. The Commitments
shall terminate on the Termination Date and any Loans then outstanding (together
with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.

SECTION 2.10. Optional Prepayments. (a) The Borrower may, upon at least
1 Domestic Business Day's notice to the Agent, prepay any Base Rate Borrowing in
whole at any time, or from time to time in part in amounts aggregating at least
$5,000,000, or any larger multiple of $1,000,000, by paying the principal amount
to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment.
Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the Base Rate
Loans of the several Banks included in such Base Rate Borrowing.

(b) Except as provided in Section 8.02, the Borrower may not prepay all
or any portion of the principal amount of any Euro-Dollar Loan or any Money
Market Loan prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto.



25
<PAGE>   30

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this
Section, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and
of such Bank's ratable share of such prepayment and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.11. Mandatory Prepayments. On each date on which the
Commitments are reduced or terminated pursuant to Section 2.08 or Section 2.09,
the Borrower shall repay or prepay such principal amount of the outstanding
Loans, if any (together with interest accrued thereon and any amounts due under
Section 8.05(a)), as may be necessary so that after such payment the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Loans does not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Commitments as then reduced or terminated. Each such payment or prepayment shall
be applied to repay or prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks; provided
that such prepayment shall be applied, first, to Syndicated Loans outstanding on
the date of such prepayment (in direct order of maturity) and then, to the
extent necessary, to Money Market Loans outstanding on the date of such
prepayment (in direct order of maturity).

SECTION 2.12. General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall
make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of facility
fees hereunder, not later than 11:00 A.M. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the date
when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available in Atlanta, Georgia,
to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 9.01. The Agent will promptly
distribute to each Bank its ratable share of each such payment received by the
Agent for the account of the Banks.

(b) Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate
Loans or the Money Market Loans or of fees shall be due on a day which is not a
Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Domestic Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a
Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day
falls in another calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof
shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day. If the date for any
payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest
thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

(c) All payments of principal, interest and fees and all other amounts
to be made by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any Loan
or fee relating thereto shall be paid without deduction for, and free from, any
tax, imposts, levies, duties, deductions, or withholdings of any nature now or
at anytime hereafter imposed by any governmental authority or by any taxing
authority thereof or therein excluding in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed
on or measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank is organized or any political
subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income,
and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Bank's applicable
Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded
taxes, imposts, levies, duties, deductions or withholdings of any nature being
"Taxes"). In the event that the Borrower is required by applicable law to make
any such withholding or deduction of Taxes with respect to any Loan or fee or
other amount, the



26
<PAGE>   31

Borrower shall pay such deduction or withholding to the applicable taxing
authority, shall promptly furnish to any Bank in respect of which such deduction
or withholding is made all receipts and other documents evidencing such payment
and shall pay to such Bank additional amounts as may be necessary in order that
the amount received by such Bank after the required withholding or other payment
shall equal the amount such Bank would have received had no such withholding or
other payment been made. If no withholding or deduction of Taxes are payable in
respect of any Loan or fee relating thereto, the Borrower shall furnish any
Bank, at such Bank's request, a certificate from each applicable taxing
authority or an opinion of counsel acceptable to such Bank, in either case
stating that such payments are exempt from or not subject to withholding or
deduction of Taxes. If the Borrower fails to provide such original or certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment of Taxes or certificate(s) or opinion of
counsel of exemption, the Borrower hereby agrees to compensate such Bank for,
and indemnify them with respect to, the tax consequences of the Borrower's
failure to provide evidence of tax payments or tax exemption.

In the event any Bank receives a refund of any Taxes paid by
the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.12, it will pay to the Borrower the
amount of such refund promptly upon receipt thereof; provided, however, if at
any time thereafter it is required to return such refund, the Borrower shall
promptly repay to it the amount of such refund.

Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained
in this Section 2.12 shall be applicable with respect to any Participant,
Assignee or other Transferee, and any calculations required by such provisions
(i) shall be made based upon the circumstances of such Participant, Assignee or
other Transferee, and (ii) constitute a continuing agreement and shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the payment in full or cancellation of the
Notes.

SECTION 2.13. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest on
Base Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day). Interest on Euro-Dollar Loans and interest on Money Market Loans
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and paid for the actual
number of days elapsed, calculated as to each Interest Period from and including
the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof. Facility fees and
any other fees payable hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

thereupon terminate, and (ii) if requested by the Required Banks, by notice to
the Borrower declare the Notes (together with accrued interest thereon) and all
other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to be, and
the Notes (together with all accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts
payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall thereupon become,
immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; provided that if
any Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) above occurs with respect to
the Borrower, without any notice to the Borrower or any other act by the Agent
or the Banks, the Commitments shall thereupon automatically terminate and the
Notes (together with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts payable
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall automatically become
immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Agent shall have available to it all other remedies at law or
equity, and shall exercise any one or all of them at the request of the Required
Banks.

SECTION 6.02. Notice of Default. The Agent shall give notice
to the Borrower of any Default under Section 6.01(c) promptly upon being
requested to do so by any Bank and shall thereupon notify all the Banks thereof.

ARTICLE VII

THE AGENT

SECTION 7.01. Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Bank
hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as its agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents with such powers as are
specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together
with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent: (a)
shall have no duties or responsibilities except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall not by reason of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document be a trustee for any Bank; (b) shall not be
responsible to the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or in any




41
<PAGE>   46

certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any
Bank under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or any other document referred to or provided for herein
or therein or for any failure by the Borrower to perform any of its obligations
hereunder or thereunder; (c) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any
litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or under any other Loan Document
except to the extent requested by the Required Banks, and then only on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Agent, and (d) shall not be responsible for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein
or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent may employ agents and
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. The
provisions of this Article VII are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the
Banks, and the Borrower shall not have any rights as a third party beneficiary
of any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under
this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall act solely as
agent of the Banks and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed
any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with or for the
Borrower. The duties of the Agent shall be ministerial and administrative in
nature, and the Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Bank.

SECTION 7.02. Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication (including any
thereof by telephone, telefax, telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person
or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
accountants or other experts selected by the Agent. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
hereunder and thereunder in accordance with instructions signed by the Required
Banks, and such instructions of the Required Banks in any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks.

SECTION 7.03. Defaults. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default (other than the
non-payment of principal of or interest on the Loans) unless the Agent has
received notice from a Bank or the Borrower specifying such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default". In the event that
the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. The Agent
shall give each Bank prompt notice of each non-payment of principal of or
interest on the Loans, whether or not it has received any notice of the
occurrence of such non-payment. The Agent shall (subject to Section 9.05) take
such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
directed by the Required Banks, provided that, unless and until the Agent shall
have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of
the Banks.

SECTION 7.04. Rights of Agent and its Affiliates as a Bank.
With respect to any Loan made by Wachovia or an Affiliate of Wachovia, such
Affiliate and Wachovia in their capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as
though it were not an Affiliate of Wachovia (or in Wachovia's case, acting as
the Agent), and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise
indicates, include such Affiliate of Wachovia or Wachovia in its individual
capacity. Such Affiliate and Wachovia may (without having to account therefor to
any Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind
of banking, trust or other business with the Borrower (and any of its
Affiliates) as if they were not an Affiliate of the Agent or the Agent,
respectively; and such Affiliate and Wachovia may accept fees and other
consideration from the Borrower (in addition to any agency fees and arrangement
fees heretofore agreed to between the Borrower and Wachovia) for services in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise without
having to account for the same to the Banks.

SECTION 7.05. Indemnification. Each Bank severally agrees to
indemnify the Agent, to the extent the Agent shall not have been reimbursed by
the Borrower, ratably in accordance with its Commitment, for any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees and disbursements)
or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other documents contemplated
by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (excluding, unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of its
agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
thereof or any such other documents; provided, however, that no Bank shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent. If any indemnity furnished to the
Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the Agent, be insufficient or
become impaired, the Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not
commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is
furnished.

SECTION 7.06. CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. THE AGENT SHALL NOT BE
RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO ANY BANK, THE BORROWER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY
FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE ALLEGED AS A
RESULT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

SECTION 7.07. Payee of Note Treated as Owner. The Agent may
deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes
hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Agent and the provisions of Section 9.07(c) have
been satisfied. Any requests, authority or consent of any Person who at the time
of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the holder of any
Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or
assignee of that Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor or
replacement thereof.



43
<PAGE>   48

SECTION 7.08. Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank
agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the Agent or any other
Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis of the Borrower and decision to enter into this
Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents. The Agent shall not be required to keep itself (or any Bank) informed
as to the performance or observance by the Borrower of this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for
herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Borrower or any
other Person. Except for notices, reports and other documents and information
expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent hereunder or under
the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of the Borrower or any other Person (or any of
their Affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Agent.

SECTION 7.09. Failure to Act. Except for action expressly
required of the Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, the Agent
shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder
and thereunder unless it shall receive further assurances to its satisfaction by
the Banks of their indemnification obligations under Section 7.05 against any
and all liability and expense which may be incurred by the Agent by reason of
taking, continuing to take, or failing to take any such action.

SECTION 7.10. Resignation or Removal of Agent. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent may
resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower and
the Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required
Banks. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall have the
right to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within
30 days after the retiring Agent's notice of resignation or the Required Banks'
removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the
Banks, appoint a successor Agent. Any successor Agent shall be a bank which has
a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article VII
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder.

ARTICLE VIII

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES; COMPENSATION

SECTION 8.01. Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate
or Unfair. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period:

(a) the Agent determines that deposits in Dollars (in the
applicable amounts) are not being offered in the relevant market for such
Interest Period, or

(b) the Required Banks advise the Agent that the London
Interbank Offered Rate as determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Banks of funding Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest
Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make
the Euro-Dollar Loans specified in such notice shall be suspended. Unless the
Borrower notifies the Agent at least 2 Domestic Business Days before the date of
any Borrowing of Euro-Dollar Loans for which a Notice of Borrowing has
previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, such Borrowing
shall instead be made as a Base Rate Borrowing.

SECTION 8.02. Illegality. If, after the date hereof, the
adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any
existing or future law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (any
such authority, bank or agency being referred to as an "Authority" and any such
event being referred to as a "Change of Law"), or compliance by any Bank (or its
Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force
of law) of any Authority shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Bank (or
its Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans and such
Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to
the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such Bank notifies the
Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans shall be
suspended. Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section, such
Bank shall designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid
the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Bank, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank shall determine that it may
not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of its outstanding Euro-Dollar
Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such notice, the Borrower shall
immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal amount of each
Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank, together with accrued interest thereon and any
amount due such Bank pursuant to Section 8.05(a). Concurrently with prepaying
each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an
equal principal amount from such Bank (on which interest and principal shall be
payable contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other
Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate Loan.



45
<PAGE>   50

SECTION 8.03. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If after
the date hereof, a Change of Law or compliance by any Bank (or its Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any Authority:

(i) shall subject any Bank (or its Lending Office) to
any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Euro-Dollar
Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans,
or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank
(or its Lending Office) of the principal of or interest on its
Euro-Dollar Loans or any other amounts due under this
Agreement in respect of its Euro-Dollar Loans or its
obligation to make Euro-Dollar Loans (except for changes in
the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Bank or its
Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such
Bank's principal executive office or Lending Office is
located); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including,
without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with
respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any such requirement included
in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage) against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, any Bank (or its Lending Office); or

(iii) shall impose on any Bank (or its Lending
Office) or the London interbank market any other condition
affecting its Euro-Dollar Loans, its Notes or its obligation
to make Euro-Dollar Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Bank (or
its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euro-Dollar Loan, or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or its Lending
Office) under this Agreement or under its Notes with respect thereto, by an
amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within 15 days after demand by
such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased
cost or reduction.

(b) If any Bank shall have determined that after the date
hereof the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital
adequacy, or any change in any existing or future law, rule or regulation, or
any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Bank (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any Authority, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank
could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Bank's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15
days after demand by such Bank, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.



46
<PAGE>   51

(c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent
of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which
will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will
designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of
such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank
claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount
or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

(d) The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall be applicable
with respect to any Participant, Assignee or other Transferee, and any
calculations required by such provisions shall be made based upon the
circumstances of such Participant, Assignee or other Transferee.

SECTION 8.04. Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected
Euro-Dollar Loans. If (i)the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain
Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank
has demanded compensation under Section 8.03, and the Borrower shall, by at
least 5 Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to such Bank through the Agent,
have elected that the provisions of this Section shall apply to such Bank, then,
unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension or demand for compensation no longer apply:

(a) all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as
Euro-Dollar Loans shall be made instead as Base Rate Loans (in such case
interest and principal on such Loans shall be payable contemporaneously with the
related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and

(b) after each of its Euro-Dollar Loans has been repaid, all
payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to repay such Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be applied to repay its Base Rate Loans instead.

In the event that the Borrower shall elect that the provisions of this Section
shall apply to any Bank, the Borrower shall remain liable for, and shall pay to
such Bank as provided herein, all amounts due such Bank under Section 8.03 in
respect of the period preceding the date of conversion of such Bank's Loans
resulting from the Borrower's election.

SECTION 8.05. Compensation. Upon the request of any Bank,
delivered to the Borrower and the Agent, the Borrower shall pay to such Bank
such amount or amounts as shall compensate such Bank for any loss, cost or
expense incurred by such Bank as a result of:

(a) any payment or prepayment (pursuant to Section 2.09,
Section 2.10, Section 8.02 or otherwise) of a Euro-Dollar Loan or a Money Market
Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such
Euro-Dollar Loan or Money Market Loan, as the case may be;



47
<PAGE>   52

(b) any failure by the Borrower to prepay a Euro-Dollar Loan
or a Money Market Loan on the date for such prepayment specified in the relevant
notice of prepayment hereunder;

(c) any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Euro-Dollar Loan
on the date for the Euro-Dollar Borrowing of which such Euro-Dollar Loan is a
part specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing delivered pursuant to
Section 2.02; or

(d) any failure by the Borrower to borrow a Money Market Loan
(with respect to which the Borrower has accepted a Money Market Quote) on the
date for the Money Market Borrowing of which such Money Market Loan is a part
specified in the applicable Money Market Quote Request delivered pursuant to
Section 2.03;

such compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (x) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so
paid or prepaid or not prepaid or borrowed for the period from the date of such
payment, prepayment or failure to prepay or borrow to the last day of the then
current Interest Period for such Euro-Dollar Loan (or, in the case of a failure
to prepay or borrow, the Interest Period for such Euro-Dollar Loan which would
have commenced on the date of such failure to prepay or borrow) at the
applicable rate of interest for such Euro-Dollar Loan provided for herein over
(y) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Bank) such Bank
would have paid on deposits in Dollars of comparable amounts having terms
comparable to such period placed with it by leading banks in the London
interbank market (if such Loan is a Euro-Dollar Loan).

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 9.01. Notices. All notices, requests and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including facsimile
transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party at its address
or telecopy number set forth on the signature pages hereof or such other address
or telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice
to each other party. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be
effective (i) if given by telecopier, when such telecopy is transmitted to the
telecopy number specified in this Section and the telecopy machine used by the
sender provides a written confirmation that such telecopy has been so
transmitted or receipt of such telecopy transmission is otherwise confirmed,
(ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the
mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, and (iii) if
given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this
Section; provided that notices to the Agent under Article II or Article VIII
shall not be effective until received.

SECTION 9.02. No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Agent or
any Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any Note
or other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights



48
<PAGE>   53

and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law.

SECTION 9.03. Expenses; Documentary Taxes; Indemnification.
(a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent,
including fees and disbursements of special counsel for the Agent, in connection
with the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any waiver
or consent hereunder or thereunder or any amendment hereof or thereof or any
Default or alleged Default hereunder or thereunder and (ii) if a Default occurs,
all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent or any Bank, including fees and
disbursements of counsel, in connection with such Default and collection and
other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom, including out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in enforcing this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each Bank
against any transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by
any Authority by reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents.

(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent, the Banks and each
Affiliate thereof and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities,
claims or damages to which any of them may become subject, insofar as such
losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise out of or result from any actual or
proposed use by the Borrower of the proceeds of any extension of credit by any
Bank hereunder or breach by the Borrower of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or from investigation, litigation (including, without limitation, any
actions taken by the Agent or any of the Banks to enforce this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents) or other proceeding (including, without limitation,
any threatened investigation or proceeding) relating to the foregoing, and the
Borrower shall reimburse the Agent and each Bank, and each Affiliate thereof and
their respective directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand for any
expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees) incurred in connection with
any such investigation or proceeding; but excluding any such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by reason of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified.

SECTION 9.04. Setoffs; Sharing of Set-Offs. (a) The Borrower
hereby grants to each Bank, as security for the full and punctual payment and
performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, a
continuing lien on and security interest in all deposits and other sums credited
by or due from such Bank to the Borrower or subject to withdrawal by the
Borrower; and regardless of the adequacy of any collateral or other means of
obtaining repayment of such obligations, each Bank may at any time upon or after
the occurrence of any Event of Default, and without notice to the Borrower, set
off the whole or any portion or portions of any or all such deposits and other
sums against such obligations, whether or not any other Person or Persons could
also withdraw money therefrom.

(b) Each Bank agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right
of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the
aggregate amount of principal and interest owing with respect to the Syndicated
Notes held by it which is greater than the



49
<PAGE>   54

proportion received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of all
principal and interest owing with respect to the Syndicated Notes held by such
other Bank, the Bank receiving such proportionately greater payment shall
purchase such participations in the Syndicated Notes held by the other Banks
owing to such other Banks, and/or such other adjustments shall be made, as may
be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to
the Syndicated Notes held by the Banks owing to such other Banks shall be shared
by the Banks pro rata; provided that (i) nothing in this Section shall impair
the right of any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may
have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of
indebtedness (including, without limitation, Money Market Loans) of the Borrower
other than its indebtedness under the Syndicated Notes, and (ii) if all or any
portion of such payment received by the purchasing Bank is thereafter recovered
from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each other Bank shall be rescinded
and such other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price of
such participation to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal
to such other Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (x) the
amount of such other Bank's required repayment to (y) the total amount so
recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The
Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable
law, that any holder of a participation in a Syndicated Note, whether or not
acquired pursuant to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off
or counterclaim and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as
if such holder of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the
amount of such participation.

SECTION 9.05. Amendments and Waivers. (a) Any provision of
this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents may be amended or waived
if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the
Borrower and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are
affected thereby, by the Agent); provided that no such amendment or waiver
shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) change the Commitment of any Bank or
subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) change the principal of or
reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or reduce any fees hereunder, (iii)
change the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or
any fees hereunder, (iv) change the amount of principal or reduce the amount of
interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment thereof, (v) change the
percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the
Notes, or the percentage of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any
of them to take any action under this Section or any other provision of this
Agreement, (vi) change the manner of application of any payments made under this
Agreement or the Notes, (vii) release or substitute all or any substantial part
of the collateral (if any) held as security for the Loans, or (viii) release any
guaranty given to support payment of the Loans.

(b) The Borrower will not solicit, request or negotiate for or
with respect to any proposed waiver or amendment of any of the provisions of
this Agreement unless each Bank shall be informed thereof by the Borrower and
shall be afforded an opportunity of considering the same and shall be supplied
by the Borrower with sufficient information to enable it to make an informed
decision with respect thereto. Executed or true and correct copies of any waiver
or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall be
delivered by the Borrower to each Bank forthwith following the date on which the
same shall have been executed and



50
<PAGE>   55
delivered by the requisite percentage of Banks. The Borrower will not, directly
or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of
supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, to any Bank (in its
capacity as such) as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into
by such Bank of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, on the same terms,
ratably to all such Banks.

SECTION 9.06. Margin Stock Collateral. Each of the Banks
represents to the Agent and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is
not, directly or indirectly (by negative pledge or otherwise), relying upon any
Margin Stock as collateral in the extension or maintenance of the credit
provided for in this Agreement.

SECTION 9.07. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided that the Borrower
may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under this Agreement.

(b) Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more Persons (each
a "Participant") participating interests in any Loan owing to such Bank, any
Note held by such Bank, any Commitment hereunder or any other interest of such
Bank hereunder. In the event of any such sale by a Bank of a participating
interest to a Participant, such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, such Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance
thereof, such Bank shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes
under this Agreement, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. In no event shall a Bank that sells a
participation be obligated to the Participant to take or refrain from taking any
action hereunder except that such Bank may agree that it will not (except as
provided below), without the consent of the Participant, agree to (i)the change
of any date fixed for the payment of principal of or interest on the related
Loan or Loans, (ii) the change of the amount of any principal or reduce the
amount of any interest or fees due on any date fixed for the payment thereof
with respect to the related Loan or Loans, (iii) the change of the principal of
the related Loan or Loans, (iv) any reduction in the rate at which either
interest is payable thereon or (if the Participant is entitled to any part
thereof) commitment fee is payable hereunder from the rate at which the
Participant is entitled to receive interest or commitment fee (as the case may
be) in respect of such participation, (v) the release or substitution of all or
any substantial part of the collateral (if any) held as security for the Loans,
or (vi) the release of any guaranty given to support payment of the Loans. Each
Bank selling a participating interest in any Loan, Note, Commitment or other
interest under this Agreement shall, within 10 Domestic Business Days of such
sale, provide the Borrower and the Agent with written notification stating that
such sale has occurred and identifying the Participant and the interest
purchased by such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall
be entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participation in
Loans outstanding from time to time.

(c) Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or
financial institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part of all,
of its rights and obligations



51
<PAGE>   56

under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and such Assignee
shall assume all such rights and obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and
Acceptance in the form attached hereto as Exhibit J, executed by such Assignee,
such transferor Bank and the Agent (and, in the case of: (i) an Assignee that is
not then a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank; and (ii) an assignment not made
during the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, by the Borrower);
provided that (i) no interest may be sold by a Bank pursuant to this paragraph
(c) unless the Assignee shall agree to assume ratably equivalent portions of the
transferor Bank's Commitment, (ii) if the Assignee is not then a Bank, the
amount of the Commitment of the assigning Bank being assigned pursuant to such
assignment (determined as of the effective date of the assignment) shall be
equal to or more than $5,000,000, (iii) no interest may be sold by a Bank
pursuant to this paragraph (c) to any Assignee that is not then a Bank or an
Affiliate of a Bank without the consent of the Borrower, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, provided that the Borrower's consent shall not be
necessary with respect to any assignment made during the existence of a Default
or an Event of Default; and (iv) no interest may be sold by a Bank pursuant to
this paragraph (c) to any Assignee that is not then a Bank or an Affiliate of a
Bank, without the consent of the Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, provided, that although the Agent's consent may not be necessary with
respect to an Assignee that is then a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank, no such
assignment shall be effective until the conditions set forth in the following
sentence are satisfied. Upon (A) execution of the Assignment and Acceptance by
such transferor Bank, such Assignee, the Agent and (if applicable) the Borrower,
(B) delivery of an executed copy of the Assignment and Acceptance to the
Borrower and the Agent, (C) payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of
an amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and
such Assignee, and (D) payment by the assigning Bank to the Agent of a
processing and recordation fee of $1,500 (if such Assignee is then a Bank or an
Affiliate of a Bank) or $3,500 (if such Assignee is not then a Bank or an
Affiliate of a Bank), such Assignee shall for all purposes be a Bank party to
this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Bank under
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the rights of a Bank under
Section 2.03) to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto with a
Commitment as set forth in such instrument of assumption, and the transferor
Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent,
and no further consent or action by the Borrower, the Banks or the Agent shall
be required. Upon the consummation of any transfer to an Assignee pursuant to
this paragraph (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Borrower shall make
appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued to each of
such Assignee and such transferor Bank.

(d) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.08, the Borrower
authorizes each Bank to disclose to any Participant, Assignee or other
transferee (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all
financial and other information in such Bank's possession concerning the
Borrower which has been delivered to such Bank by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or which has been delivered to such Bank by the Borrower in connection
with such Bank's credit evaluation prior to entering into this Agreement.

(e) No Transferee shall be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 8.03 than the transferor Bank would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer is made
with the Borrower's prior written consent or by



52
<PAGE>   57

reason of the provisions of Section 8.02 or 8.03 requiring such Bank to
designate a different Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time
when the circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

(f) Anything in this Section 9.07 to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Bank may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Loans
and/or obligations owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States
Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Operating Circular issued by such
Federal Reserve Bank, provided that any payment in respect of such assigned
Loans and/or obligations made by the Borrower to the assigning and/or pledging
Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the Borrower's
obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Loans and/or obligations to
the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the assigning
and/or pledging Bank from its obligations hereunder.

SECTION 9.08. Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees to exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to keep any information delivered or made
available by the Borrower to it which is clearly indicated to be confidential
information, confidential from anyone other than persons employed or retained by
such Bank who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving,
structuring or administering the Loans; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall prevent any Bank from disclosing such information (i) to any other Bank,
(ii) upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (iii) upon the
request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over
such Bank, (iv) which has been publicly disclosed, (v) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation to which the Agent, any Bank or their
respective Affiliates may be a party, (vi) to the extent reasonably required in
connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (vii) to such Bank's legal
counsel and independent auditors and (viii) to any actual or proposed
Participant, Assignee or other Transferee of all or part of its rights hereunder
which has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.08.

SECTION 9.09. Representation by Banks. Each Bank hereby
represents that it is a commercial lender or financial institution which makes
loans in the ordinary course of its business and that it will make its Loans
hereunder for its own account in the ordinary course of such business; provided,
however, that, subject to Section 9.07, the disposition of the Note or Notes
held by that Bank shall at all times be within its exclusive control.

SECTION 9.10. Obligations Several. The obligations of each
Bank hereunder are several, and no Bank shall be responsible for the obligations
or commitment of any other Bank hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement
and no action taken by the Banks pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute
the Banks to be a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind
of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Bank shall be a
separate and independent debt, and each Bank shall be entitled to protect and
enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
it shall not be necessary for any other Bank to be joined as an additional party
in any proceeding for such purpose.



53
<PAGE>   58

SECTION 9.11. Survival of Certain Obligations. Sections
8.03(a), 8.03(b), 8.05 and 9.03, and the obligations of the Borrower thereunder,
shall survive, and shall continue to be enforceable notwithstanding, the
termination of this Agreement and the Commitments and the payment in full of the
principal of and interest on all Loans.

SECTION 9.12. Georgia Law. This Agreement and each Note shall
be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of Georgia.

SECTION 9.13. Severability. In case any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan
Documents should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and
shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.

SECTION 9.14. Interest. In no event shall the amount of
interest due or payable hereunder or under the Notes exceed the maximum rate of
interest allowed by applicable law, and in the event any such payment is
inadvertently made to any Bank by the Borrower or inadvertently received by any
Bank, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless
the Borrower shall notify such Bank in writing that it elects to have such
excess sum returned forthwith. It is the express intent hereof that the Borrower
not pay and the Banks not receive, directly or indirectly in any manner
whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may legally be paid by the Borrower
under applicable law.

SECTION 9.15. Interpretation. No provision of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents shall be construed against or interpreted to
the disadvantage of any party hereto by any court or other governmental or
judicial authority by reason of such party having or being deemed to have
structured or dictated such provision.

SECTION 9.16. Consent to Jurisdiction. The Borrower (a)
submits to personal jurisdiction in the State of Georgia, the courts thereof and
the United States District Courts sitting therein, for the enforcement of this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, (b) waives any and all
personal rights under the law of any jurisdiction to object on any basis
(including, without limitation, inconvenience of forum) to jurisdiction or venue
within the State of Georgia for the purpose of litigation to enforce this
Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents, and (c) agrees that service of
process may be made upon it in the manner prescribed in Section 9.01 for the
giving of notice to the Borrower. Nothing herein contained, however, shall
prevent the Agent from bringing any action or exercising any rights against any
security and against the Borrower personally, and against any assets of the
Borrower, within any other state or jurisdiction.

SECTION 9.17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

OPINION OF
COUNSEL FOR THE BORROWER

[Dated as provided in Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement]

To the Banks and the Agent
Referred to Below
c/o Wachovia Bank, N.A.,
as Agent
191 Peachtree Street, N.E.
Atlanta, Georgia  30303

Dear Sirs:

We have acted as counsel for Hancock Fabrics, Inc. (the
"Borrower") in connection with the Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement")
dated as of April 16, 1999 among the Borrower, the banks listed on the signature
pages thereof and Wachovia Bank, N.A., as Agent. Terms defined in the Credit
Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such
other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable
for purposes of this opinion. We have assumed for purposes of our opinions set
forth below that the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by each Bank
and by the Agent have been duly authorized by each Bank and by the Agent. As to
questions of fact relating to the Borrower material to such opinions, we have
relied upon representations of appropriate officers of the Borrower.

Upon the basis of the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has
all corporate powers required to carry on its business as now conducted.

2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the
Credit Agreement and the Notes (i) are within the Borrower's corporate powers,
(ii) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, (iii) require
no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or
official, (iv) do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision
of applicable law or regulation or of the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Borrower or of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree
or other instrument which to our knowledge is binding upon the Borrower and (v)
to our knowledge, except as provided in the Credit Agreement, do not result in
the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries.



1
<PAGE>   73

3. The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms,
and the Notes constitute valid and binding obligations of the Borrower,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by: (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity.

4. To our knowledge, there is no action, suit or proceeding
pending, or threatened, against or affecting the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or
official in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which
could materially adversely affect the business, consolidated financial position
or consolidated results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, or which in any manner questions the
validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any Note.

5. Each of the Borrower's Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry
on its business as now conducted.

6. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an
"investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

7. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding
company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of
a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", as such
terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

We are qualified to practice in the State of ______________ and do
not purport to be experts on any laws other than the laws of the United States,
the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and the State of ___________, and
this opinion is rendered only with respect to such laws. We have made no
independent investigation of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction wherein
any Bank may be located which limits rates of interest which may be charged or
collected by such Bank other than in paragraph 3 with respect to the State of
________________.

This opinion is delivered to you in connection with the
transaction referenced above and may only be relied upon by you or any Assignee,
Participant or other Transferee under the Credit Agreement, without our prior
written consent.

Very truly yours,

OPINION OF
WOMBLE CARLYLE SANDRIDGE & RICE, PLLC,
SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR THE AGENT




[Date as provided in Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement]

To the Banks and the Agent
Referred to Below
c/o Wachovia Bank, N.A.,
as Agent
191 Peachtree Street, N.E.
Atlanta, Georgia  30303-1757

Dear Sirs:

We have participated in the preparation of the Credit Agreement
(the "Credit Agreement") dated as of April 16, 1999 among Hancock Fabrics Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the banks listed on the signature pages
thereof (the "Banks") and Wachovia Bank, N.A., as Agent (the "Agent"), and have
acted as special counsel for the Agent for the purpose of rendering this opinion
pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement. Terms defined in the Credit
Agreement are used herein as therein defined.

This opinion letter is limited by, and is in accordance with, the
January 1, 1992 edition of the Interpretive Standards applicable to Legal
Opinions to Third Parties in Corporate Transactions adopted by the Legal Opinion
Committee of the Corporate and Banking Law Section of the State Bar of Georgia
which Interpretive Standards are incorporated herein by this reference.

We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records,
certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such
other investigations of fact and law as we have deemed necessary or advisable
for purposes of this opinion.

Upon the basis of the foregoing, and assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and each of the
Notes by or on behalf of the Borrower, we are of the opinion that the Credit
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Borrower and each
Note constitutes valid and binding obligations of the Borrower, in each case
enforceable in accordance with its terms except as: (i) the enforceability
thereof may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance, voidable preference, moratorium or similar laws applicable to
creditors' rights or the collection of debtors' obligations



1
<PAGE>   75

generally; (ii)rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable remedies
may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability; and (iii)the
enforceability of certain of the remedial, waiver and other provisions of the
Credit Agreement and the Notes may be further limited by the laws of the State
of Georgia; provided, however, such additional laws do not, in our opinion,
substantially interfere with the practical realization of the benefits expressed
in the Credit Agreement and the Notes, except for the economic consequences of
any procedural delay which may result from such laws.

In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no opinion as to the
effect (if any) of any law of any jurisdiction except the State of Georgia. We
express no opinion as to the effect of the compliance or noncompliance of the
Agent or any of the Banks with any state or federal laws or regulations
applicable to the Agent or any of the Banks by reason of the legal or regulatory
status or the nature of the business of the Agent or any of the Banks.

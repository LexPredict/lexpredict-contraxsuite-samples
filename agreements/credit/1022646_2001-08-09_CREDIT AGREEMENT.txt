Letter of Credit so long as any Default or Event of Default exists) and relying
on the representations and warranties contained in this Credit Agreement, the
Lender agrees, during the Commitment Period, to issue Letters of Credit
following the receipt not less than two Business Days prior to the requested
date for issuance of the relevant Letter of Credit, of a Letter of Credit
Application executed by the Borrower; provided, however, (a) no Letter of Credit
shall have an expiration date which is more than 360 days after the issuance
thereof or subsequent to the Commitment Termination Date, and (b) the Lender
shall not be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if (i) the face amount
thereof would exceed the Available Commitment, or (ii) after giving effect to
the issuance thereof, (A) the L/C Exposure, when added to the Loan Balance then
outstanding, would exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect, or (B) the L/C
Exposure would exceed $2,000,000.

(b) Should the Lender be called upon by the beneficiary of any Letter
of Credit to honor all or any portion of the commitment thereunder, whether upon
the presentation of drafts or otherwise, such payment by the Lender on account
of such Letter of Credit shall be treated, for all purposes, as a Floating Rate
Loan and an advance against the Note.

2.3  Use of Loan Proceeds and Letters of Credit.  (a) As of the date
hereof, indebtedness in the principal amount of $6,150,000 is outstanding under
the Existing Note.  The Lender shall use proceeds of the initial Loan to
purchase such indebtedness.  Such indebtedness shall be renewed, extended, and
rearranged pursuant to the terms of this Credit Agreement, the Note, and the
relevant Borrowing Request and shall for all purposes be deemed a borrowing
hereunder. Proceeds of all subsequent Loans shall be used solely for (i) the
acquisition and development of Oil and Gas Properties, (ii) working capital,
(iii) Letters of Credit, and (iv) general corporate purposes.

(b) Letters of Credit shall be used solely for general corporate
purposes.

2.4  Interest.  Subject to the terms of this Credit Agreement
(including, without limitation, Section 2.17), interest on the Loans shall
accrue and be payable at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for each
Floating Rate Loan and the Adjusted LIBO Rate for each LIBO Rate Loan. Interest
on all Floating Rate Loans shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day)

16
<PAGE>

during the period for which payable. Interest on all LIBO Rate Loans shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, and actual days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day) during the period for which payable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, interest on past-due principal and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, past-due interest, shall accrue at the Default
Rate, computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
and actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day)
during the period for which payable, and shall be payable upon demand by the
Lender at any time as to all or any portion of such interest. In the event that
the Borrower fails to select the duration of any Interest Period for any LIBO
Rate Loan within the time period and otherwise as provided herein, such Loan (if
outstanding as a LIBO Rate Loan) will be automatically converted into a Floating
Rate Loan on the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan or
(if outstanding as a Floating Rate Loan) will remain as, or (if not then
outstanding) will be made as, a Floating Rate Loan. Interest provided for herein
shall be calculated on unpaid sums actually advanced and outstanding pursuant to
the terms of this Credit Agreement and only for the period from the date or
dates of such advances until repayment.

2.5  Repayment of Loans and Interest.  Accrued and unpaid interest on
each outstanding Floating Rate Loan shall be due and payable monthly commencing
on the first day of April, 2000, and continuing on the first day of each
calendar month thereafter while any Floating Rate Loan remains outstanding, the
payment in each instance to be the amount of interest which has accrued and
remains unpaid in respect of the relevant Loan.  Accrued and unpaid interest on
each outstanding LIBO Rate Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of the
Interest Period for such LIBO Rate Loan and, in the case of any Interest Period
in excess of three months, on the day of the third calendar month following the
commencement of such Interest Period corresponding to the day of the calendar
month on which such Interest Period commenced, the payment in each instance to
be the amount of interest which has accrued and remains unpaid in respect of the
relevant Loan.  The Loan Balance, together with all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, shall be due and payable at Final Maturity.  At the time of making each
payment hereunder or under the Note, the Borrower shall specify to the Lender
the Loans or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such
payment is to be applied.  In the event the Borrower fails to so specify, or if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Lender may apply such
payment as it may elect in its sole discretion.

2.6  Outstanding Amounts.  The outstanding principal balance of the
Note reflected by the notations by the Lender on its records shall be deemed
rebuttably presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing on the Note.  The
liability for payment of principal and interest evidenced by the Note shall be
limited to principal amounts actually advanced and outstanding pursuant to this
Credit Agreement and interest on such amounts calculated in accordance with this
Credit Agreement.

2.7  Time, Place, and Method of Payments.  All payments required
pursuant to this Credit Agreement or the Note shall be made in lawful money of
the United States of America and in immediately available funds, shall be deemed
received by the Lender on the next Business Day following receipt if such
receipt is after 2:00 p.m., Central Standard or Daylight Savings Time, as the
case may be, on any Business Day, and shall be made at the Principal Office.
Except as provided to the contrary herein, if the due date of any payment
hereunder or under the Note would otherwise fall on a day which is not a
Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding

17
<PAGE>

Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so extended for
the period of such extension.

2.8  Borrowing Base Determinations.  (a) The Borrowing Base as of the
Closing Date is acknowledged by the Borrower and the Lender to be $18,000,000.

(b) The Borrowing Base shall be redetermined semi-annually 45 days
after receipt of the Reserve Report delivered pursuant to Section 5.4 on the
basis of information supplied by the Borrower in compliance with the provisions
of this Credit Agreement, including, without limitation, Reserve Reports, and
all other information available to the Lender.  In addition, the Lender shall,
in the normal course of business following a request of the Borrower,
redetermine the Borrowing Base; provided, however, the Lender shall not be
obligated to respond to more than two such requests during any calendar year,
and in no event shall the Lender be required to redetermine the Borrowing Base
more than once in any three-month period, including, without limitation, each
scheduled semi-annual redetermination provided for above.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Lender may at its discretion redetermine the Borrowing Base at
any time and from time to time.

(c) Upon each determination of the Borrowing Base by the Lender, the
Lender shall notify the Borrower orally (confirming such notice promptly in
writing) of the amount of the Borrowing Base resulting from such determination.
The Borrowing Base so communicated to the Borrower shall become effective upon
such written notification and shall remain in effect until notice of the next
subsequent determination of the Borrowing Base.

(d) The Borrowing Base shall represent the determination by the
Lender, in accordance with the applicable definitions and provisions herein
contained and its customary lending practices for loans of this nature, of the
value, for loan purposes, of the Mortgaged Properties, subject, in the case of
any increase in the Borrowing Base, to the credit approval process of the
Lender.  Furthermore, the Borrower acknowledges that the determination of the
Borrowing Base contains an equity cushion (market value in excess of loan
value), which is acknowledged by the Borrower to be essential for the adequate
protection of the Lender.

2.9  Mandatory Prepayments.  If at any time the sum of the Loan
Balance and the L/C Exposure exceeds the Borrowing Base then in effect, the
Borrower shall, within 60 days of notice from the Lender of such occurrence, (a)
prepay, or make arrangements acceptable to the Lender for the prepayment of, the
amount of such excess for application on the Loan Balance, (b) provide
additional collateral, of character and value satisfactory to the Lender in its
sole discretion, to secure the Obligations by the execution and delivery to the
Lender of security instruments in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender,
or (c) effect any combination of the alternatives described in clauses (a) and
(b) of this Section and acceptable to the Lender in its sole discretion.  In the
event that a mandatory prepayment is required under this Section and the Loan
Balance is less than the amount required to be prepaid, the Borrower shall repay
the entire Loan Balance and, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant
Letter of Credit Applications executed by the Borrower or otherwise to the
satisfaction of the Lender, deposit with the Lender, as additional collateral
securing the Obligations, an amount of cash, in immediately available funds,
equal to the L/C Exposure minus the Borrowing Base.  The cash deposited with the
Lender in satisfaction of the requirement provided in this Section may be
invested, at the sole discretion of the Lender and then only at the express

18
<PAGE>

direction of the Borrower as to investment vehicle and maturity (which shall be
no later than the latest expiry date of any then outstanding Letter of Credit),
for the account of the Borrower in cash or cash equivalent investments offered
by or through the Lender.

2.10  Voluntary Prepayments and Conversions of Loans.   Subject to
applicable provisions of this Credit Agreement, the Borrower shall have the
right at any time or from time to time to prepay Loans and to convert Loans of
one type or with one Interest Period into Loans of another type or with a
different Interest Period; provided, however, that (a) the Borrower shall give
the Lender notice of each such prepayment or conversion of all or any portion of
a LIBO Rate Loan no less than two Business Days prior to prepayment or
conversion, (b) any LIBO Rate Loan may be prepaid or converted only on the last
day of an Interest Period for such Loan, (c) the Borrower shall pay all accrued
and unpaid interest on the amounts prepaid or converted, and (d) no such
prepayment or conversion shall serve to postpone the repayment when due of any
Obligation.

2.11  Commitment Fee.  In addition to interest on the Note as provided
herein and all other fees payable hereunder and to compensate the Lender for
maintaining funds available, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, in
immediately available funds, on the first day of April, 2000, and on the first
day of each third calendar month thereafter during the Commitment Period, a fee
in the amount of three-eighths percent (3/8%) per annum, calculated on the basis
of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day), on the average daily
amount of the Available Commitment during the preceding quarterly period.

2.12  Engineering Fee.  In addition to interest on the Note as
provided herein and all other fees payable hereunder and to compensate the
Lender for the costs of evaluating the Mortgaged Properties and reviewing the
Reserve Reports, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, in immediately available
funds, on the date of each redetermination of the Borrowing Base, an engineering
fee in the amount of $7,500.

2.13  Facility Fee.  In addition to interest on the Note as provided
herein and all other fees payable hereunder and to compensate the Lender for the
costs of the extension of credit hereunder, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender
on the Closing Date, in immediately available funds, a facility fee in the
amount of $90,000.  Any future increases in the Borrowing Base shall entitle the
Lender to a one-half percent (1/2%) fee of the increase in the Borrowing Base
which shall be paid by the Borrower within two days of such notification.

2.14  Letter of Credit Fee.  In addition to interest on the Note as
provided herein and all other fees payable hereunder, the Borrower agrees to pay
to the Lender, on the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit, a fee equal to
the greater of the Lender's minimum rate at the time of issuance of the Letter
of Credit or two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) per annum, calculated on the
basis of a year of 360 days 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day), on the face amount
of such Letter of Credit during the period for which such Letter of Credit is
issued; provided, however, in the event such Letter of Credit is canceled prior
to its original expiry date or a payment is made by the Lender with respect to
such Letter of Credit, the Lender shall, within 30 days after such cancellation
or the making of such payment, rebate to the Borrower the unearned portion of
such fee.  The Borrower also agrees to pay

19
<PAGE>

to the Lender on demand its customary letter of credit transactional fees,
including, without limitation, amendment fees, payable with respect to each
Letter of Credit.

2.15  Security Interest in Accounts; Right of Offset.  As security for
the payment and performance of the Obligations, the Borrower hereby transfers,
assigns, and pledges to the Lender and grants to the Lender a security interest
in all funds of the Borrower now or hereafter or from time to time on deposit
with the Lender, with such interest of the Lender to be retransferred,
reassigned, and/or released by the Lender, as the case may be, at the expense of
the Borrower upon payment in full and complete performance by the Borrower of
all Obligations.  All remedies as secured party or assignee of such funds shall
be exercisable by the Lender upon the occurrence of any Event of Default,
regardless of whether the exercise of any such remedy would result in any
penalty or loss of interest or profit with respect to any withdrawal of funds
deposited in a time deposit account prior to the maturity thereof.  Furthermore,
the Borrower hereby grants to the Lender the right, exercisable at such time as
any Obligation shall mature, whether by acceleration of maturity or otherwise,
of offset or banker's lien against all funds of the Borrower now or hereafter or
from time to time on deposit with the Lender, regardless of whether the exercise
of any such remedy would result in any penalty or loss of interest or profit
with respect to any withdrawal of funds deposited in a time deposit account
prior to the maturity thereof.

2.16  General Provisions Relating to Interest.  (a) It is the
intention of the parties hereto to comply strictly with the usury laws of the
State of Texas and the United States of America. In this connection, there shall
never be collected, charged, or received on the sums advanced hereunder interest
in excess of that which would accrue at the Highest Lawful Rate. For purposes of
Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code (Vernon's 1999), the Borrower agrees that
the Highest Lawful Rate shall be the "weekly ceiling" as defined in such
Section, provided that the Lender may also rely, to the extent permitted by
applicable laws of the State of Texas or the United States of America, on
alternative maximum rates of interest under other laws of the State of Texas or
the United States of America applicable to the Lender, if greater.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Note to the contrary,
during any Limitation Period, the interest rate to be charged on amounts
evidenced by the Note shall be the Highest Lawful Rate, and the obligation, if
any, of the Borrower for the payment of fees or other charges deemed to be
interest under applicable law shall be suspended.  During any period or periods
of time following a Limitation Period, to the extent permitted by applicable
laws of the State of Texas or the United States of America, the interest rate to
be charged hereunder shall remain at the Highest Lawful Rate until such time as
there has been paid to the Lender (i) the amount of interest in excess of that
accruing at the Highest Lawful Rate that the Lender would have received during
the Limitation Period had the interest rate remained at the otherwise applicable
rate, and (ii) all interest and fees otherwise payable to the Lender but for the
effect of such Limitation Period.

(c) If, under any circumstances, the aggregate amounts paid on the
Note or under this Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document include amounts
which by law are deemed interest and which would exceed the amount permitted if
the Highest Lawful Rate were in effect, the Borrower stipulates that such
payment and collection will have been and will be deemed to have been, to the
extent permitted by applicable laws of the State of Texas or the United States
of America, the result of mathematical error on the part of the Borrower and the
Lender; and the Lender

20
<PAGE>

shall promptly refund the amount of such excess (to the extent only of such
interest payments in excess of that which would have accrued and been payable on
the basis of the Highest Lawful Rate) upon discovery of such error by the Lender
or notice thereof from the Borrower. In the event that the maturity of any
Obligation is accelerated, by reason of an election by the Lender or otherwise,
or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then the consideration
constituting interest under applicable laws may never exceed the Highest Lawful
Rate; and excess amounts paid which by law are deemed interest, if any, shall be
credited by the Lender on the principal amount of the Obligations, or if the
principal amount of the Obligations shall have been paid in full, refunded to
the Borrower.

(d) All sums paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Lender for the use,
forbearance and detention of the proceeds of any advance hereunder shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and
spread throughout the full term hereof until paid in full so that the actual
rate of interest is uniform but does not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate
throughout the full term hereof.

2.17  Yield Protection.  (a) Without limiting the effect of the other
provisions of this Section (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay to
the Lender from time to time such amounts as the Lender may determine are
necessary to compensate it for any Additional Costs incurred by the Lender.

(b) Without limiting the effect of the other provisions of this
Section (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay to the Lender from
time to time on request such amounts as the Lender may determine are necessary
to compensate the Lender for any costs attributable to the maintenance by the
Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office), pursuant to any Regulatory Change, of
capital in respect of the Commitment, such compensation to include, without
limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate of return on assets or
equity of the Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office) to a level below that
which the Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office) could have achieved but for
such Regulatory Change.

(c) Without limiting the effect of the other provisions of this
Section (but without duplication), in the event that any Requirement of Law or
Regulatory Change or the compliance by the Lender therewith shall (i) impose,
modify, or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement
against any Letter of Credit or obligation to issue Letters of Credit, or (ii)
impose upon the Lender any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit or
obligation to issue Letters of Credit, and the result of any such event shall be
to increase the cost to the Lender of issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or obligation to issue Letters of Credit or any liability with respect to
payments by the Lender under Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount
receivable in connection therewith, then upon demand by the Lender, the Borrower
shall pay to the Lender, from time to time as specified by the Lender,
additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the Lender for such
increased cost or reduced amount receivable.

(d) Without limiting the effect of the other provisions of this
Section (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay to the Lender such
amounts as shall be sufficient in the reasonable opinion of the Lender to
compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense incurred by and as a result of:

21
<PAGE>

(i) any payment, prepayment, or conversion by the Borrower of a LIBO Rate
Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loan; or

(ii) any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBO Rate Loan from the
Lender on the date for such borrowing specified in the relevant Borrowing
Request;

such compensation to include, without limitation, with respect to any LIBO Rate
Loan, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the amount of interest which
would have accrued on the principal amount so paid, prepaid, converted, or not
borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, conversion,
or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current Interest Period for
such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such
Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure to borrow) at the
LIBO Rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein over (B) the interest
component (as reasonably determined by the Lender) of the amount (as reasonably
determined by the Lender) the Lender would have bid in the London interbank
market for Dollar deposits of amounts comparable to such principal amount and
maturities comparable to such period.

(e) Determinations by the Lender for purposes of this Section of the
effect of any Regulatory Change on capital maintained, its costs or rate of
return, maintaining Loans, issuing Letters of Credit, its obligation to make
Loans and issue Letters of Credit, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of
Loans, Letters of Credit, or such obligations, and the additional amounts
required to compensate the Lender under this Section shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable
basis.  The Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a certificate setting forth
in reasonable detail the basis and amount of increased costs incurred or reduced
amounts receivable as a result of any such event, and the statements set forth
therein shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  The Lender shall (i) notify
the Borrower, as promptly as practicable after the Lender obtains knowledge of
any Additional Costs or other sums payable pursuant to this Section and
determines to request compensation therefor, of any event occurring after the
Closing Date which will entitle the Lender to compensation pursuant to this
Section; provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated for the payment of
any Additional Costs or other sums payable pursuant to this Section to the
extent such Additional Costs or other sums accrued more than 90 days prior to
the date upon which the Borrower was given such notice; and (ii) designate a
different Applicable Lending Office for the Loans of the Lender affected by such
event if such designation will avoid the need for or reduce the amount of such
compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of the Lender, be disadvantageous
to the Lender.  If the Lender requests compensation from the Borrower under this
Section, the Borrower may, by notice to the Lender, require that the Loans by
the Lender of the type with respect to which such compensation is requested be
converted into Floating Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.10.  Any
compensation requested by the Lender pursuant to this Section shall be due and
payable to the Lender within five days of delivery of any such notice by the
Lender to the Borrower.

(f) The Lender agrees that it shall not request, and the Borrower
shall not be obligated to pay, any Additional Costs or other sums payable
pursuant to this Section unless similar additional costs and other sums payable
are also generally assessed by the Lender against other customers of

22
<PAGE>

the Lender similarly situated where such customers are subject to documents
providing for such assessment.

2.18  Limitation on Types of Loans.  Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no more than 5 separate Loans shall be outstanding at any one
time, with, for purposes of this Section, all Floating Rate Loans constituting
one Loan and all LIBO Rate Loans for the same Interest Period constituting one
Loan.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the
determination of any interest rate for any LIBO Rate Loan for any Interest
Period therefor:

(a) the Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
that quotations of interest rates for the deposits referred to in the
definition of "LIBO Rate" in Section 1.2 are not being provided in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining
the rate of interest for such Loan as provided in this Credit Agreement; or

(b) the Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
that the rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBO Rate" in
Section 1.2 upon the basis of which the rate of interest for such Loan for
such Interest Period is to be determined do not accurately reflect the cost
to the Lender of making or maintaining such Loan for such Interest Period,

then the Lender shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof; and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lender shall be under no obligation to
make LIBO Rate Loans or to convert Loans of any other type into LIBO Rate Loans,
and the Borrower shall, on the last day of the then current Interest Period for
each outstanding LIBO Rate Loan, either prepay such LIBO Rate Loan or convert
such Loan into another type of Loan in accordance with Section 2.10.  Before
giving such notice pursuant to this Section, the Lender will designate a
different available Applicable Lending Office for LIBO Rate Loans or take such
other action as the Borrower may request if such designation or action will
avoid the need to suspend the obligation of the Lender to make LIBO Rate Loans
hereunder and will not, in the opinion of the Lender, be disadvantageous to the
Lender.

2.19  Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for the Lender or its
Applicable Lending Office to (a) honor its obligation to make any type of LIBO
Rate Loans hereunder, or (b) maintain any type of LIBO Rate Loans hereunder,
then the Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof; and the obligation
of the Lender hereunder to make such type of LIBO Rate Loans and to convert
other types of Loans into LIBO Rate Loans of such type shall be suspended until
such time as the Lender may again make and maintain LIBO Rate Loans of such
type, and the outstanding LIBO Rate Loans of such type shall be converted into
Floating Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.10.  Before giving such notice
pursuant to this Section, the Lender will designate a different available
Applicable Lending Office for LIBO Rate Loans or take such other action as the
Borrower may request if such designation or action will avoid the need to
suspend the obligation of the Lender to make LIBO Rate Loans and will not, in
the opinion of the Lender, be disadvantageous to the Lender.

23
<PAGE>

2.20  Regulatory Change.  In the event that by reason of any
Regulatory Change, the Lender (a) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured
by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or
other liabilities of the Lender which includes deposits by reference to which
the interest rate on any LIBO Rate Loan is determined as provided in this Credit
Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender
which includes any LIBO Rate Loan, or (b) becomes subject to restrictions on the
amount of such a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold, then, at
the election of the Lender with notice to the Borrower, the obligation of the
Lender to make such LIBO Rate Loans and to convert Floating Rate Loans into such
LIBO Rate Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Regulatory Change
ceases to be in effect, and all such outstanding LIBO Rate Loans shall be
converted into Floating Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.10.

2.21  Limitations on Interest Periods.  Each Interest Period selected
by the Borrower (a) which commences on the last Business Day of a calendar month
(or, with respect to any LIBO Rate Loan, any day for which there is no
numerically corresponding day in the appropriate subsequent calendar month)
shall end on the last Business Day of the appropriate subsequent calendar month,
(b) which would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day shall end on
the next succeeding Business Day (or, if such next succeeding Business Day falls
in the next succeeding calendar month, on the next preceding Business Day), (c)
which would otherwise commence before and end after Final Maturity shall end on
Final Maturity, and (d) shall have a duration of not less than one month, as to
any LIBO Rate Loan, and, if any Interest Period would otherwise be a shorter
period, the relevant Loan shall be a Floating Rate Loan during such period.

2.22  Letters in Lieu of Transfer Orders.  The Lender agrees that none
of the letters in lieu of transfer or division orders provided by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 3.1(g)(iii) or Section 5.7 will be sent to the addressees
thereof prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, at which time the Lender
may, at its option and in addition to the exercise of any of its other rights
and remedies, send any or all of such letters pursuant to Section 7.1(a), (f)
and (g).

2.23  Power of Attorney.  The Borrower hereby designates the Lender as
its agent and attorney-in-fact, to act in its name, place, and stead for the
purpose of completing and, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
delivering any and all of the letters in lieu of transfer orders delivered by
the Borrower to the Lender pursuant to Section 3.1(g)(iii) or Section 5.7,
including, without limitation, completing any blanks contained in such letters
and attaching exhibits thereto describing the relevant Collateral.  The Borrower
hereby ratifies and confirms all that the Lender shall lawfully do or cause to
be done by virtue of this power of attorney and the rights granted with respect
to such power of attorney.  This power of attorney is coupled with the interests
of the Lender in the Collateral, shall commence and be in full force and effect
as of the Closing Date and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
irrevocable so long as any Obligation remains outstanding or unpaid or any
Commitment exists.  The powers conferred on the Lender by this appointment are
solely to protect the interests of the Lender under the Loan Documents and shall
not impose any duty upon the Lender to exercise any such powers.  The Lender
shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of
the exercise of such powers and shall not be responsible to the Borrower or any
other Person for any act or failure to act with respect to such powers, except
for gross negligence or willful misconduct.

ARTICLE VII

MISCELLANEOUS

8.1  Successors and Assigns.  The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the Borrower
shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Loan
Documents and (ii) any assignment by the Lender must be made in compliance with
Section 8.3.  Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section, the Lender may at any
time, without the consent of the Borrower, assign all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve bank; provided,
however, that no such assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank shall release the
transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder.  Any assignee or transferee of
the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by
all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents.  Any request, authority or
consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a
Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on
any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

8.2  Participations. The Lender may, in the ordinary course of its
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any  time sell to one or more
banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan
owing to it, any Note held by it, the Commitment

43
<PAGE>

or any other interest of the Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of
any such sale by the Lender of participating interests to a Participant, the
Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, the Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance
of such obligations, the Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the
holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the
Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower under this Agreement shall
be determined as if the Lender had not sold such participating interests, and
the Borrower and the Lender shall continue to deal solely and directly with each
other in connection with the Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
Documents. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the
right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under
the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating
interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents,
provided that the Lender shall retain the right of setoff with respect to the
amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lender agrees to
share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of
setoff agrees to share with the Lender, any amount received pursuant to the
exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance as if
each Participant were a Lender.

8.3  Assignments.  The Lender may, in the ordinary course of its
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one or
more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and
obligations under the Loan Documents.  Each Borrower and the Lender hereby agree
to execute any amendment and/or any other document that may be necessary to
effectuate such an assignment.  Such documents shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to each Borrower and the Lender.  Such assignment shall be
evidenced by the Lender's standard form (to be supplied upon request).  The
consent of the Borrower shall be required prior to an assignment becoming
effective with respect to a Purchaser that is not a Lender or an affiliate
thereof; provided, however, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing,
the consent of the Borrower shall not be required.  Upon delivering to the
Borrower a notice of assignment, together with any required consent, such
assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such notice
of assignment.  On and after the effective date of such assignment, such
Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to the other Loan Documents
and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no
further consent or action by the Borrower shall be required to release the
Lender with respect to the percentage of the Commitment and Loans assigned to
such Purchaser.  Upon the consummation of any such assignment to a Purchaser,
the transferor Lender, the Lender and the Borrower shall, if the Lender or the
Purchaser desires, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as
appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to the Lender and Purchaser, in each
case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted
pursuant to such assignment.

8.4  Dissemination of Information; Tax Treatment.  The Borrower
authorizes the Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other
Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a
"Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in the
Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.  If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any
Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer,

44
<PAGE>

to deliver to the Lender such completed forms with respect to withholding taxes
as the Borrower may reasonably require.

8.5  Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Covenants.  All
representations and warranties of the Borrower and all covenants and agreements
herein made shall survive the execution and delivery of the Note and the
Security Instruments and shall remain in force and effect so long as any
Obligation is outstanding or any Commitment exists.

8.6  Notices and Other Communications.  Except as to oral notices
expressly authorized herein, which oral notices shall be confirmed in writing,
all notices, requests, and communications hereunder shall be in writing
(including by telecopy).  Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, any such
notice, request, demand, or other communication shall be deemed to have been
duly given or made when delivered by hand, or, in the case of delivery by mail,
when deposited in the mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, or, in the case of telecopy notice, when receipt thereof is
acknowledged orally or by written confirmation report, addressed as follows:

Any party may, by proper written notice hereunder to the others,
change the individuals or addresses to which such notices to it shall thereafter
be sent.

8.7  Parties in Interest.  Subject to the restrictions on changes in
corporate structure set forth in Section 6.9 and other applicable restrictions
contained herein, all covenants and agreements herein contained by or on behalf
of the Borrower or the Lender shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower or the Lender, as the case may be, and their respective legal
representatives, successors, and assigns.

45
<PAGE>

8.8  Rights of Third Parties.  All provisions herein are imposed
solely and exclusively for the benefit of the Lender and the Borrower.  No other
Person shall have any right, benefit, priority, or interest hereunder or as a
result hereof or have standing to require satisfaction of provisions hereof in
accordance with their terms, and any or all of such provisions may be freely
waived in whole or in part by the Lender at any time if in its sole discretion
it deems it advisable to do so.

8.9  Renewals; Extensions.  All provisions of this Credit Agreement
relating to the Note shall apply with equal force and effect to each promissory
note hereafter executed which in whole or in part represents a renewal or
extension of any part of the Indebtedness of the Borrower under this Credit
Agreement, the Note, or any other Loan Document.

8.10  No Waiver; Rights Cumulative.  No course of dealing on the part
of the Lender, its officers or employees, nor any failure or delay by the Lender
with respect to exercising any of its rights under any Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof.  The rights of the Lender under the Loan Documents
shall be cumulative and the exercise or partial exercise of any such right shall
not preclude the exercise of any other right.  Neither the making of any Loan
nor the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall constitute a waiver of any of the
covenants, warranties, or conditions of the Borrower contained herein.  In the
event the Borrower is unable to satisfy any such covenant, warranty, or
condition, neither the making of any Loan nor the issuance of a Letter of Credit
shall have the effect of precluding the Lender from thereafter declaring such
inability to be an Event of Default as hereinabove provided.

8.11  Survival Upon Unenforceability.  In the event any one or more of
the provisions contained in any of the Loan Documents or in any other instrument
referred to herein or executed in connection with the Obligations shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
of any Loan Document or of any other instrument referred to herein or executed
in connection with such Obligations.

8.12  Amendments; Waivers.  Neither this Credit Agreement nor any
provision hereof may be amended, waived, discharged, or terminated orally, but
only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of
the amendment, waiver, discharge, or termination is sought.

8.13  Controlling Agreement.  In the event of a conflict between the
provisions of this Credit Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Credit Agreement shall control.

8.14  Disposition of Collateral.  Notwithstanding any term or
provision, express or implied, in any of the Security Instruments, the
realization, liquidation, foreclosure, or any other disposition on or of any or
all of the Collateral shall be in the order and manner and determined in the
sole discretion of the Lender; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Lender violate applicable law or exercise rights and remedies other than those
provided in such Security Instruments or otherwise existing at law or in equity.

46
<PAGE>

8.15  GOVERNING LAW.  THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE NOTE SHALL BE
DEEMED TO BE CONTRACTS MADE UNDER AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND
GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES
THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICTS OF LAW; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT CHAPTER 345 OF THE
TEXAS FINANCE CODE (WHICH REGULATES CERTAIN REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN ACCOUNTS AND
REVOLVING TRIPARTY ACCOUNTS) SHALL NOT APPLY.

8.16  JURISDICTION AND VENUE.  ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT
TO, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH, OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR
FROM THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE LITIGATED, AT THE
SOLE DISCRETION AND ELECTION OF THE LENDER, IN COURTS HAVING SITUS IN HOUSTON,
HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS.  THE BORROWER HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF ANY
LOCAL, STATE, OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN HOUSTON, HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS, AND
HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO TRANSFER OR CHANGE THE JURISDICTION OR
VENUE OF ANY LITIGATION BROUGHT AGAINST IT BY THE LENDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
SECTION.

HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY, AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM,

TEXAS, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, ULTRA PETROLEUM (USA) INC., and ULTRA
RESOURCES, INC. (as amended, restated, or supplemented from time to
time, the "Credit Agreement")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel in the State of Wyoming (the "State")
to Ultra Petroleum Corporation, Ultra Petroleum (USA) Inc., and Ultra Resources,
Inc. (collectively, the "Borrower") in connection with the transactions
contemplated in the Loan Documents described below which were executed pursuant
to the Credit Agreement.  In such capacity, we furnish this Opinion with the

of Production and Financing Statement dated of even date herewith from the
Borrower in favor of the Lender (the "Mortgage"); and

(b) Non-Standard Financing Statement constituent to the Mortgage (the
"Financing Statement").

In making such examination, we have, with your permission, assumed:

(a) the genuineness of all signatures to the Loan Documents;

(b) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and
the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as
copies;

V-i

(c) each party to any Loan Document is authorized and has the power to

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set forth

1.  No consent, approval, or other authorization of, or filing or
registration (other than as described in paragraph A.7 hereof) with, any
court, governmental agency, commission, or other authority of the State or
any subdivision thereof is required for the due execution and delivery of
the Loan Documents or for the enforceability, performance, or observance of
the terms thereof.

2.  The execution and delivery by the Borrower of each Loan Document
to which it is a party, compliance with the provisions thereof, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will not conflict
with or result in a violation of any law or governmental rule or regulation
of the State or any subdivision thereof.

3.  The Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party constitute
legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Borrower, enforceable against
the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

4.  The forms of the Mortgage and the Financing Statement and the
description of the Mortgaged Property situated in the State satisfy all
applicable laws of the State and are legally sufficient under the laws of
the State to enable the Lender to realize the practical benefits purported
to be afforded by the Mortgage.

5.  The Mortgage (a) creates a lien upon and a security interest in
all Mortgaged Property situated in the State to secure the Indebtedness (as
such term is defined in the Mortgage and so used herein), and (b) provides
for nonjudicial foreclosure remedies customarily used in the State.

6.  The Mortgage and the Financing Statement are in satisfactory form
for filing and recording in the offices described below.

7.  The filing and/or recording, as the case may be, of (a) the
Mortgage in the office of the county clerk of each county in the State in
which any portion of the Mortgaged Property is located and as a financing
statement in the office of the

V-ii

Secretary of State of the State, and (b) the Financing Statement in the
Uniform Commercial Code records in each county in the State in which any
portion of the Mortgaged Property is located are the only recordings or
filings in the State necessary to perfect the liens and security interests
in the Mortgaged Property created by the Mortgage or to permit the Lender
to enforce in the State its rights under the Mortgage. No subsequent
filing, re-filing, recording, or re-recording will be required in the State
in order to continue the perfection of the liens and security interests
created by the Mortgage except that (a) a continuation statement must be
filed with respect to the Mortgage filed as a financing statement in the
office of the Secretary of State of the State and with respect to the
Financing Statement in the Uniform Commercial Code records in each county
in the State in which any portion of the Mortgaged Property is located,
each within six months prior to the expiration of five years from the date
of the relevant initial financing statement filing, (b) a subsequent
continuation statement must be filed within six months prior to the
expiration of each subsequent five-year period from the date of each
initial financing statement filing, and (c) amendments or supplements to

recording fees to be paid upon filing) is required to be paid to the State
or any subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery,
filing, or recording of any of the Loan Documents or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated therein.

9.  It is not necessary for the Lender to qualify to do business in
the State or file in the State any designation for service of process or
reports solely by reason of the interests conveyed or assigned to it or for
its benefit under the Mortgage, nor will such conveyances or assignments
alone result in the imposition upon the Lender of any taxes by the State or
by any subdivision thereof, including, without limitation, franchise,
license, tax on interest received or income taxes, other than recording and
filing fees in connection with the filings referred to in paragraph A.7
above and taxes which the Lender may owe in the event it becomes the actual
and record owner of any Mortgaged Property situated in the State.

10.  The foreclosure of, or exercise of the power of sale under, the
Mortgage will not in any manner restrict, affect or impair the liability of
the Borrower with respect to the indebtedness or the rights and remedies of
the Lender with respect to the foreclosure or enforcement of any other
security interests or liens securing the Indebtedness to the extent any
deficiency remains unpaid after application to the Indebtedness of the
proceeds of such foreclosure or the exercise of such power of sale.

11.  The priority of the liens and security interests created by the
Mortgage with respect to Indebtedness incurred by the Borrower on or before
the date on which the Mortgage is filed in the appropriate recording
offices referred to hereinabove will be determined by the date of such
filings.  The priority of the lien created by the Mortgage with respect to
Indebtedness incurred by the Borrower after the date the Mortgage is
recorded will be determined by the dates the Mortgage is filed.

12.  The priority of the lien created by the Mortgage will not be
affected by any prepayment of a portion, but less than all, of the
Indebtedness, or any reduction or increase of the outstanding amount of the
Indebtedness from time to time.

13.  The limitations period for enforcement of the Mortgage in the
State is ______________.

The opinions expressed herein are subject to the following qualifications
and limitations:

A.  We are licensed to practice law only in the State and other
jurisdictions whose laws are not applicable to the opinions expressed
herein; accordingly, the foregoing opinions are limited solely to the laws
of the State and applicable United States federal law.

B.  The validity, binding effect, and enforceability of the Loan
Documents may be limited or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization, or other similar laws affecting rights of creditors
generally, including, without limitation, statutes or rules of law which
limit the effect of waivers of rights by a debtor or grantor; provided,
however, that the limitations and other effects of such statutes or rules
of law upon the validity and binding effect of the Loan Documents should
not differ materially from the limitations and other effects of such
statutes or rules of law upon the validity and binding effect of
assignments and security instruments generally.

C.  The enforceability of the respective obligations of the Borrower
under the Loan Documents to which it is a party is subject to general
principles of equity (whether such enforceability is considered in a suit
in equity or at law).

This Opinion is furnished by us solely for the benefit of the Lender
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and is
not to be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise referred to or disclosed in
any other transaction.

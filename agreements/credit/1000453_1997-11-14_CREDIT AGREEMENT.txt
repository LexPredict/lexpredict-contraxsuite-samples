nonpayment, late payment or otherwise) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
asserted.  This indemnification shall be paid immediately following the date on
which such Lender makes written demand.

(c) If any Borrower or Guarantor fails to perform its obligations under

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Each Borrower and Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Lenders the
following (which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement):

4.01. Corporate Existence, Power and Authority; Subsidiaries.  Each
Borrower and Guarantor is a corporation duly organized and in good standing
under the laws of its state of incorporation and is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation and in good standing in all states or other jurisdictions where the
nature and extent of the business transacted by it or the ownership of assets
makes such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions in which the
failure to so qualify has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.  After giving effect to the Order, the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder are all within each
Borrower's and Guarantor's corporate powers, have been duly authorized and are
not in contravention of law or the terms of such Borrower's or Guarantor's
certificate of incorporation, by-laws, or other organizational documentation,
or any indenture, agreement or undertaking to which such Borrower or Guarantor
is a party or by which such Borrower or Guarantor or its property are bound.
After giving effect to the Order, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of each Borrower and Guarantor
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.  No Borrower or
Guarantor has any Subsidiaries except as set forth on Schedule IV hereto.

4.02. Financial Statements; No Material Adverse Change.  All financial
statements relating to the Borrowers and Guarantors which have been delivered
by any Borrower or Guarantor to Lenders on or prior to any date that this

only other locations of Collateral, if any, are the addresses set forth in
Schedule V hereto, subject to the right of a Borrower or Guarantor to establish
new locations in accordance with Section 6.01 below.  Schedule V correctly
identifies any of such locations which are not owned by a Borrower or Guarantor
and sets forth the owners and/or operators thereof and to the best of the
applicable Borrower's and Guarantor's knowledge, the holders of any mortgages
on such locations.

4.04. Priority of Liens; Title to Properties.  The security interests and
liens granted to Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents

and declarations is complete and accurate in all material respects.  Each
Borrower and Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all taxes due and payable
or claimed due and payable in any assessment received by it, except (a) certain
taxes with respect to periods prior to the Petition Date and (b) taxes the
validity of which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings

to which adequate reserves have been set aside on its books.  Adequate
provision has been made for the payment of all accrued and unpaid Federal,
State, county, local, foreign and other taxes whether or not yet due and
payable and whether or not disputed.

4.07. Litigation.  Except as set forth in any public filings made by any
Borrower or Guarantor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there is no
present investigation by any governmental agency pending, or to the best of any
Borrower's and Guarantor's knowledge threatened, against or affecting any
Borrower or Guarantor, its assets

an Event of Default;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described

immediately become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment,
demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by the Borrowers.

7.03. Certain Remedies.  If an Event of Default occurs, the Lenders may
exercise all rights and remedies which they may have hereunder or under any
other Loan Document or at law or in equity or otherwise.  All such remedies

ARTICLE VIII


GUARANTEE

8.01. Guarantee.  Each of the Guarantors, for consideration received,
jointly and severally unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Lenders
the due and punctual payment of the Obligations, whether or not allowed or
allowable as a claim in any proceeding commenced under any Bankruptcy Law, and
whether or not recovery of any such obligation or liability may be barred by a
statute of limitations or such obligation or liability may otherwise be
unenforceable.  All Obligations shall be conclusively presumed to have been
created in reliance on the Guarantee.  The Guarantee is a continuing guaranty
of the Obligations and may not be revoked and shall not otherwise terminate
unless and until any and all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid and
performed in full, in cash.  Nothing contained in this Article VIII shall be
deemed to limit in any way the terms of the Order.

8.02. Nature of Guarantee.  The liability of each Guarantor under the
Guarantee is independent of and not in consideration of or contingent upon the
liability of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against any Guarantor, whether or not any
action is brought or prosecuted against the Borrowers or any other Guarantor or
whether any Borrower or any other Guarantor is joined in any such action or
actions.  The Guarantee given by each Guarantor shall be construed as a
continuing, absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment (and not merely of
collection) without regard to:

(a) the legality, validity or enforceability of the Term Notes, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations, any Lien on
Collateral,  the security interest granted under this Agreement or any Loan
Document or the Guarantee given by any other Guarantor;




<PAGE>   38


(b) any defense (other than payment), set-off or counterclaim that may at
any time be available to the Borrowers or any other Guarantor against, and any
right of setoff at any time held by, the Lenders; or

(c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or
knowledge of any Guarantor or any Borrower), whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing, that constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an
equitable or legal discharge of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor, in
bankruptcy or in any other instance.

Any payment by any Borrower or any Guarantor or other circumstance that
operates to toll any statute of limitations applicable to such Persons shall
also operate to toll the statute of limitations applicable to each Guarantor.

8.03. Authorization.  Each Guarantor authorizes the Lenders, without
notice to or further assent by such Guarantor, and without affecting any
Guarantor's liability hereunder (regardless of whether any subrogation or
similar right that such Guarantor may have or any other right or remedy of such
Guarantor is extinguished or impaired), from time to time to do any or all of
the following:

(a) permit the Borrowers to increase or create Obligations, or terminate,
release, compromise, subordinate, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the
amount or time, manner or place of payment of, or rescind any demand for
payment or acceleration of, the Obligations or any part thereof, consent or
enter into supplemental loan agreements or otherwise amend the terms and
conditions of the Loan Documents or any provision thereof;

(b) take and hold Collateral from the Borrowers or any other Person,
perfect or refrain from perfecting a Lien on such Collateral, and exchange,
enforce, subordinate, release (whether intentionally or unintentionally), or
take or fail to take any other action in respect of, any such Collateral or
Lien or any part thereof;

(c) exercise in such manner and order as they elect in their sole
discretion, fail to exercise, waive, suspend, terminate or suffer expiration
of, any of the remedies or rights of the Lenders against the Borrowers or any
Guarantor in respect of any Obligation or any Collateral;

(d) release, add or settle with any Guarantor or any Borrower in respect
of the Guarantee or the Obligations;

(e) accept partial payments on the Obligations and apply any and all
payments or recoveries from any Guarantor or any Borrower or Collateral to such
of the Obligations as Lenders may elect in their sole discretion, whether or
not such Obligations are secured or guaranteed;

(f) refund at any time, at Lenders' sole discretion, any payments or
recoveries received by Lenders in respect of any Obligations or Collateral; and




<PAGE>   39


(g) otherwise deal with any Borrower, any Guarantor and any Collateral as
Lenders may elect in their sole discretion.

8.04. Right to Demand Full Performance.  In the event of any demand for
payment or performance by Lenders from any Guarantor hereunder, Lenders shall
have the right to demand their full claims and to receive all dividends or
other payments in respect thereof until the Obligations have been paid in full,
and the Guarantors shall continue to be jointly and severally liable hereunder
for any balance which may be owing to Lenders by the Borrowers under this
Agreement, the Term Notes or any other Loan Document.  The retention by the
Lenders of any security, prior to the realization by the Lenders of their
rights to such security upon foreclosure thereon, shall not, as between the
Lenders and any Guarantor, be considered as a purchase of such security, or as
payment, satisfaction or reduction of the Obligations due to the Lenders by the
Borrowers or any part thereof.  Without limiting Section 9.05 or any other
provision of this Agreement, each Guarantor, promptly after demand, will
reimburse the Lenders for all costs and expenses of collecting such amount
under, or enforcing this Guarantee, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel.

8.05. Certain Waivers.  Each Guarantor waives:

(a) the right to require the Lenders to proceed against the Borrowers or
any other Guarantor, to proceed against or exhaust any Collateral or to pursue
any other remedy in Lenders' power whatsoever and the right to have the
property of any Borrower or any other Guarantor first applied to the discharge
of the Obligations;

(b) all rights and benefits under applicable law purporting to reduce a
guarantor's obligations in proportion to the obligation of the principal or
providing that the obligation of a surety or guarantor must neither be larger
nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal;

(c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Obligations or
any Guarantor's liability hereunder;

(d) any requirement of marshaling or any other principle of election of
remedies;

(e) any right to assert against the Lenders any defense (legal or
equitable), set-off, counterclaim and other right that any Guarantor may now or
any time hereafter have against any Borrower or any other Guarantor;

(f) presentment, demand for payment or performance (including diligence in
making demands hereunder), notice of dishonor or nonperformance, protest,
acceptance and notice of acceptance of this Guarantee, and, except to the
extent expressly required by the Loan Documents, all other notices of any kind,
including (i) notice of any action taken or omitted by the Lenders in reliance
hereon, (ii) notice of any default by the Borrowers or any



<PAGE>   40

other Guarantor, (iii) notice that any portion of the Obligations is due, (iv)
notice of any action against the Borrowers or any other Guarantor, or any
enforcement of other action with respect to any Collateral, or the assertion of
any right of the Lenders hereunder; and

(g) all defenses that at any time may be available to any Guarantor by
virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium or other law now or hereafter in
effect.

8.06. The Guarantors Remain Obligated in Event the Borrowers Are No Longer
Obligated to Discharge Obligations.  It is the express intention of the Lenders
and the Guarantors that if for any reason any Borrower has no legal existence,
is or becomes under no legal obligation to discharge the Obligations owing to
the Lenders by the Borrowers or if any of the Obligations owing by the
Borrowers to the Lenders becomes irrecoverable from any Borrower by operation
of law or for any reason whatsoever, this Guarantee and the covenants,
agreements and obligations of the Guarantors contained in this Article VIII
shall nevertheless be binding upon the Guarantors, as principal debtor, until
such time as all such Obligations have been paid in full in cash to the Lenders
and all Obligations owing to the Lenders by the Borrowers have been discharged,
and the Guarantors shall be responsible for the payment thereof to the Lenders
upon demand.

8.07. Severability of Void Obligations under Guarantee.  The obligations
of any Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that would
not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of
the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law.

8.08. Guarantee Is in Addition to Other Security.  This Guarantee shall be
in addition to and not in substitution for any other guarantees or other
security which the Lenders may now or hereafter hold in respect of the
Obligations owing to the Lenders by the Borrowers and (except as may be
required by law) the Lenders shall be under no obligation to marshal in favor
of each of the Guarantors any other guarantees or other security or any moneys
or other assets which the Lenders may be entitled to receive or upon which any
Lender may have a claim.

8.09. Release of Security Interest.  Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby consents and agrees, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, that the rights of the Lenders hereunder, and the
liability of the Guarantors hereunder, shall not be affected by any and all
releases for any purpose of any Collateral from the security interest created
by any Loan Document and that this Guarantee shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Lender upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

8.10. No Bar to Further Actions.  Except as provided by law, no action or
proceeding brought or instituted under this Article VIII and the Guarantee and
no recovery or



<PAGE>   41

judgment in pursuance thereof shall be a bar or defense to any further action or
proceeding which may be brought under this Article VIII and the Guarantee by
reason of any further default or defaults under this Article VIII and the
Guarantee or in the payment of any of the Obligations owing by the Borrowers.

8.11. Failure to Exercise Rights Shall Not Operate as a Waiver; No
Suspension of Remedies.

(a) No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the
Lenders, any right, power, privilege or remedy under this Article VIII and the
Guarantee shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any rights, power, privilege or remedy preclude any other or
further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other rights, powers,
privileges or remedies.  The rights and remedies herein provided for are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided in law or
equity.

(b) Nothing contained in this Article VIII shall limit the right of the
Lenders to take any action to accelerate the maturity of the Obligations
pursuant to Article VII and as set forth in this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents or to pursue any rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder or under
applicable law.

8.12. Lenders' Duties; Notice to Lenders.

(a) Any provision in this Article VIII or elsewhere in this Agreement or
any other Loan Document allowing the Lenders to request any information or to
take any action authorized by, or on behalf of any Guarantor, shall be
permissive and shall not be obligatory on the Lenders.

(b) The Lenders shall not be required to inquire into the existence,
powers or capacities of any Borrower, any Guarantor or the officers, directors
or agents acting or purporting to act on their respective behalf.

8.13. Successors and Assigns.  All terms, agreements and conditions of
this Article VIII shall extend to and be binding upon each Guarantor and its
successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of and may be
enforced by the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns.

8.14. Release of Guarantee.  Concurrently with the payment in full in cash
of all of the Obligations, the Guarantors shall be released from and relieved
of their obligations under this Article VIII.  If any of the Obligations are
revived and reinstated after the termination of this Guarantee, then all of the
obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee shall be revived and
reinstated as if this Guarantee had not been terminated until such time as the
Obligations are paid in full, in cash, and each Guarantor shall enter into an
amendment to this Guarantee, reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders, evidencing
such revival and reinstatement.




<PAGE>   42


8.15. Execution of Guarantee.  To evidence the Guarantee, each Guarantor
hereby agrees to execute a notation relating to the Guarantee to be endorsed on
each Term Note. Each Guarantor agrees that this Agreement shall be executed on
behalf of each Guarantor by its Chairman of the Board, its President, its Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or one of its Vice Presidents, under
its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its
Assistant Secretaries.

8.16. No Subrogation; Certain Agreements.

(a) EACH GUARANTOR WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION, INDEMNITY OR
REIMBURSEMENT, AND ANY AND ALL BENEFITS OF AND RIGHTS TO ENFORCE ANY POWER,
RIGHT OR REMEDY THAT THE LENDERS MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE IN RESPECT OF THE
OBLIGATIONS AGAINST THE BORROWERS OR ANY OTHER GUARANTOR, ANY AND ALL BENEFITS
OF AND RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY COLLATERAL, WHETHER REAL OR PERSONAL
PROPERTY, NOW OR HEREAFTER HELD BY THE LENDERS, AND ANY AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS
AND CLAIMS (AS DEFINED IN THE BANKRUPTCY CODE) ANY GUARANTOR MAY HAVE AGAINST
ANY BORROWER OR ANY OTHER GUARANTOR, UNDER APPLICABLE LAW OR OTHERWISE, AT LAW
OR IN EQUITY, BY REASON OF ANY PAYMENT UNDER THE GUARANTEE, UNLESS AND UNTIL
THE OBLIGATIONS SHALL HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL IN CASH.

(b) Each Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping itself
informed of the financial condition of each other Guarantor and of all other
circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations or the
Guarantee of any other Guarantor that diligent inquiry would reveal, and agrees
that the Lenders shall have no duty to advise any Guarantor of information
regarding such condition or any such circumstances.

8.17. Bankruptcy; No Discharge.  (a) Without limiting Section 8.02 or any
other provision of this Article VIII, the Guarantee shall not be discharged or
otherwise affected by any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding
commenced by or against any Borrower or any other Guarantor, including (i) any
discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any part of the
Obligations in or as a result of any such proceeding, whether or not assented
to by the Lenders, (ii) any disallowance of all or any portion of any claim for
repayment of the Obligations, (iii) any use of cash or other collateral in any
such proceeding, (iv) any agreement or stipulation as to adequate protection in
any such proceeding, (v) any failure by any Lender to file or enforce a claim
against any Borrower or any other Guarantor or its estate in any bankruptcy or
reorganization case, (vi) any amendment, modification, stay or cure of any
Lender's rights that may occur in any such proceeding, (vii) any election by
any Lender under Section 1112(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, or (viii) any
borrowing or grant of a Lien under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Each
Guarantor understands and acknowledges that by virtue of this Guarantee, it has
specifically assumed any and all risks of any such proceeding with respect to
the Borrowers and each other Guarantor.





<PAGE>   43

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Article VIII to the contrary, any
Event of Default under Section 7.01(f) or (g) of this Agreement shall render
all Obligations automatically due and payable for purposes of the Guarantee,
without demand on the part of the Lenders.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the
Guarantee (and any Lien on the Collateral securing the Guarantee or the
Obligations) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment, or any part thereof, of any or all of the
Obligations is rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential or otherwise required to be restored or returned by any Lender in
connection with any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving
any Borrower, any other Guarantor or otherwise, if the proceeds of any
Collateral are required to be returned by any Lender under any such
circumstances, or if any Lender elects to return any such payment or proceeds
or any part thereof in its sole discretion, all as though such payment had not
been made or such proceeds not been received.

of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.05 hereof) or of
any of the Term Notes or consent to any departure by the Borrowers and
Guarantors therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written
concurrence of the Lenders, which the Lenders shall have the right to grant or
withhold at their sole discretion.  Any waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was
given.  No notice to or demand on the Borrowers or the Guarantors in any case
shall entitle the Borrowers or Guarantors to any other or further notice or
demand in similar or other circumstances.

9.03. No Implied Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No course of dealing and no
delay or failure of the Lenders in exercising any right, power or privilege
under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document shall affect any
other or future exercise thereof or exercise of any other right, power or
privilege; nor shall any single or partial



<PAGE>   44

exercise of any such right, power or privilege or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right, power or privilege preclude any
further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights
and remedies of the Lenders under this Agreement, the Term Notes and the other
Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which
the Lenders have hereunder or thereunder or at law or in equity or otherwise.
The Lenders may exercise their rights and remedies against the Borrowers, the
Guarantors and the Collateral as the Lenders may elect, and regardless of the
existence or adequacy of any other right or remedy.

9.04. Notices.

(a) Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices, requests, demands,
directions and other communications (collectively "notices") under the
provisions of this Agreement, the Term Notes or any other Loan Document shall
be in writing and shall be mailed (by certified mail, postage prepaid and
return receipt requested), telecopied, or delivered and shall be effective (i)
if mailed, three days after being deposited in the mails, (ii) if telecopied,
when sent, confirmation received and (iii) if delivered, upon delivery.  All
notices shall be sent to the applicable party at the address stated on the
signature page hereof or in accordance with the last unrevoked written
direction from such party to the other parties hereto.

(b) Without limiting Section 9.06 or any other provision of this
Agreement, the Lenders may rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, on
any notice purportedly made by or on behalf of the Borrowers or the Guarantors
and the Lenders shall have no duty to verify the identity or authority of any
Person giving such notice.  The preceding sentence shall apply to all notices
whether or not made in a manner authorized or required by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document.

9.05. Expenses; Taxes; Attorneys' Fees; Indemnification.  The Borrowers
agree to pay or cause to be paid, on demand, and to save the Lenders harmless
against liability for the payment of, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
regardless of whether the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
including but not limited to reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
Lenders, accounting, due diligence, periodic field audits, investigation,
monitoring of assets, miscellaneous disbursements, examination, travel, lodging
and meals, incurred by the Lenders from time to time arising from or relating
to:  (a) the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, performance and
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (b) any
requested amendments, waivers or consents to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents whether or not such documents become effective or are given, (c) the
preservation and protection of any of the Lenders' rights under this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents, (d) the defense of any claim or action asserted or
brought against any Lender by any Person that arises from or relates to this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, such Lender's claims against the Borrowers
or the Guarantors, or any and all matters in connection therewith, (e) the
commencement or defense of, or intervention in, any court proceeding arising
from or related to this Agreement or any



<PAGE>   45

other Loan Document, (f) the filing of any petition, complaint, answer, motion
or other pleading by any Lender, or the taking of any action in respect of the
Collateral or other security, in connection with this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, (g) the protection, collection, lease, sale, taking possession of
or liquidation of, any Collateral or other security in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, (h) any attempt to enforce any lien or
security interest in any Collateral or other security in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, (i) any attempt to collect from the
Borrowers or the Guarantors, (j) the receipt of any advice with respect to any
of the foregoing, (k) all Environmental Liabilities and Costs arising from or in
connection with the past, present or future operations of any of the Borrowers
or any of the Guarantors involving any damage to real or personal property or
natural resources or harm or injury alleged to have resulted from any Release of
Hazardous Materials on, upon or into such property, (l) any costs or liabilities
incurred in connection with the investigation, removal, cleanup and/or
remediation of any Hazardous Materials present or arising out of the operations
of any facility of the Borrowers, the Guarantors or their respective
Subsidiaries, or (m) any costs or liabilities incurred in connection with any
Environmental Lien.  Without limitation of the foregoing or any other provision
of any Loan Document:  (x) the Borrowers agree to pay all stamp, document,
transfer, recording or filing taxes or fees (including, without limitation,
mortgage recording taxes) and similar impositions now or hereafter determined by
the Lenders to be payable in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and the Borrowers agree to indemnify and hold the Lenders harmless
from and against any and all present or future claims, liabilities or losses
with respect to or resulting from any omission to pay or delay in paying any
such taxes, fees or impositions, and (y) if the Borrowers or the Guarantors fail
to perform any covenant or agreement contained herein or in any other Loan
Document, any Lender may itself perform or cause performance of such covenant or
agreement, and the expenses of such Lender incurred in connection therewith
shall be reimbursed on demand by the Borrowers.  The Borrowers agree to
indemnify and defend the Lenders and their directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, partners, shareholders, counsel and agents and any affiliate of any
of the foregoing (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from, and hold each
of them harmless against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages,
costs or expenses of any nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, fees,
expenses and disbursements of counsel and amounts paid in settlement) incurred
by, imposed upon or asserted against any of them arising out of or by reason of
any investigation, litigation or other proceeding brought or threatened relating
to, or otherwise arising out of or relating to, the execution of this Agreement,
the Letter Agreement or any other Loan Document, the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or any Loan or proposed Loan hereunder (including, but without
limitation, any use made or proposed to be made by the Borrowers, the Guarantors
or any of their Affiliates of the proceeds of any thereof, or the delivery or
use or transfer of or the payment or failure to pay under any Loan) but
excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs or expenses to
the extent finally judicially determined, by a final and non-appealable order of
a court of competent jurisdiction, to have directly resulted directly from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Party.





<PAGE>   46

9.06. Several and Not Joint; Limited Liability.  (a) Notwithstanding
anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, or any document
or instrument executed and delivered in connection herewith, the parties hereto
agree that the obligations, liabilities and indemnities of each Lender
hereunder shall be several and not joint, and no Lender shall have any
liability hereunder for any breach by any other Lender of any obligation of
such Lender set forth herein or in any other Loan Document.

(b) The Borrowers and Guarantors hereby acknowledge and agree that neither
this Agreement nor any other Loan Document is being executed on behalf of the
partners of any Lender that is a limited partnership as individuals and the
obligations of this Agreement are not binding upon any of the partners,
officers, employees or beneficiaries of such Lender individually but are
binding only upon the assets and property of such Lender, and the Borrowers and
Guarantors agrees that no beneficiary, partner, employee or officer of such
Lender may be held personally liable or responsible for any obligations of such
Lender arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  With respect
to obligations of each Lender arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, the Borrowers and Guarantors shall look for payment or satisfaction
of any claim solely to the assets and property of such Lender.

(c) Magten represents and warrants to the Borrowers and Guarantors that it
has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
other Loan Document as agent or as general partner, as applicable, for the
Lenders on whose behalf Magten is executing this Agreement as set forth on the
signature pages hereto.  Except for the foregoing representations and
warranties, the Borrowers and Guarantors hereby acknowledge and agree that
Magten shall not have any personal obligation or liability to the Borrowers and
Guarantors under this Agreement or any other Loan Document but that it is
acting solely for and on behalf of the aforementioned Lenders, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrowers and Guarantors shall
have no recourse against Magten for the performance or satisfaction of any
obligation under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, but shall look for
payment or satisfaction of any claim arising under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document solely to the assets and properties of the Lenders.

9.07. Application.  Except to the extent, if any, expressly set forth in
this Agreement or in the Loan Documents, each Lender shall have the right to
apply any payment received or applied by it in connection with the Obligations
to such of the Obligations then due and payable as it may elect.

9.08. Severability.  The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be
severable.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction such provision shall, as
to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability
thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any
jurisdiction.





<PAGE>   47

9.09. Governing Law.  This Agreement and the Term Notes shall be deemed to
be contracts under the laws of the State of New York, without regard to choice
of law principles, and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of said State.

9.10. Prior Understandings.  This Agreement supersedes all prior
understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, among the parties
hereto relating to the transactions provided for herein, other than the Interim
Order and the Final Order.

9.11. Duration; Survival.  All representations and warranties of the
Borrowers and Guarantors contained herein or made in connection herewith shall
survive the making of the Loans and shall not be waived by the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Term Notes or any other Loan Document, any
investigation by or knowledge of the Lenders, the making of any Loan hereunder,
or any other event whatsoever.  All covenants and agreements of the Borrowers
and the Guarantors contained herein shall continue in full force and effect
from and after the date hereof so long as the Borrowers may borrow hereunder
and until the Obligations have been paid in full in cash.  Without limitation,
it is understood that all obligations of the Borrowers and the Guarantors to
make payments to or indemnify the Lenders (including, without limitation,
obligations arising under Section 9.05 hereof) shall survive the payment in
full of the Term Notes and all Obligations and of all other obligations of the
Borrowers and the Guarantors thereunder and hereunder, termination of this
Agreement and all other events whatsoever and whether or not any Loans are made
hereunder.

9.12. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts each
of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

9.13. Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns except that the Borrowers and the Guarantors
may not assign or transfer any of their rights hereunder or thereunder without
the prior written consent of the Lenders.

9.14. Waiver of Jury Trial.  BY ITS EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE BORROWERS AND THE GUARANTORS, AND THE LENDERS HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT, THE TERM NOTES OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT, ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR ANY COURSE
OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR
ACTIONS OF THE LENDERS OR ANY



<PAGE>   48

BORROWER OR GUARANTOR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH.  THIS PROVISION IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH PARTY HERETO TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

9.15. Right of Setoff.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
any Event of Default, each Lender may, and is hereby authorized to, at any time
from time to time, without notice to the Borrowers or the Guarantors (any such
notice being expressly waived by the Borrowers and the Guarantors) and to the
fullest extent permitted by law, set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provision or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrowers and the Guarantors against any and all Obligations of
the Borrowers or the Guarantors now or hereafter existing under the Loan
Documents, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any
demand hereunder or thereunder and although such Obligations may be contingent
or unmatured.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers and the
Guarantors after any such setoff and application made by such Lender; provided,
however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such setoff and application.  The rights of the Lenders under this Section 9.15
are in addition to the other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of setoff under applicable law or otherwise) which the
Lenders may have.

9.16. Headings.  Section headings herein are included for convenience of
reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other
purpose.

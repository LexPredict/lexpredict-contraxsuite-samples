not to exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in aggregate principal amount at
any one time outstanding. Advances under this Section 2 shall be evidenced by
the Revolving Credit Note under which advances, repayments and readvances may be
made, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2.2 The Revolving Credit Note shall mature on the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date and each Advance from time to time outstanding thereunder shall
bear interest at its Applicable Interest Rate. The amount and date of each
Advance, its Applicable Interest Rate, its Interest Period, and the amount and
date of any repayment shall be noted on Bank's records, which records will be
presumed correct absent manifest error. The Applicable Margins shall initially
be 3.25% for Eurodollar-based Advances and



12

.50% for Prime-based Advances. Adjustments to the Applicable Margin based on the
Funded Debt Ratio shall be implemented as follows:

(a)      Such Applicable Margin adjustments shall be given
prospective effect only on a semi-annual basis,
effective (i) on the first Business Day of the month
following delivery of Company's annual financial
statements and compliance certificate and (ii) on the
first Business Day of the month following delivery of
Company's quarterly financial statements and
compliance certificate for the second fiscal quarter
as to any Prime-based Advance, and as to any
Eurodollar-based Advance, effective upon the
expiration of the applicable Interest Period(s), if
any, in effect on the first Business Day of the month
following the date of delivery of such financial
statements and compliance certificate, as the case
may be, establishing applicability of the appropriate
adjustments, with no retroactivity or claw-back
(provided, however, that if Company fails to timely
deliver such financial statements and compliance
certificate, the Applicable Margins shall be 3.25% or
3.50%, as applicable, for Eurodollar-based Advances
and 0.50% or .75%, as applicable, for Prime-based
Advances for the number of days such financial
statements and certificate were not delivered within
the applicable time period specified in Section 11.1,
commencing on the first Business Day after the latest
due date for such financial statements and
certificate and continuing until the first Business
Day after delivery of such financial statements and
certificate;

(b)      An adjustment hereunder, after becoming effective,
shall remain in effect only through the end of the
applicable Interest Period(s) in effect on the
delivery of subsequent financial statements and
certificates, as aforesaid, demonstrating any change
in such Funded Debt Ratio or the occurrence of any
event which under the terms hereof causes such
adjustment no longer to be applicable; and any such
subsequent adjustment or no adjustment, as the case
may be, shall apply (and said pricing shall thereby
be adjusted up or down, as applicable), effective
with the commencement of the Interest Period
immediately following such change or event; and

(c)      Such Applicable Margin adjustments under this Section
2.2 shall be made irrespective of, and in addition
to, any other interest rate adjustments hereunder.

<PAGE>

2.3 Company may request an Advance under this Section 2 upon the
delivery to Bank of a Request for Advance executed by an authorized officer of
Company, subject to the following:

(a)      each such Request for Advance shall set forth the information
required on the Request for Advance form annexed hereto as
Exhibit "B";

(b)      each such Request for Advance shall be delivered to Bank by
11:00 a.m. (Detroit, Michigan time) on the day of the proposed
date of Advance;

(c)      the principal amount of such Advance, plus the amount of any
outstanding indebtedness to be then combined therewith having
the same Applicable Interest Rate and Interest Period, if any,
shall be, in the case of a Eurodollar-based Advance, at least
$250,000 or any larger amount in $100,000 increments; and

(d)      a Request for Advance, once delivered to Bank, shall not be
revocable by Company after Bank has funded or committed in
accordance with Bank's internal procedures to fund the
applicable Advance.

Bank may, at its option, lend under this Section 2 upon Company's
telephone or facsimile request upon execution by Company of a Borrower's
Telephone and Facsimile Authorization in the form of Exhibit "E" attached
hereto.

2.4 The aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under
the Revolving Credit Note plus the Letter of Credit Reserve and the Facility
Reserve shall never exceed the Borrowing Base. Company shall immediately make
all payments necessary to comply with this provision.

2.5 Letters of Credit and proceeds of Advances under the Revolving
Credit Note shall be used solely for (a) general corporate and working capital
purposes and (b) investments permitted by Section 11.6 hereof.

2.6 Company shall pay to Bank a non-refundable revolving credit
commitment fee on the daily average amount by which $10,000,000 exceeds the
aggregate amount of Advances outstanding from time to time. The revolving credit
commitment fee shall initially be .50% equal to the amount of such excess times
the Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage computed on a daily basis. The
revolving credit commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the
first day of each January, April, July and October, commencing January 1, 2002,
and at the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, and shall be computed on the basis of
a year of 360 days and assessed for the actual number of day elapsed. The
revolving credit commitment fee shall initially be .50% per annum. Adjustments
thereto shall be given prospective effect, effective on delivery of the
financial statements and compliance certificate referred to in Section 2.2(a)
establishing applicability of the appropriate adjustments, with no retroactivity
or claw-back; provided,



14
<PAGE>

that if Company fails to timely deliver such financial certificate, the
revolving credit commitment fee shall be .625% per annum for the number of days
such financial statements and certificate was not timely delivered, commencing
on the first day of such next fiscal quarter. For purposes of calculating the
revolving credit commitment fee, the face amount of outstanding Letters of
Credit shall be considered to be outstanding Advances.

2.7 In addition to Advances under the Revolving Credit Note to be
provided to Company by Bank under and pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Agreement,
Bank further agrees to issue, or commit to issue, from time to time, standby
Letters of Credit for the account of Company in aggregate undrawn amounts not to
exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) at any one time outstanding; provided,
however, that the sum of the aggregate amount of Advances outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Note plus the Letter of Credit Reserve shall not exceed the
lesser of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) or the Borrowing Base at any time;
provided further, that except as described in the following proviso, no Letter
of Credit shall, by its terms, have an expiration date which extends beyond the
earlier to occur of one year after issuance or the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date; and provided further, that in the event any Letter of Credit has an
expiration date later than the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, Company shall
deliver to Bank on demand cash collateral in an amount equal to the maximum
undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit. In addition to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the issuance of any Letters of Credit shall also be subject
to the terms and conditions of any letter of credit applications and agreements
executed and delivered by Company to Bank with respect thereto. Company shall
pay to Bank annually in advance a fee of two percent (2%) per annum of the
amount of each Letter of Credit.

3. MARGIN REDUCTION OPTION

3.1 Margin Reduction Option. (a) From time to time and at any time
during which no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing,

6. INTEREST, INTEREST PERIODS, CONVERSIONS, PREPAYMENTS.

6.1 Interest. Advances under the Revolving Credit Note shall bear
interest from the date thereof on the unpaid principal balance thereof from time
to time outstanding, at a rate per annum equal to the Prime-based Rate or the
Eurodollar-based Rate, as the Company may elect subject to the provisions of
this Agreement. With respect to Prime-based Advances, interest shall be payable
monthly on the first day of each month, commencing on the first day of the month
following the month during which such Advance is made, and at maturity. With
respect to Eurodollar-based Advances, interest shall be payable on the last day
of each Interest Period applicable thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from
and after the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Advances shall bear
interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to: (i) in the case of
Prime-based Advances, three percent (3%) above the Prime-based Rate; and (ii) in
the case of a Eurodollar-based Advance, three percent (3%) above the rate which
would otherwise be applicable under this Section 6.1 until the end of the then
current Interest Period, at which time such Advance shall bear interest at the
rate provided for in clause (i) of this Section 6.1. Interest on all Advances
shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days
elapsed. The interest rate with respect to any Prime-based Advance shall change
on the effective date of any change in the Prime-based Rate.

6.2 Interest Periods. Each Interest Period for a Eurodollar-based
Advance shall commence on the date such Eurodollar-based Advance is made or is
converted from an Advance of another type pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof or on
the last day of the immediately preceding Interest Period for such
Eurodollar-based Advance, and shall end on the date one, two, or three months
thereafter, as the Company may elect as set forth below, subject to the
following:

(i) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date; and

(ii) any Interest Period which would otherwise end on a day which
is not a Business Day shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day unless the next succeeding Business Day falls in another calendar
month, in which case such Interest Period shall end on the immediately
preceding Business Day and when an Interest Period begins on a day
which has no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month during
which such Interest Period is to end, it shall end on the last Business
Day of such calendar month.

The Company shall elect the initial Interest Period applicable to a
Eurodollar-based Advance by its Request for Advance given to the Bank pursuant
to Section 2.3 or by its



16
<PAGE>

notice of conversion given to the Bank pursuant to Section 6.3, as the case may
be. Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Company may elect to continue an Advance as a Eurodollar-based Advance by giving
irrevocable written, telephonic or telegraphic notice thereof to the Bank, not
later than 11:00 a.m. (Detroit, Michigan time) on the last day of the then
current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar-based Advance, specifying
the duration of the succeeding Interest Period therefor. If the Bank does not
receive timely notice of the election and the Interest Period elected by the
Company, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to convert such
Eurodollar-based Advance to a Prime-based Advance at the end of the then current
Interest Period.

6.3 Conversion of Advances. Provided that no Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Company may, on any Business Day, convert
any outstanding Advance into an Advance of another type in the same aggregate
principal amount, provided that any conversion of a Eurodollar-based Advance
shall be made only on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period
applicable to such Advance. If the Company desires to convert an Advance, it
shall give the Bank telephonic or telegraphic notice by 11:00 a.m. (Detroit,
Michigan time) on the proposed date of conversion, specifying the date of such
conversion, the Advances to be converted, the type of Advance elected and, if
the conversion is into a Eurodollar-based Advance, the duration of the first
Interest Period therefor.

6.4 Prepayments. Company may prepay all or part of the outstanding
balance of the Prime-based Advance(s) under the Revolving Credit Note at any
time without premium or penalty. Upon three (3) Business Days prior notice to
Bank, Company may prepay all or part of any Eurodollar-based Advance, provided
that the amount of any such partial prepayment shall be at least $250,000 and
the unpaid portion of such Advance which is refunded or converted under Section
6.3 shall be subject to the limitations of Section 2.3(c). Any prepayment of a
Prime-based Advance or any prepayment of a Eurodollar-based Advance on the last
day of the Interest Period therefor made in accordance with this Section shall
be without premium, penalty or prejudice to Company's right to reborrow under
the terms of this Agreement. Any other prepayment shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 7.1 hereof.

7. SPECIAL PROVISIONS, CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES AND YIELD PROTECTION.

7.1 If Company makes any payment of principal with respect to any
Eurodollar-based Advance on any day other than the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto (whether voluntarily, by acceleration, or otherwise),
or if Company fails to borrow any Eurodollar-based Advance after notice has been
given by Company to Bank in accordance with the terms hereof requesting such
Advance, or if Company fails to make any payment of principal or interest when
due in respect of a Eurodollar-based Advance, Company shall reimburse Bank on
demand for any resulting loss, cost or expense incurred by Bank as a result
thereof, including, without limitation, any such loss, cost or expense incurred
in obtaining, liquidating, employing or redeploying deposits from third parties,
whether or not Bank shall have funded or committed to fund such Advance. Such
amount payable by Company to Bank may include, without limitation, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, refunded or converted, for
the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, refund
or convert, through the last day of the relevant Interest Period, at the
applicable rate of interest for said Advance(s) provided under this Agreement,
over (b) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by Bank) which would
have accrued to Bank on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a
comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.
Calculation of any amounts payable to Bank under this paragraph shall be made as
though Bank shall have actually funded or committed to fund the relevant
Eurodollar-based Advance through the purchase of an underlying deposit in an
amount equal to the amount of such Advance and having a maturity comparable to
the relevant Interest Period; provided, however, that Bank may fund any
Eurodollar-based Advance in any manner it deems fit and the foregoing
assumptions shall be utilized only for the purpose of the calculation of amounts
payable under this paragraph. Upon the written request of Company, Bank shall
deliver to Company a certificate setting forth the basis for determining such
losses, costs and expenses, which certificate shall be conclusively presumed
correct, absent manifest error.

7.2 For any Interest Period for which the Applicable Interest Rate is
the Eurodollar-based Rate, if Bank shall designate a Eurodollar Lending Office
which maintains books separate from those of the rest of Bank, Bank shall have
the option of maintaining and carrying the relevant Advance on the books of such
Eurodollar Lending Office.

7.3 If with respect to any Interest Period Bank determines that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the foreign exchange and interbank markets
generally, deposits in Eurodollars in the applicable amounts are not being
offered to the Bank for such Interest Period, then Bank shall forthwith give
notice thereof to the Company. Thereafter, until Bank notifies Company that such
circumstances no longer exist, the



18
<PAGE>

obligation of Bank to make Eurodollar-based Advances, and the right of Company
to elect the Eurodollar-based Rate for any Advance, shall be suspended.

7.4 If, after the date hereof, the introduction or implementation of,
or any change in, any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Bank (or its
Eurodollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, shall make it unlawful or impossible
for the Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) to honor its obligations
hereunder to make or maintain any Advance with interest at the Eurodollar-based
Rate, Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to Company. Thereafter (a) the
obligation of Bank to make Eurodollar-based Advances and the right of Company to
elect the Eurodollar-based Rate for any Advance shall be suspended and
thereafter Company may select as Applicable Interest Rates only those which
remain available, and (b) if Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain an
Advance at the Eurodollar-based Rate to the end of the then current Interest
Period applicable thereto, the Prime-based Rate shall be the Applicable Interest
Rate for the remainder of such Interest Period.

7.5 If the adoption or implementation after the date hereof of, or any
change after the date hereof in, any applicable law, rule or regulation of any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Bank (or its
Eurodollar Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) made by any such authority, central bank or comparable agency
after the date hereof:

(a)      shall subject Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) to any
tax, duty or other charge with respect to any Advance or the
Revolving Credit Note or shall change the basis of taxation of
payments to Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) of the
principal of or interest on any Advance or the Revolving
Credit Notes or any other amounts due under this Agreement in
respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on the
overall net income of Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office
imposed by any jurisdiction in which Bank is organized or
engaged in business); or

(b)      shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
(including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by Bank (or its Eurodollar
Lending Office) or shall impose on Bank (or its Eurodollar
Lending Office) or the foreign exchange and interbank markets
any other condition affecting any Advance or the Revolving
Credit Note;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the costs to Bank of
maintaining any part of the Indebtedness or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by



19
<PAGE>

Bank under this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Note, by an amount deemed by
the Bank to be material, then, within fifteen days after demand by Bank, Company
agrees to pay to Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Bank
for such increased cost or reduction. A certificate of Bank setting forth the
basis for determining such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate
Bank shall be presumed to be correct save for manifest error.

7.6 In the event that at any time after the date of this Agreement any
change in law such as described in Section 7.5 hereof shall, in the opinion of
Bank, require that the credit provided under this Agreement be treated as an
asset or otherwise be included for purposes of calculating the appropriate
amount of capital to be maintained by Bank or any corporation controlling Bank
and such change has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
Bank's or Bank's parent's capital or assets as a consequence of the Bank's
obligations hereunder to a level below that which Bank or Bank's parent would
have achieved but for such change, then Bank shall notify Company and demand
compensation therefor and, within fifteen days after demand by Bank, Company
agrees to pay to Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Bank
for such reduction. A certificate of Bank setting forth the basis for
determining such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate Bank shall
be presumed to be correct save for manifest error.

8. CONDITIONS; SECURITY

this Agreement, in form and substance to be satisfactory to Bank, with (i)

past, present and future officers, directors, shareholders, employees,
representatives and consultants harmless from any and all loss, damages, suits,
penalties, costs, liabilities and expenses (including but not limited to

out of any claim, loss or damage of any property, injuries to or death of
persons, contamination of or adverse affects on the environment, or any
violation of any applicable Environmental Laws, caused by or in any way related
to any property owned or operated by Company or any Subsidiary, or due to any
acts of Company or any Subsidiary or such person's, officers, directors,
shareholders, employees, consultants and/or representatives; provided, however,
that the foregoing indemnification shall not be applicable when arising from
events or conditions occurring while the Bank is in sole possession (subject to
the rights of any creditors of Company) of such property. In no event shall
Company be liable hereunder for any loss, damages, suits, penalties, costs,
liabilities or expenses arising from any act of gross negligence of Bank, or its

directors, shareholders, employees, consultants and representatives from any
claims that may arise by reason of the security interest, liens and/or mortgages
granted to Bank, or under any other document or agreement given to secure
repayment of any indebtedness from Company, whether or not such claims arise
before or after Bank has foreclosed upon and/or otherwise become the owner of
any such property. All obligations of indemnity as provided hereunder shall be
secured by the Collateral Documents until payment in full of all indebtedness of
Company to Bank, unless there is a then known violation of the Environmental
Laws and Bank has asserted in writing a claim for indemnification from Company,
in which event the same shall continue until the violation is remediated.

It is expressly agreed and understood that the provisions hereof shall
and are intended to be continuing and shall survive the repayment of any
indebtedness from Company to Bank.

consent to any departure by Company therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Bank, and then such
amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given. No amendment, waiver or consent
with respect to any provision of this Agreement shall affect any other provision
of this Agreement.

14.8 All sums payable by Company to Bank under this Agreement or the
other documents contemplated hereby shall be paid directly to Bank at its
principal office set forth in Section 14.5 hereof in immediately available
United States funds, without set off, deduction or counterclaim. Bank may charge
any and all deposit or other accounts (including without limit an account
evidenced by a certificate of deposit) of Company with Bank for all or a part of
any Indebtedness then due; provided, however, that this authorization shall not
affect Company's obligation to pay, when due, any Indebtedness whether or not
account balances are sufficient to pay amounts due.

14.9 Any payment of the Indebtedness made by mail will be deemed
tendered and received only upon actual receipt by Bank at the address designated
for such payment, whether or not Bank has authorized payment by mail or any
other manner, and shall not be deemed to have been made in a timely manner
unless received on the date due for such payment, time being of the essence.
Company expressly assumes all risks of loss or liability resulting from
non-delivery or delay of delivery of any item of payment transmitted by mail or
in any other manner. Acceptance by Bank of any payment in an amount less than
the amount then due shall be deemed an acceptance on account only, and the
failure to pay the entire amount then due shall be and continue to be an Event
of Default, and at any time thereafter and until the entire amount then due has
been paid, Bank shall be entitled to exercise any and all rights conferred upon
it herein upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. Company waives the right
to direct the application of any and all payments at any time or times hereafter
received by Bank from or on behalf of Company. Company agrees that Bank shall
have the

<PAGE>

continuing exclusive right to apply and to reapply any and all payments received
at any time or times hereafter against the Indebtedness in such manner as Bank
may deem advisable, notwithstanding any entry by Bank upon any of its books and
records. Company expressly agrees that to the extent that Bank receives any
payment or benefit and such payment or benefit, or any part thereof, is
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or is required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other party under any
bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the
extent of such payment or benefit, the Indebtedness or part thereof intended to
be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
payment or benefit had not been made and, further, any such repayment by Bank,
to the extent that Bank did not directly receive a corresponding cash payment,
shall be added to and be additional Indebtedness payable upon demand by Bank.

14.10 In the event Company's obligation to pay interest on the
principal balance of any of the Notes is or becomes in excess of the maximum
interest rate which Company is permitted by law to contract or agree to pay,
giving due consideration to the execution date of this Agreement, then, in that
event, the rate of interest applicable shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to such maximum rate and all previous payments in excess of such maximum rate
shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and not of
interest.

14.11 This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution hereof
by Bank and Company.

14.12 This Agreement constitutes an amendment and restatement of the
Prior Credit Agreement, which is fully superceded and amended and restated in
its entirety hereby; provided, however, that the Indebtedness governed by the
Prior Credit Agreement shall remain outstanding and in full force and effect and
provided further that this Agreement does not constitute a novation of such
Indebtedness.

14.13 COMPANY AND BANK HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS AT ANY TIME IN WHICH
COMPANY AND BANK ARE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER
DOCUMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

WITNESS the due execution hereof as of the day and year first above
written.

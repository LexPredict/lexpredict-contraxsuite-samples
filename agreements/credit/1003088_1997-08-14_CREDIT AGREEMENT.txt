Agent irrevocable notice of such election, of which election Agent will
promptly notify Banks.  On the Commencement Date, each Bank shall make
available to Agent its respective Pro Rata Share of such requested LIBOR Rate
Advance no later than 12:00 noon, Seattle time, on the specified borrowing
date.  Whether or not any Bank fails to fund its Pro Rata Share of a LIBOR

shall be one week or one, two, three, or six months.  In no event shall the
Interest Period extend beyond the Termination Date.  The minimum amount of a
LIBOR Rate Advance shall be $500,000, with additional increments of $100,000
each permitted.

8.3  PREPAYMENTS.  Borrower may prepay any Base Rate Advance on any
Business Day without premium or penalty.  If Borrower prepays all or any
portion of a LIBOR Rate Advance prior to the end of an Interest Period, there
shall be due at the time of any such prepayment the Prepayment Fee,
determined in accordance with Form 51-6325, which shall be attached as
Exhibit 1 to this Agreement, and any such prepayment may only be made if in
the amount of $100,000 or more.

8.4  REVERSION TO BASE RATE.  The Revolving Loan shall bear interest at
the Base Rate unless an Adjusted LIBOR Rate is specifically selected.  At the
termination of any Interest Period, each LIBOR Rate Advance shall revert to a
Base Rate Advance unless Borrower directs otherwise pursuant to Section 2.4.

8.5  INABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN MARKET.  If Agent or any Bank in good
faith cannot participate in the Eurodollar market for legal or practical
reasons, the Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall cease to be an interest rate option.
Agent or such Bank shall notify Borrower if and when it again becomes legal
or practical to participate in the Eurodollar market, at which time the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate shall resume being an interest rate option.

8.6  COSTS.  Borrower shall, as to LIBOR Rate Advances, reimburse Agent,
for the account of Banks, for all costs, taxes, and expenses, and defend and
hold Banks harmless for any liabilities, which Banks may incur as a
consequence of any changes in the cost of participating in, or in the laws or
regulations affecting, the Eurodollar market, including any additional
reserve requirements, except to the extent such costs are already calculated
into the Adjusted LIBOR Rate.  This covenant shall survive this Agreement and
the repayment of the Revolving Loan.  Banks shall provide documentation to
Borrower detailing the basis for any charges made pursuant to this Section.


<PAGE>

8.7  BASIS OF QUOTES.  Borrower acknowledges that Agent or Banks may or
may not in any particular case actually match-fund a LIBOR Rate Advance.
Whether the mechanism for setting a particular rate in fact represents the
actual cost to Banks for any particular dollar or Eurodollar deposit or any
LIBOR Rate Advance will depend upon how such Bank actually chooses to fund
the LIBOR Rate Advance,  or any foreign exchange contract.  By electing an
Adjusted LIBOR Rate, Borrower waives any right to object to Agent's means of
calculating the Adjusted LIBOR Rate quote accepted by Borrower.

13.7 INSTRUCTIONS.  Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document as Agent
deems appropriate, unless it shall first receive the consent of Majority
Banks or shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by all Banks, in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share, against all liabilities and
expenses which may be incurred by it or by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action.  Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting
or in refraining from acting under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
in accordance with the consent of Majority Banks, where required, and such
request and any action taken or not taken to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon all of the Banks and all future holders of any interest in the
Obligations.

13.8 NOTICE OF DEFAULT.  Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default unless Agent has actual knowledge or
has received notice from one or more of the Banks or Borrower referring to
this Agreement, describing such Default and stating in substance


<PAGE>

that such notice is a "notice of default."  In the event Agent receives such
a notice or has actual knowledge of any Default, Agent shall give notice
thereof to all of the Banks.

13.9  REPRESENTATIONS.  None of Agent's Related Parties have made any
representation or warranty to Banks, and no action taken by Agent after the
date of this Agreement, including any review of Borrower's affairs, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by Agent to any of the
Banks.

13.10 INDEPENDENT CREDIT REVIEW.  Each Bank represents to Agent that it
has, independently and without reliance upon Agent, and based upon such
financial statements, documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, property,
operations, and financial condition of Borrower and Guarantor and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each of the Banks also represents
that it shall, independently and without reliance upon Agent, and based upon
such financial statements, documents, and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals, and decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, property, operations, and financial condition of
Borrower.  For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Article 9, each Bank that has executed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved, or accepted, or to be satisfied with,
each document or other matter either sent by Agent to such Bank for consent,
approval, acceptance, or satisfaction, or required under said Article to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Bank,
unless such Bank promptly provides Agent with notice to the contrary.

13.11 INFORMATION.  Agent shall have no obligation, duty, or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide Banks
with any credit or other information concerning the business, property,
operations, or financial condition of Borrower or Guarantor which may come
into possession of any of Agent's Related Parties.  Although Agent may
furnish to Banks, upon request, copies of documents Agent has received
pursuant to this Agreement, Agent assumes no responsibility as to the
authenticity, validity, or enforceability of any such documents.

13.12 INDEMNITY.  The Banks shall indemnify Agent, according to their
respective Pro Rata Share, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, suits, judgments,
reasonable costs and expenses, taxes, and disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever (except to the extent they arise from Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct) which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against any of Agent's Related Parties or in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to therein, any transaction contemplated thereby,
or any action taken or omitted by Agent under or in connection with any of
the foregoing.  Without limiting the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse
Agent, in accordance with such Bank's Pro Rata Share, for any costs or
expenses incurred by Agent subsequent to the closing of this Agreement,
including outside or in-house legal fees, which (a) are required to be
reimbursed to Agent by Borrower under any of the Loan Documents, but are not
so reimbursed, or (b) arise out of action taken by Agent at the unanimous
consent of Banks in accordance with this Agreement.  This subsection shall
survive the final payment of the Obligations and payment of all other amounts
due under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

13.13 SEPARATION OF CAPACITIES.  In its capacity as a lender that is one
of the Banks, Seafirst shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as the
other Banks and may exercise the same as though it were not Agent.  The term
"Bank(s)" shall include Seafirst, in its individual capacity as a lender and
not as an agent, unless the context otherwise indicates.  This Agreement
shall not restrict in any way any Bank's ability to enter into other credit
or banking facilities with Borrower or Guarantor, so long as such facility
(a) does not violate any other provision of this Agreement and (b) is not
secured by any of the Collateral; and the other Bank or Banks hereunder shall
not have any rights or obligations as to any such facilities not provided by
such Bank or Banks.

ARTICLE 14
EVENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAULT

14.1 EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  Any of the following events shall constitute a
default by Borrower under the terms of this Agreement, the L/C Agreements,
and all other Loan Documents ("Default"):

(a)  NONPAYMENT.  Any payment of principal or reimbursement of a draw
on a Letter of Credit is not made on the date when due, or any other
payment or reimbursement due or demanded under this Agreement or any Loan
Document is not made within five days of the date when due;

(b)  BREACH OF WARRANTY.  Any material representation or warranty made
or deemed made in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or any certificate, notice, or report furnished pursuant hereto,
is determined by any Bank to be false in any respect when made;

(c)  FAILURE TO PERFORM.  Any other term, covenant, or agreement
contained in any Loan Document is not performed or satisfied, and, if
remediable, such failure continues unremedied for 30 days after written
notice thereof has been given to Borrower by Agent;

(d)  DEFAULTS ON OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  There exists a default by
Borrower, Guarantor, or any Material Subsidiary in the performance of any
other agreement or obligation for the payment of borrowed money, for the
deferred purchase price of property or services, or for the payment of rent
under any lease, whether by acceleration or otherwise, which would permit
such obligation to be declared due and payable prior to its stated
maturity, with any such occurrence to be a Default immediately if the
obligation concerned exceeds $500,000 or, if such occurrence is with regard
to an obligation of $500,000 or less, if such default continues for 30 days
after Borrower, Guarantor, or such Material Subsidiary, as the case may be,
receives written notice thereof from the creditor so affected;

(e)  GUARANTIES.  Any Guarantor or any Material Subsidiary revokes or
attempts to revoke such guaranty, whether with respect to future
transactions or outstanding Obligations, or otherwise breaches the terms
and conditions of such guaranty, or violates any promise made pursuant to
this Agreement, or any such guaranty is ruled to be invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction;

(f)  CHANGE OF CONTROL.  Any Person (including any affiliated group of
individuals and/or entities) shall acquire 25% or more of the outstanding
voting stock of Guarantor; or Guarantor shall cease to own 100% of the
outstanding voting stock of Borrower;

(g)  AFFILIATES.  Any Material Subsidiary shall violate any of the
covenants made by it in a certificate in the form of Exhibit 5 attached
hereto, or any representation or warranty made or deemed made by it in such
certificate is determined by any Bank to be false in any material respect
when made, or any of the representations and warranties made by Guarantor
in the addendum to this Agreement is determined by any Bank to be false in
any material respect when made;

(h)  LOSS, DESTRUCTION, OR CONDEMNATION OF PROPERTY.  A portion of
Borrower's, Guarantor's, or any Material Subsidiary's property is affected
by any uninsured loss, damage, destruction, theft, sale, or encumbrance
other than created herein or is condemned, seized, or appropriated, the
effect of which materially impairs Borrower's, Guarantor's, or such
Material Subsidiary's financial condition or its ability to pay its debts
as they come due;


<PAGE>

(i)  ATTACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AND INSOLVENCY.  Borrower, Guarantor, or
any Material Subsidiary, or any of Borrower's, Guarantor's, or any such
Material Subsidiary's property is affected by any:

(I)  Judgment lien, execution, attachment, garnishment, general
assignment for the benefit of creditors, sequestration, or forfeiture,
to the extent Borrower's, Guarantor's, or such Material Subsidiary's
financial condition or its ability to pay its debts as they come due
is thereby materially impaired; or

(II) Proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to
receivership, insolvency, or bankruptcy, whether brought voluntarily
or involuntarily by or against Borrower, Guarantor, or any Material
Subsidiary, including, without limitation, any reorganization of
assets, deferment or arrangement of debts, or any similar proceeding,
and, if such proceeding is involuntarily brought against Borrower,
Guarantor, or such Material Subsidiary, it is not dismissed within 60
days;

(j)  JUDGMENTS.  Final judgment on claims not covered by insurance
which, together with other outstanding final judgments against Borrower,
Guarantor, or any Material Subsidiary, exceeds $500,000, is rendered
against Borrower, Guarantor, or any Material Subsidiary and is not
discharged, vacated, or reversed, or its execution stayed pending appeal,
within 60 days after entry, or is not discharged within 60 days after the
expiration of such stay; or

(k)  GOVERNMENT APPROVALS.  Any governmental approval, registration,
or filing with any governmental authority, now or later required in
connection with the performance by Borrower of its obligations under the
Loan Documents, is revoked, withdrawn, or withheld, or fails to remain in
full force and effect, except Borrower shall have 60 days after notice of
any such event to take whatever action is necessary to obtain all necessary
approvals, registrations, and filings.

14.2 REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT.  If any Default occurs under Subsection
14.1(i), the Banks' commitment to make Advances and Seafirst's commitment to
make Swing Line Advances and issue new Letters of Credit shall immediately
and automatically terminate (but Agent shall have no liability to any other
Bank for, and any risk participations shall be effective as to, any Advances
made by Agent or Letters of Credit issued by Seafirst prior to Agent
receiving actual notice of such occurrence, absent Agent's willful misconduct
or gross negligence), and all Obligations, including all accrued interest,
shall immediately and automatically become due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest, or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by Borrower, and Agent may immediately, upon receiving
notice of such an occurrence, exercise any or all of the following remedies
for Default; and if any other Default occurs and is continuing, Agent, upon
direction of Majority Banks, shall, by notice from Agent to Borrower:

(a)  TERMINATE COMMITMENTS.  Terminate Banks' commitment to make
Advances and Seafirst's commitment to make Swing Line Advances and issue
new Letters of Credit;

(b)  SUSPEND COMMITMENTS.  Refuse to make further Advances or Swing
Line Advances or issue new Letters of Credit until any Default has been
cured;

(c)  ACCELERATE.  Declare all Obligations, including all accrued
interest, to be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
protest, or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
Borrower;

(d)  COLLATERAL.  Proceed to realize on any or all Collateral by any
available means; and/or

(e)  ALL REMEDIES.  Pursue any other available legal and equitable
remedies.


<PAGE>

In addition, each Bank shall have the right to set off against, or place an
administrative freeze upon, deposit accounts of Borrower at such Bank any
amounts owing under the Obligations, including amounts in excess of such
Bank's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding balance of the Obligations.  Any
such amounts, and any other amounts received by any Bank on account of the
Obligations, other than from Agent, shall be delivered to Agent to be
distributed to each Bank in accordance with its respective Pro Rata Share;
PROVIDED, however, that if all or any portion of such payment turned over
from a Bank to Agent and distributed to each Bank is thereafter recovered by
Borrower from such Bank, each Bank shall, in accordance with its respective
Pro Rata Share, reimburse such other Bank for the amount so recovered.  All
of Banks' and Agent's rights and remedies in all Loan Documents shall be
cumulative and can be exercised separately or concurrently.  Borrower shall
have no liability to any Bank with respect to any sum that Agent receives in
accordance with this Agreement and fails to distribute to such Bank as
required by this Agreement.

14.3 DEFAULT INTEREST.  Upon Default, whether or not acceleration has
occurred, all outstanding Advances shall, upon direction by Majority Banks to
Agent, accrue interest at a floating rate per annum of 3.0% above the Base
Rate, as it may vary from time to time.

ARTICLE 15
MISCELLANEOUS

15.1 MANNER OF PAYMENTS.

(a)  PAYMENTS ON NONBUSINESS DAYS.  Whenever any event is to occur or
any payment is to be made under any Loan Document on any day other than a
Business Day, such event shall occur or such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included
in computation of interest in connection with any such payment.

(b)  PAYMENTS.  All payments and prepayments to be made by Borrower
shall be made to Agent when due, at Agent's office as may be designated by
Agent, without offsets or counterclaims for any amounts claimed by Borrower
to be due from Agent or Banks, in the currency advanced, and in immediately
available funds.

(c)  TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  All payments and prepayments to be made by
Borrower shall be made to Banks care of Agent, no later than 12:00 noon on
the date when due (with payments received after 12:00 noon to be deemed
received on the following Business Day), at Agent's office as may be
designated by Agent, without offsets or counterclaims for any amounts
claimed by Borrower to be due from any Bank, in the currency which was
advanced to Borrower and in immediately available funds.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, payments due under the Swing Line may be made until 3:30
p.m.

(d)  APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.  All payments made by Borrower shall be
applied first against fees, expenses, and indemnities due; second, against
interest due; and third, against principal, with Agent having the
obligation, after a Default which is continuing, to apply any payments or
collections received against the Obligations owing to the Banks in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.  Except for payments made
by Borrower to Agent for fees and indemnities due Agent, or payments made
with regard to Swing Line Advances or Letters of Credit in which no Bank
has been called upon to purchase a participation pursuant to Article 5, all
payments made by Borrower shall be deemed to be made to Agent, as agent for
Banks in accordance with each Bank's Pro Rata Share, and shall be
distributed by Agent to Banks according to their respective Pro Rata Share;
PROVIDED, that while Agent will make a good faith effort to make such
remittances on the same Business Day as received, if payments are received
from Borrower after 12:00 noon, and if it is not practicable for Agent to
make same-day remittances to the Banks, then Agent shall not be obligated
to remit funds to the Banks


<PAGE>

until the next Business Day, along with interest at the Fed Funds Rate.
Any such payments which are received by a Bank shall be delivered
immediately by such Bank to Agent for distribution to Banks in accordance
with this subsection.

(e)  RECORDING OF PAYMENTS.  Agent is authorized to record on a
schedule or computer-generated statement the date and amount of each
Advance and Swing Line Advance, all conversions between interest rate
options, and all payments of principal and interest.  All such schedules or
statements shall constitute PRIMA FACIE evidence of the accuracy of the
information so recorded.

(f)  ANTICIPATORY PAYMENTS.  Agent shall have the right (but not the
obligation), if it reasonably anticipates receipt of payment from Borrower
but has not actually received such payment, to forward payment to each Bank
of its respective Pro Rata Share; PROVIDED, that if Borrower fails within
one Business Day to make such payment, each Bank shall, immediately upon
the demand of Agent, return such funds to Agent.

(g)  PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO ADVANCES.  If an Advance is repaid by means
of a new Advance in a like amount, Agent shall credit such new Advance
directly to repayment of the maturing Advance, and no funds shall be
transferred to or from Banks.

(h)  MULTICURRENCY ADVANCES.  If a Multicurrency Advance is not repaid
on the date when due, Borrower shall indemnify Agent and all Banks for all
costs, expenses, and interest incurred by Agent and each such Bank in
covering any foreign exchange contracts and hedges entered into by such
parties with regard to such Multicurrency Advance.

15.2 NOTICES.  Agent may make Advances and conversions between interest
rates, and Seafirst shall make Swing Line Advances, based on telephonic,
telex, and oral requests made by any Person whom Agent in good faith believes
to be authorized to act on behalf of Borrower.  All other notices, demands,
and other communications to be given pursuant to any of the Loan Documents
shall be in writing and shall be deemed received the earlier of when actually
received, or two days after being mailed, postage prepaid and addressed as
follows, or as later designated in writing:

15.3 DOCUMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES.  Borrower shall pay,
reimburse, and indemnify Agent and Banks for all of Agent's and Banks'
reasonable costs and expenses, including, without limitation, all accounting,
appraisal, and report preparation fees or expenses, all attorneys' fees
(including the allocated cost of in-house counsel), legal expenses, and
recording or filing fees, incurred in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, and administration of this Agreement and


<PAGE>

all other Loan Documents, and all amendments, supplements, or modifications
thereto, and the perfection of all security interests, liens, or encumbrances
that may be granted to Banks; PROVIDED, that Borrower shall pay no more than
$3,000 in legal fees for the initial documentation of the facilities
evidenced by this Agreement. Borrower acknowledges that any legal counsel
retained or employed by Agent or Banks acts solely on the Agent's and Banks'
behalf and not on Borrower's behalf, despite Borrower's obligation to
reimburse Agent and Banks for the cost of such legal counsel, and that
Borrower has had sufficient opportunity to seek the advice of its own legal
counsel with regard to this Agreement.

15.4 COLLECTION EXPENSES.  The nonprevailing party shall, upon demand by
the prevailing party, reimburse the prevailing party for all of its costs,
expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (including the allocated cost of
in-house counsel) incurred in connection with any controversy or claim
between said parties relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, or to an alleged tort arising out of the transactions evidenced by
this Agreement, including those incurred in any action, bankruptcy
proceeding, arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution proceeding,
or appeal, or in the course of exercising any judicial or nonjudicial
remedies.

15.5 WAIVER.  No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the
part of Agent or Banks, any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.  Further,
no waiver or indulgence by Agent or Banks of any Default shall constitute a
waiver of Agent's and Banks' right to declare a subsequent similar failure or
event to be a Default.

15.6 ASSIGNMENT.  This Agreement is made expressly for the sole benefit
of Borrower and for the protection of Agent and Banks and their respective
successors and assigns.  The rights of Borrower hereunder shall not be
assignable by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of Agent and Banks.  Upon any assignment, the assigning Bank shall
pay Agent an assignment fee of $2,500.  Either Bank may at any time sell,
assign, grant participations in, or otherwise transfer to any other financial
institution (a "Participant") all or any part of its obligations under the
Letters of Credit and its rights under this Agreement and the Loan Documents,
with assignments only to be made with the consent of Borrower, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.  Participations may be sold without the consent
of Borrower, PROVIDED that any voting rights of such participants shall be
limited to matters of principal amount, interest rates, fees, payment dates,
release of any Collateral or any guarantors, and extensions of the
Termination Date or other maturities. Banks acknowledge and agree that any
such disposition will not alter or affect such Bank's direct obligations
under this Agreement and under the Letters of Credit and its participation
therein.  Borrower acknowledges that any such Participant will become an
owner PRO RATA of the Obligations, and Borrower waives any right it may have
to setoff the Obligations against any claims or counterclaims it may have
against the Bank selling such participation. Assignments by Banks, as opposed
to participations, must be in minimum amounts of $5,000,000, and may only be
made with the prior written consent of Borrower and Agent.  It is the
intention of the parties that Borrower's obligation to pay or reimburse
expenses will not be increased because of an assignment or the creation or
transfer of a participation interest.  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Borrower shall not be required to pay or reimburse
Agent or Banks for any fees, costs, or expenses, including attorneys' fees,
relating to the creation or transfer of any assignment or participation
interest.  Neither shall Borrower be required to pay or reimburse Agent or
Banks for any documentation and administration expenses incurred by an
assignee or Participant except to the extent that such expenses are in lieu
of, and not in addition to, expenses incurred by Seafirst or Mellon.

15.7 MERGER.  The rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement
shall not merge into or be extinguished by any of the Loan Documents, but
shall continue and remain valid and enforceable.  This Agreement and the
other Loan Documents constitute Agent's and Banks' entire agreement with
Borrower with regard to the Revolving Loan, the Swing Line, and the Letters
of Credit, and supersede all prior writings and oral negotiations.  No oral
or written representation, covenant, commitment,


<PAGE>

waiver, or promise of either Agent, any Bank or Borrower shall have any
effect, whether made before or after the date of this Agreement, unless
contained in this Agreement or another Loan Document, or in an amendment
complying with Section 15.8.  ORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN
MONEY, TO EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE
NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.

15.8  AMENDMENTS.  Any amendment or waiver of, or consent to any
departure by Borrower from any provision of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be in writing signed by each party to be bound thereby, and
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given.  Banks authorize Agent (i) to make the following amendments
only upon the prior written consent of all Banks:

(a)  increase the Credit Limit or the maximum amounts permitted for
the Swing Line or issuance of Letters of Credit;

(b)  extend the Termination Date;

(c)  release any guaranty of the Obligations, or release any
Collateral;

(d)  reduce the principal, interest, or interest rate on the Revolving
Loan or Swing Line, or the issuance fees charged with regard to Letters of
Credit, or fees otherwise accruing under this Agreement, from that
otherwise required under this Agreement; or

(e)  postpone the date fixed for payment of any principal, interest,
or fees;

and (ii) to waive, change, or release Borrower from any affirmative or
negative covenant under this Agreement only upon the prior written consent of
Majority Banks.  Seafirst shall not make Swing Line Advances after the
occurrence of and during the continuance of a Default without the consent of
all Banks.

15.9  CONSTRUCTION.  Each term of this Agreement and each Loan Document
shall be binding to the extent permitted by law and shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Washington, excluding its conflict of laws rules.  If
one or more of the provisions of this Agreement should be invalid, illegal,
or unenforceable in any respect, the remaining provisions of this Agreement
shall remain effective and enforceable.  If there is a conflict among the
provisions of any Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall be
controlling. The captions and organization of this Agreement are for
convenience only, and shall not be construed to affect any provision of this
Agreement.

15.10 COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures to such counterparts were upon the same instrument.  This
Agreement shall become effective when Agent shall have received counterparts
of the Agreement signed by all of the parties to the Agreement.

CONSENT OF GUARANTOR

The undersigned Guarantor acknowledges receipt of a copy of the above
Agreement, consents to its contents, and agrees to comply with the covenants
of Sections 11.2 through 11.14 thereof.  By submitting each of the financial
statements required by Subsection 11.5(a) and 11.5(b), Guarantor is deemed to
represent and warrant that: (a) such statement is complete and correct and
fairly presents the consolidated financial condition of Guarantor as of the
date of such statement; (b) such statement discloses all liabilities of
Guarantor that are required to be reflected or reserved against under GAAP,
whether liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or contingent; and (c) such
statement has been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  As of the date of
execution of this Agreement, there has been no adverse change in Guarantor's
financial condition since preparation of the last such financial statements
delivered to Banks which would materially impair Guarantor's ability to honor
Guarantor's guaranty of the Obligations.  Guarantor hereby adopts and
repeats, as to Guarantor, all representations and warranties made by Borrower
as to Borrower in Article 10 of the above Agreement.

EXHIBIT 1 TO CREDIT AGREEMENT

PREPAYMENT FEES

If the principal balance of this note is prepaid in whole or in part,
whether by voluntary prepayment, operation of law, acceleration or otherwise,
a prepayment fee, in addition to any interest earned, will be immediately
payable to the holder of this note.

The amount of the prepayment fee depends on the following:

(1) The amount by which interest reference rates as defined below have changed
between the time the loan is prepaid and either a) the time the loan was
made for fixed rate loans, or b) the time the interest rate last changed
(repriced) for variable rate loans.
(2) A prepayment fee factor (see "Prepayment Fee Factor Schedule" on reverse).
(3) The amount of principal prepaid.

If the proceeds from a CD or time deposit pledged to secure the loan are used
to prepay the loan resulting in payment of an early withdrawal penalty for
the CD, a prepayment fee will not also be charged under the loan.

DEFINITION OF PREPAYMENT REFERENCE RATE FOR VARIABLE RATE LOANS

The "Prepayment Reference Rate" used to represent interest rate levels for
variable rate loans shall be the index rate used to determine the rate on
this loan having maturities equivalent to the remaining period to interest
rate change date (repricing) of this loan rounded upward to the nearest
month. The "Initial Prepayment Reference Rate" shall be the Prepayment
Reference Rate at the time of last repricing and a new Initial Prepayment
Reference Rate shall be assigned at each subsequent repricing.  The "Final
Prepayment Reference Rate" shall be the Prepayment Reference Rate at the time
of prepayment.

DEFINITION OF PREPAYMENT REFERENCE RATE FOR FIXED RATE LOANS

The "Prepayment Reference Rate" used to represent interest rate levels on
fixed rate loans shall be the bond equivalent yield of the average U.S.
Treasury rate having maturities equivalent to the remaining period to
maturity of this loan rounded upward to the nearest month. The "Initial
Prepayment Reference Rate" shall be the Prepayment Reference Rate at the time
the loan was made.  The "Final Prepayment Reference Rate" shall be the
Prepayment Reference Rate at time of prepayment.

The Prepayment Reference Rate shall be interpolated from the yields as
displayed on Page 119 of the Dow Jones Telerate Service (or such other page
or service as may replace that page or service for the purpose of displaying
rates comparable to said U.S. Treasury rates) on the day the loan was made
(Initial Prepayment Reference Rate) or the day of prepayment (Final
Prepayment Reference Rate).

CALCULATION OF PREPAYMENT FEE

If the Initial Prepayment Reference Rate is less than or equal to the Final
Prepayment Reference Rate, there is no prepayment fee.

If the Initial Prepayment Reference Rate is greater than the Final Prepayment
Reference Rate, the prepayment fee shall be equal to the difference between the
Initial and Final Prepayment Reference Rates (expressed as a decimal),
multiplied by the appropriate factor from the Prepayment Fee Factor Schedule,
multiplied by the principal amount of the loan being prepaid.

EXAMPLE OF PREPAYMENT FEE CALCULATION

VARIABLE RATE LOAN: A non-amortizing 6-month LIBOR based loan with principal
of $250,000 is fully prepaid with 3 months remaining until next interest rate
change date (repricing). An Initial Prepayment Reference Rate of 7.0% was
assigned to the loan at last repricing.  The Final Prepayment Reference Rate
(as determined by the 3-month LIBOR index) is 6.5%. Rates therefore have
dropped 0.5% since last repricing and a prepayment fee applies.  A prepayment
fee factor of 0.31 is determined from Table 3 below and the prepayment fee is
computed as follows:

Prepayment Fee = (0.07 - 0.065) x (0.31) x ($250,000) = $387.50

FIXED RATE LOAN: An amortizing loan with remaining principal of $250,000 is
fully prepaid with 24 months remaining until maturity. An Initial Prepayment
Reference Rate of 9.0% was assigned to the loan when the loan was made. The
Final Prepayment Reference Rate (as determined by the current 24-month U.S.
Treasury rate on Page 119 of Telerate) is 7.5%. Rates therefore have dropped
1.5% since the loan was made and a prepayment fee applies. A prepayment fee
factor of 1.3 is determined from Table 1 below and the prepayment fee is
computed as follows:

Prepayment Fee = (0.09 - 0.075) x (1.3) x ($250,000) = $4,875

ARTICLE II

AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY

Section 2.1 Revolving Advances. The Lender agrees, subject to the terms and
conditions of this  Agreement,  to make advances  ("Revolving  Advances") to the
Borrower from time to time from the date that all of the conditions set forth in
Section 4.1 are satisfied (the "Funding  Date") to and until (but not including)
the Termination Date in an amount not in excess of the Maximum Line Amount.  The
Lender shall have no obligation  to make a Revolving  Advance to the extent that
the  amount  of  the  requested  Revolving  Advance  exceeds  Availability.  The
Borrower's  obligation to pay the Revolving  Advances  shall be evidenced by the
Revolving  Note and shall be  secured by the  Collateral.  Within the limits set
forth in this Section 2.1, the Borrower may borrow,  prepay  pursuant to Section
2.10, and reborrow.

Section 2.2 Procedures for Requesting  Advances.  The Borrower shall comply
with the following procedures in requesting Revolving Advances:

(a)  Type of  Advances.  Each  Advance  shall be funded as a Floating  Rate
Advance.

(b)  Time for Requests.  The Borrower shall request each Advance so that it
is received by Lender not later than the Cut-off  Time on the Business
Day on which the Advance is to be made.  Each request that conforms to
the terms of this  Agreement  shall be  effective  upon receipt by the
Lender, shall be in writing or by telephone or telecopy  transmission,
and shall be  confirmed  in writing by the Borrower if so requested by
the  Lender,  by (i) an  Officer  of the  Borrower;  or (ii) a  Person
designated as the Borrower's  agent by an Officer of the Borrower in a
writing  delivered  to the  Lender;  or (iii) a Person whom the Lender
reasonably  believes  to be an  Officer  of  the  Borrower  or  such a
designated  agent.  The Borrower  shall repay all Advances even if the
Lender  does not  receive  such  confirmation  and even if the  Person
requesting an Advance was not in fact authorized to do so. Any request
for an Advance, whether written or telephonic, shall be deemed to be a
representation  by the  Borrower  that  the  conditions  set  forth in
Section 4.2 have been satisfied as of the time of the request.

(c)  Disbursement.  Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth
in Article IV, the Lender shall disburse the proceeds of the requested
Advance by crediting the Borrower's  operating account maintained with
Community  Bank,  N.A.  provided  such account is subject to a deposit
account control agreement in favor of Lender and in form and substance
acceptable to Lender, or by crediting the Borrower's operating account
maintained  with the  Lender  (if  any),  unless  the  Lender  and the
Borrower shall agree to another manner of disbursement. The Lender may
also initiate an Advance and disburse the proceeds to any third Person
in such amounts as the Lender, in its sole discretion, deems necessary
to protect its interest in any Collateral or to purchase Collateral or
to  exercise  any other  rights  granted to it by the  Borrower  under
Section 6.27.

Section 2.3       Intentionally Omitted.

Section 2.4       Intentionally Omitted.

Section 2.5       Intentionally Omitted.

Section 2.6       Interest; Minimum Loan Balance; Default Interest
Rate; Application of Payments;
Participations; Usury.

(a)  Interest. Except as provided in Section 2.6(d) and Section 2.6(g), the
principal  amount of each  Advance  shall bear  interest as a Floating
Rate Advance.

(b)  Minimum  Loan  Balance.   Notwithstanding  any  other  terms  of  this
Agreement  to the  contrary,  the  Borrower  shall  pay to the  Lender
interest on Revolving  Advances based upon an amount not less than the
Minimum  Loan  Balance  each  calendar  month  during the term of this
Agreement,  and the  Borrower  shall pay any  deficiency  between  the
amount of interest  due on the Minimum  Loan Balance and the amount of
interest  otherwise  calculated  under  Section  2.6(a) for  Revolving
Advances on the first day of each month and on the Termination Date.

(c)  Intentionally Omitted.

(d)  Default  Interest  Rate.  At any time  during  any  Default  Period or
following the  Termination  Date, in the Lender's sole  discretion and
without waiving any of its other rights or remedies,  the principal of
the  Revolving  Note shall bear  interest at the Default  Rate or such
lesser rate as the Lender may determine, effective as of the first day
of the fiscal  quarter in which any Default  Period begins through the
last day of such Default  Period,  or any shorter time period that the
Lender may determine. The decision of the Lender to impose a rate that
is less than the Default  Rate or to not impose the  Default  Rate for
the entire  duration of the Default Period shall be made by the Lender
in its sole  discretion  and shall not be a waiver of any of its other
rights and remedies,  including its right to retroactively  impose the
full  Default  Rate for the  entirety  of any such  Default  Period or
following the Termination Date.

(e)  Application of Payments. Payments shall be applied to the Indebtedness
on the Business  Day of receipt by the Lender in the Lender's  general
account,  but the amount of  principal  paid shall  continue to accrue
interest  at the  interest  rate  applicable  under  the terms of this
Agreement from the calendar day the Lender  receives the payment,  and
continuing  through  the  end of the  second  Business  Day  following
receipt of the payment.

(f)  Participations.  If any Person shall  acquire a  participation  in the
Advances or the  Obligation of  Reimbursement,  the Borrower  shall be
obligated  to the  Lender  to pay  the  full  amount  of all  interest
calculated under this Section 2.6, along with all other fees,  charges
and other amounts due under this Agreement,  regardless if such Person
elects to accept interest with respect to its participation at a lower
rate than that calculated  under this Section 2.6, or otherwise elects
to accept less than its prorata share of such fees,  charges and other
amounts due under this Agreement.

(g)  Usury.  In any event no rate  change  shall be put into  effect  which
would result in a rate greater than the highest rate permitted by law.
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  any  Loan
Document,  all  agreements  which either now are or which shall become
agreements  between the Borrower and the Lender are hereby  limited so
that in no contingency or event  whatsoever  shall the total liability
for payments in the nature of interest,  additional interest and other
charges exceed the applicable  limits imposed by any applicable  usury
laws. If any payments in the nature of interest,  additional  interest
and  other  charges  made  under any Loan  Document  are held to be in
excess of the  limits  imposed by any  applicable  usury  laws,  it is
agreed that any such amount held to be in excess  shall be  considered
payment of principal hereunder,  and the indebtedness evidenced hereby
shall be  reduced  by such  amount  so that the  total  liability  for
payments  in the nature of  interest,  additional  interest  and other
charges  shall  not  exceed  the  applicable  limits  imposed  by  any
applicable  usury laws, in compliance with the desires of the Borrower
and the Lender. This provision shall never be superseded or waived and
shall  control  every other  provision of the Loan  Documents  and all
agreements  between the Borrower and the Lender,  or their  successors
and assigns.

Section 2.7       Fees.

(a)  Origination  Fee. The Borrower shall pay the Lender a fully earned and
non-refundable  origination  fee of $50,000,  due and payable upon the
execution of this Agreement.

(b)  Unused Line Fee.  For the  purposes of this  Section  2.7(b),  "Unused
Amount" means the Maximum Line Amount reduced by outstanding Revolving
Advances.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender an unused line fee
at the  rate of  one-half  of one  percent  (0.50%)  per  annum on the
average  daily  Unused  Amount from the date of this  Agreement to and
including the Termination  Date, due and payable monthly in arrears on
the first day of the month and on the Termination Date.

(c)  Monthly  Monitoring  Fee. The  Borrower  agrees to pay to the Lender a
monthly  monitoring  fee in the  amount  of $500  per  month,  due and
payable  monthly  in arrears on the first day of each month and on the
Termination Date.

(d)  Collateral  Exam  Fees.  The  Borrower  shall pay the  Lender  fees in
connection with any collateral exams, audits or inspections  conducted
by or on behalf of the Lender of any  Collateral or of the  Borrower's
operations or business at the rates  established  from time to time by
the  Lender  (which  fees are  currently  $950 per day per  collateral
examiner),  together with any related out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Lender.

(e)  Intentionally Omitted.

(f)  Termination and Line Reduction Fees. If (i) the Lender  terminates the
Credit  Facility  during a  Default  Period,  or if (ii) the  Borrower
terminates  or  reduces  the  Credit  Facility  on a date prior to the
Maturity  Date,  then the Borrower  shall pay the Lender as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty a termination fee in an amount equal to a
percentage of the Maximum Line Amount (or the reduction of the Maximum
Line  Amount,  as the case may be)  calculated  as follows:  (A) three
percent (3%) if the  termination or reduction  occurs on or before the
first  anniversary  of the Funding  Date;  (B) two percent (2%) if the
termination  or reduction  occurs after the first  anniversary  of the
Funding Date,  but on or before the second  anniversary of the Funding
Date; and (C) one percent (1%) if the termination or reduction  occurs
after the second anniversary of the Funding Date.

(g)  Overadvance  Fees. The Borrower  shall pay an  Overadvance  fee in the
amount  of $500  for  each  day or  portion  thereof  during  which an
Overadvance  exists,  regardless  of how  the  Overadvance  arises  or
whether or not the  Overadvance  has been  agreed to in advance by the
Lender.  The acceptance of payment of an Overadvance fee by the Lender
shall not be deemed to constitute either consent to the Overadvance or
a  waiver  of the  resulting  Event  of  Default,  unless  the  Lender
specifically  consents  to the  Overadvance  in writing and waives the
Event of Default on whatever conditions the Lender deems appropriate.

(h)  Other  Fees and  Charges.  The  Lender  may from  time to time  impose
additional  fees and charges as  consideration  for  Advances  made in
excess of Availability or for other events that constitute an Event of
Default or a Default  hereunder,  including  fees and  charges for the
administration  of Collateral by the Lender,  and fees and charges for
the late  delivery of reports,  which may be assessed in the  Lender's
sole discretion on either an hourly,  periodic, or flat fee basis, and
in lieu of or in addition to imposing interest at the Default Rate.

Section 2.8       Time for Interest Payments; Payment on Non-Business
Days; Computation of Interest and Fees.

(a)  Time For Interest  Payments.  Accrued and unpaid interest shall be due
and payable on the first day of each month and on the Termination Date
(each  an  "Interest  Payment  Date"),  or if  any  such  day is not a
Business  Day, on the next  succeeding  Business  Day.  Interest  will
accrue from the most recent date to which  interest  has been paid or,
if no interest has been paid, from the date of advance to the Interest
Payment  Date.  If an  Interest  Payment  Date is not a Business  Day,
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.

(b)  Payment  on  Non-Business  Days.  Whenever  any  payment  to  be  made
hereunder  shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a  Business
Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and
such  extension  of  time  shall  in  such  case  be  included  in the
computation of interest on the Advances or the fees hereunder,  as the
case may be.

(c)  Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest accruing on the outstanding
principal balance of the Advances and fees hereunder  outstanding from
time to time shall be computed  on the basis of actual  number of days
elapsed in a year of 360 days.

Section 2.9       Collateral Account; Sweep of Funds.

(a)  Collateral Account.

(i)  The Borrower shall cause all proceeds of sales of Inventory to be

deposit  all  other  cash  proceeds  of  Collateral  and all cash
proceeds from other  property and assets of Borrower  (including,
without limitation,  proceeds from any loss or condemnation of or
from  the  sale  or  other  disposition  of  any  real  property)
regardless  of  source  or  nature  directly  into  a  Collateral
Account.  Until so  deposited,  the Borrower  shall hold all such
payments  and cash  proceeds in trust for and as the  property of
the Lender and shall not commingle  such property with any of its
other funds or property.  All  deposits in a  Collateral  Account
shall constitute  proceeds of Collateral and shall not constitute
payment of the Indebtedness.

(ii) All items received by Lender from a depositary bank maintaining a
Collateral Account shall be subject to final payment. If any such
item is returned  uncollected,  the Borrower will immediately pay
the Lender, or, for items deposited in a Collateral Account,  the
depositary  bank  maintaining  such  account,  the amount of that
item, or such  depositary  bank at its  discretion may charge any
uncollected  item to the Borrower's  commercial  account or other
account. The Borrower shall be liable as an endorser on all items
deposited  in a  Collateral  Account,  whether  or  not  in  fact
endorsed by the Borrower.

(b)  Sweep of Funds.  Funds  received  by  Lender  from a  depositary  bank
maintaining a Collateral  Account shall be transferred to the Lender's
general account for payment of the Indebtedness.  Amounts deposited in
a  Collateral  Account  shall  not be  subject  to  withdrawal  by the
Borrower,   except  after   payment  in  full  and  discharge  of  all
Indebtedness.

Section  2.10......Voluntary  Prepayment;  Reduction  of the  Maximum  Line
Amount;  Termination of the Credit Facility by the Borrower. Except as otherwise
provided  herein,  the  Borrower may prepay the Advances in whole at any time or
from time to time in part.  The Borrower may  terminate  the Credit  Facility or
reduce the  Maximum  Line Amount at any time if it (i) gives the Lender at least
90 days advance written notice prior to the proposed  Termination Date, and (ii)
pays the Lender applicable termination and reduction fees in accordance with the
terms of this  Agreement.  Any  reduction in the Maximum Line Amount shall be in
multiples of $100,000, and with a minimum reduction of at least $500,000. If the
Borrower  terminates  the Credit  Facility or reduces the Maximum Line Amount to
zero, all Indebtedness shall be immediately due and payable, and if the Borrower
gives the Lender less than the required 90 days advance written notice, then the
interest rate applicable to borrowings  evidenced by Revolving Note shall be the
Default  Rate for the period of time  commencing  90 days prior to the  proposed
Termination Date through the date that the Lender actually receives such written
notice.  If the  Borrower  does not wish the Lender to  consider  renewal of the
Credit  Facility on the next  Maturity  Date,  then the Borrower  shall give the
Lender at least 90 days written  notice prior to the Maturity  Date that it will
not be requesting  renewal. If the Borrower fails to give the Lender such timely
notice,  then the  interest  rate  applicable  to  borrowings  evidenced  by the
Revolving  Note shall be the Default Rate for the period of time  commencing  90
days  prior to the  Maturity  Date  through  the date that the  Lender  actually
receives such written notice.

Section 2.11 Mandatory  Prepayment.  Without  notice or demand,  unless the
Lender shall otherwise  consent in a written agreement that sets forth the terms
and  conditions  which  the  Lender  in its  discretion  may  deem  appropriate,
including  without   limitation  the  payment  of  an  Overadvance  fee,  if  an
Overadvance  shall at any time exist with respect to the Credit  Facility,  then
the  Borrower  shall  immediately  prepay the  Revolving  Advances to the extent
necessary  to  eliminate  such excess.  Any  voluntary  or mandatory  prepayment
received by the Lender may be applied to the Indebtedness,  in such order and in
such amounts as the Lender in its sole  discretion  may  determine  from time to
time.

Section 2.12 Revolving  Advances to Pay Indebtedness.  Notwithstanding  the
terms of Section 2.1, the Lender may, in its discretion at any time or from time
to time,  without the Borrower's request and even if the conditions set forth in
Section 4.2 would not be satisfied,  make a Revolving Advance in an amount equal
to the  portion of the  Indebtedness  from time to time due and  payable and may
deliver the  proceeds  of any such  Revolving  Advance to Wells  Fargo  Merchant
Services,  L.L.C. in  satisfaction of any unpaid  obligations due to Wells Fargo
Merchant Services, L.L.C.

Section  2.13 Use of  Proceeds.  The  Borrower  shall use the  proceeds  of
Advances for ordinary working capital purposes.

Section 2.14 Liability Records.  The Lender may maintain from time to time,
at its discretion,  records as to the Indebtedness. All entries made on any such
record shall be presumed  correct until the Borrower  establishes  the contrary.
Upon the Lender's  demand,  the  Borrower  will admit and certify in writing the
exact principal balance of the Indebtedness that the Borrower then asserts to be
outstanding. Any billing statement or accounting rendered by the Lender shall be
conclusive  and fully  binding on the  Borrower  unless the  Borrower  gives the
Lender specific written notice of exception within 30 days after receipt.

ARTICLE III

assigns  and grants to the  Lender,  for the  benefit of itself and as agent for
Wells  Fargo  Merchant   Services,   L.L.C.,   a  lien  and  security   interest
(collectively  referred to as the  "Security  Interest") in the  Collateral,  as
security  for the  payment  and  performance  of:  (a) all  present  and  future
Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lender;  (b) all obligations of the Borrower
and rights of the Lender  under this  Agreement;  and (c) all present and future

may at any time (whether or not a Default Period then exists) notify any account
debtor or other  Person  obligated  to pay the  amount  due that  such  right to
payment has been assigned or transferred to the Lender for security and shall be
paid directly to the Lender. The Borrower will join in giving such notice if the
Lender so  requests.  At any time after the  Borrower  or the Lender  gives such
notice to an account debtor or other  obligor,  the Lender may, but need not, in
the Lender's name or in the Borrower's name, demand, sue for, collect or receive
any money or  property  at any time  payable or  receivable  on  account  of, or
securing,  any such  right to  payment,  or grant  any  extension  to,  make any
compromise  or settlement  with or otherwise  agree to waive,  modify,  amend or
change the obligations  (including  collateral  obligations) of any such account
debtor  or  other  obligor.  The  Lender  may,  in the  Lender's  name or in the
Borrower's name, as the Borrower's agent and attorney-in-fact, notify the United
States Postal Service to change the address for delivery of the Borrower's  mail
to any address  designated by the Lender,  otherwise  intercept  the  Borrower's
mail,  and  receive,  open and  dispose of the  Borrower's  mail,  applying  all
Collateral as permitted  under this Agreement and holding all other mail for the
Borrower's account or forwarding such mail to the Borrower's last known address.

Section 3.3 Assignment of Insurance. As additional security for the payment
and performance of the  Indebtedness,  the Borrower hereby assigns to the Lender
any and all monies  (including  proceeds  of  insurance  and refunds of unearned
premiums) due or to become due under,  and all other rights of the Borrower with
respect  to, any and all  policies  of  insurance  now or at any time  hereafter
covering  the  Collateral  or any evidence  thereof or any  business  records or
valuable papers pertaining  thereto,  and the Borrower hereby directs the issuer
of any such policy to pay all such monies  directly to the Lender.  At any time,
whether or not a Default  Period then exists,  the Lender may (but need not), in
the Lender's name or in the Borrower's name, execute and deliver proof of claim,
receive  all such  monies,  endorse  checks and other  instruments  representing
payment of such monies,  and adjust,  litigate,  compromise or release any claim
against the issuer of any such  policy.  Any monies  received as payment for any
loss under any insurance policy mentioned above (other than liability  insurance
policies) or as payment of any award or compensation  for condemnation or taking
by eminent domain, shall be paid over to the Lender to be applied, at the option
of the  Lender,  either  to the  prepayment  of the  Indebtedness  or  shall  be
disbursed to the Borrower under staged payment terms reasonably  satisfactory to
the  Lender  for   application  to  the  cost  of  repairs,   replacements,   or
restorations.  Any such repairs, replacements, or restorations shall be effected
with  reasonable  promptness and shall be of a value at least equal to the value
of the items or property destroyed prior to such damage or destruction.

Section 3.4 Occupancy.

(a)  The Borrower hereby irrevocably grants to the Lender the right to take
exclusive  possession  of the  Premises  at any time  during a Default
Period without notice or consent.

(b)  The Lender may use the Premises  only to hold,  process,  manufacture,
sell,  use,  store,  liquidate,  realize upon or otherwise  dispose of
items that are  Collateral  and for other purposes that the Lender may
in good faith deem to be related or incidental purposes.

(c)  The Lender's right to hold the Premises shall cease and terminate upon

(d)  The Lender  shall not be  obligated  to pay or account for any rent or
other compensation for the possession,  occupancy or use of any of the
Premises;  provided,  however,  that if the Lender does pay or account
for any rent or other  compensation  for the possession,  occupancy or
use of any of the Premises,  the Borrower  shall  reimburse the Lender
promptly for the full amount thereof.  In addition,  the Borrower will
pay, or reimburse the Lender for, all taxes,  fees,  duties,  imposts,
charges  and  expenses  at any time  incurred  by or imposed  upon the
Lender by reason of the execution,  delivery, existence,  recordation,
performance or enforcement of this Agreement or the provisions of this
Section 3.4.

Section 3.5 License.  Without limiting the generality of any other Security
Document,  the Borrower hereby grants to the Lender a  non-exclusive,  worldwide
and royalty-free  license to use or otherwise exploit all Intellectual  Property
Rights of the Borrower for the purpose of: (a) completing the manufacture of any
in-process  materials  during any Default Period so that such  materials  become
saleable Inventory, all in accordance with the same quality standards previously

collateral  including  commercial  tort claims as the Lender deems  necessary or
useful to perfect the Security Interest.  All financing  statements filed before
the date hereof to perfect the Security Interest were authorized by the Borrower
and are hereby  re-authorized.  A carbon,  photographic or other reproduction of
this  Agreement  or of  any  financing  statements  signed  by the  Borrower  is
sufficient as a financing statement and may be filed as a financing statement in
any state to perfect the security  interests  granted hereby.  For this purpose,

Obligation,  whether  or not due.  In  addition,  each  other  Person  holding a
participating  interest in any Indebtedness  shall have the right to appropriate
or  setoff  any  deposit  or other  liability  then  owed by such  Person to the
Borrower,  whether  or not  due,  and  apply  the  same to the  payment  of said

accounts,  contract  rights or chattel  paper,  and,  as  provided  by law,  the
Borrower is entitled to any surplus and shall remain liable for any  deficiency.
The  Lender's  duty of care with respect to  Collateral  in its  possession  (as
imposed by law) shall be deemed  fulfilled  if it exercises  reasonable  care in
physically keeping such Collateral,  or in the case of Collateral in the custody
or possession of a bailee or other third Person,  exercises  reasonable  care in
the  selection  of the bailee or other  third  Person,  and the Lender  need not
otherwise preserve, protect, insure or care for any Collateral. The Lender shall
not be obligated  to preserve  any rights the  Borrower  may have against  prior
parties,  to realize on the  Collateral  at all or in any  particular  manner or
order or to apply any cash proceeds of the Collateral in any particular order of
application.  The Lender has no obligation to clean-up or otherwise  prepare the
Collateral  for sale.  The Borrower  waives any right it may have to require the
Lender to pursue any third Person for any of the Indebtedness.

statements  of WiseBuys for the  fiscal-year-to-date  period ended  December 31,
2007 and those statements fairly present the Borrower's  financial  condition on
the dates  thereof  and the  results  of its  operations  and cash flows for the
periods then ended and were prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Since the date of
the most recent financial statements, there has been no change in the Borrower's

financial  condition,  properties  or  operations  of the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates.

assessment received by any of them to the extent such taxes have become due.

without any additional compensation,  any Intellectual Property Rights
created,  discovered  or invented by such Person in the course of such
Person's  employment  or engagement  with the Borrower  (except to the
extent  prohibited  by law),  and  further  requiring  such  Person to
cooperate with the Borrower,  without any additional compensation,  in
connection  with  securing and  enforcing  any  Intellectual  Property
Rights therein; provided,  however, that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to employees and  subcontractors  whose job  descriptions
are  of  the  type  such  that  no  such  assignments  are  reasonably
foreseeable.

(c)  Intellectual Property Rights Licensed from Others.  Schedule 5.11 is a
complete list of all agreements  under which the Borrower has licensed
Intellectual   Property   Rights  from   another   Person   ("Licensed
Intellectual  Property") other than readily available,  non-negotiated

solely  for  performing   accounting,   word  processing  and  similar
administrative tasks  ("Off-the-shelf  Software") and a summary of any
ongoing  payments  the  Borrower  is  obligated  to make with  respect

any notice or has any knowledge to the effect that it is not in full  compliance
with any of the  requirements  of ERISA,  the IRC or  applicable  state law with

tax-qualified  status.  Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) any
accumulated  funding  deficiency (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section
412 of the IRC) under any Plan, whether or not waived,  (ii) any liability under
Section  4201  or  4243  of  ERISA  for  any  withdrawal,   partial  withdrawal,

liability or knowledge of any facts or  circumstances  which could result in any
liability to the Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation,  the Internal  Revenue
Service,  the Department of Labor or any participant in connection with any Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits under the Plan).

Section 5.13 Default.  The Borrower is in compliance with all provisions of
all  agreements,  instruments,  decrees  and orders to which it is a party or by
which it or its  property is bound or  affected,  the breach or default of which

Section 5.14 Environmental Matters.

(a)  Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.14,  there are not present in, on or
under the Premises any  Hazardous  Substances in such form or quantity
as to create  any  material  liability  or  obligation  for either the

materially changed.

(e)  Except as disclosed on Schedule  5.14,  the Premises are not and never
have been listed on the National  Priorities  List, the  Comprehensive
Environmental Response,  Compensation and Liability Information System
or any similar federal, state or local list, schedule,  log, inventory
or database.

effect with respect thereto.

Section 5.17 Rights to Payment.  Each right to payment and each instrument,
document,   chattel  paper  and  other  agreement   constituting  or  evidencing
Collateral is (or, in the case of all future Collateral, will be when arising or

defense,  setoff or  counterclaim,  of the account debtor or other obligor named
therein or in the Borrower's  records  pertaining  thereto as being obligated to
pay such obligation.

Section 5.18 Financial Solvency. Both before and after giving effect to the

and will from time to time  replace or repair any worn,  defective  or
broken parts;  provided,  however, that nothing in this covenant shall
prevent the Borrower from  discontinuing the operation and maintenance
of any of its properties if such  discontinuance is, in the Borrower's

maintain its Intellectual Property Rights.

applicable  Intellectual  Property  Rights are no longer useful in its
business.  If the Borrower transfers any Intellectual  Property Rights
for value,  the Borrower  will pay over the proceeds to the Lender for
application  to the  Indebtedness.  The Borrower  will not license any

Section 6.27  Performance by the Lender.  If the Borrower at any time fails
to perform or observe any of the foregoing  covenants  contained in this Article
VI or elsewhere  herein,  and if such failure shall continue for a period of ten
calendar days after the Lender gives the Borrower  written notice thereof (or in
the  case  of the  agreements  contained  in  Section  6.13  and  Section  6.15,
immediately  upon the  occurrence  of such failure,  without  notice or lapse of
time),  the Lender may, but need not, perform or observe such covenant on behalf
and in the name, place and stead of the Borrower (or, at the Lender's option, in
the Lender's  name) and may, but need not,  take any and all other actions which
the  Lender may  reasonably  deem  necessary  to cure or  correct  such  failure
(including the payment of taxes,  the  satisfaction of Liens, the performance of
obligations  owed to account  debtors or other  obligors,  the  procurement  and
maintenance of insurance, the execution of assignments,  security agreements and
financing  statements,  and the  endorsement of  instruments);  and the Borrower

expenses)  incurred  by the  Lender  in  connection  with or as a result  of the
performance or observance of such agreements or the taking of such action by the
Lender, together with interest thereon from the date expended or incurred at the
Default  Rate.  To  facilitate  the Lender's  performance  or observance of such
covenants of the Borrower,  the Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender,
or the Lender's  delegate,  acting  alone,  as the  Borrower's  attorney in fact
(which  appointment  is coupled  with an  interest)  with the right (but not the
duty) from time to time to create, prepare, complete,  execute, deliver, endorse
or file in the name  and on  behalf  of the  Borrower  any and all  instruments,
documents, assignments, security agreements, financing statements,  applications
for insurance and other agreements required to be obtained,  executed, delivered
or endorsed by the Borrower hereunder.

Subordination Agreement;

(q)  The Lender believes in good faith that the prospect of payment in full

prior hearing or notice thereof,  which the Borrower hereby  expressly
waives) and the right to sell,  lease or  otherwise  dispose of any or
all of the Collateral (with or without giving any warranties as to the
Collateral,  title to the Collateral or similar  warranties),  and, in
connection  therewith,  the  Borrower  will  on  demand  assemble  the

ARTICLE VIII

MISCELLANEOUS

Section  8.1 No Waiver;  Cumulative  Remedies;  Compliance  with  Laws.  No
failure or delay by the Lender in  exercising  any right,  power or remedy under
the Loan Documents  shall operate as a waiver  thereof;  nor shall any single or
partial  exercise  of any such  right,  power or  remedy  preclude  any other or
further  exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other  right,  power or remedy
under the Loan  Documents.  The  remedies  provided  in the Loan  Documents  are
cumulative  and not  exclusive of any  remedies  provided by law. The Lender may
comply with any applicable  state or federal law requirements in connection with
a  disposition  of the  Collateral  and such  compliance  will not be considered
adversely to affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral.

Section 8.2  Amendments,  Etc. No amendment,  modification,  termination or
waiver of any  provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by the
Borrower  therefrom  or any release of a Security  Interest  shall be  effective
unless  the same shall be in writing  and  signed by the  Lender,  and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the
specific  purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any
case shall  entitle  the  Borrower  to any other or further  notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances.

Section 8.3 Notices;  Communication of Confidential  Information;  Requests
for Accounting.  Except as otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,  all notices,
requests, demands and other communications provided for under the Loan Documents
shall be in writing  and shall be (a)  personally  delivered,  (b) sent by first
class United States mail, (c) sent by overnight courier of national  reputation,
(d)  transmitted  by  telecopy,  or (e) sent as  electronic  mail,  in each case
delivered  or sent to the party to whom  notice is being  given to the  business
address,  telecopier  number,  or e mail  address  set forth  below  next to its
signature  or, as to each  party,  at such other  business  address,  telecopier
number, or e mail address as it may hereafter  designate in writing to the other
party pursuant to the terms of this Section. All such notices, requests, demands
and  other  communications  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  authenticated  record
communicated or given on (a) the date received if personally delivered, (b) when
deposited  in the mail if  delivered  by mail,  (c) the  date  delivered  to the
courier if delivered by overnight  courier,  or (d) the date of  transmission if
sent by telecopy or by e mail, except that notices or requests  delivered to the
Lender  pursuant to any of the  provisions  of Article II shall not be effective
until  received by the Lender.  All  notices,  financial  information,  or other
business  records sent by either  party to this  Agreement  may be  transmitted,
sent,  or otherwise  communicated  via such medium as the sending party may deem
appropriate and commercially reasonable;  provided,  however, that the risk that
the confidentiality or privacy of such notices, financial information,  or other
business  records  sent by  either  party  may be  compromised  shall  be  borne
exclusively by the Borrower.  All requests for an accounting under Section 9-210
of the UCC (i) shall be made in a writing  signed by a Person  authorized  under
Section  2.2(b),  (ii) shall be  personally  delivered,  sent by  registered  or
certified mail,  return receipt  requested,  or by overnight courier of national
reputation,  (iii)  shall be deemed to be sent when  received  by the Lender and
(iv) shall otherwise  comply with the  requirements of Section 9-210 of the UCC.
The Borrower  requests  that the Lender  respond to all such  requests  which on
their face appear to come from an authorized  individual and releases the Lender
from any  liability  for so  responding.  The Borrower  shall pay the Lender the
maximum amount allowed by law for responding to such requests.

Section 8.4 Further Documents. The Borrower will from time to time execute,
deliver, endorse and authorize the filing of any and all instruments, documents,
conveyances,  assignments,  security agreements,  financing statements,  control
agreements  and other  agreements  and writings  that the Lender may  reasonably
request in order to secure, protect, perfect or enforce the Security Interest or
the  Lender's  rights  under the Loan  Documents  (but any failure to request or
assure that the Borrower executes,  delivers,  endorses or authorizes the filing
of any such  item  shall  not  affect or impair  the  validity,  sufficiency  or
enforceability  of the Loan Documents and the Security  Interest,  regardless of
whether  any such  item was or was not  executed,  delivered  or  endorsed  in a
similar context or on a prior occasion).

Section 8.5 Costs and Expenses.  The Borrower shall pay on demand all costs
and expenses,  including  reasonable  attorneys' fees, incurred by the Lender in
connection with the Indebtedness,  this Agreement,  the Loan Documents,  and any
other  document or agreement  related  hereto or thereto,  and the  transactions
contemplated  hereby,  including  all such costs,  expenses and fees incurred in
connection   with   the   negotiation,    preparation,   execution,   amendment,
administration,  performance, collection and enforcement of the Indebtedness and
all such  documents and  agreements  and the creation,  perfection,  protection,
satisfaction, foreclosure or enforcement of the Security Interest.

Section 8.6 Indemnity.  In addition to the payment of expenses  pursuant to
Section 8.5, the Borrower shall indemnify,  defend and hold harmless the Lender,
and  any of its  participants,  parent  corporations,  subsidiary  corporations,
affiliated  corporations,  successor  corporations,  and all  present and future
officers,  directors,  employees,  attorneys  and agents of the  foregoing  (the
"Indemnitees") from and against any of the following (collectively, "Indemnified
Liabilities"):

(i)  Any and all transfer  taxes,  documentary  taxes,  assessments or
charges  made by any  governmental  authority  by  reason  of the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents or the making of the
Advances;

(ii) Any  claims,  loss or  damage  to  which  any  Indemnitee  may be
subjected if any  representation or warranty contained in Section
5.14 proves to be  incorrect in any respect or as a result of any
violation of the covenant contained in Section 6.12(b) ; and

(iii) Any and  all  other  liabilities,  losses,  damages,  penalties,
judgments,  suits,  claims,  costs  and  expenses  of any kind or
nature   whatsoever    (including   the   reasonable   fees   and
disbursements  of counsel) in  connection  with the foregoing and
any other investigative,  administrative or judicial proceedings,
whether  or not  such  Indemnitee  shall  be  designated  a party
thereto, which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against
any such  Indemnitee,  in any manner related to or arising out of
or in  connection  with the making of the  Advances  and the Loan
Documents  or the  use or  intended  use of the  proceeds  of the
Advances.

If  any  investigative,  judicial  or  administrative  proceeding
arising  from  any  of  the  foregoing  is  brought  against  any
Indemnitee,  upon such  Indemnitee's  request,  the Borrower,  or
counsel  designated  by  the  Borrower  and  satisfactory  to the
Indemnitee,   will  resist  and  defend  such  action,   suit  or
proceeding  to  the  extent  and in the  manner  directed  by the
Indemnitee,  at the  Borrower's  sole  costs  and  expense.  Each
Indemnitee  will use its best efforts to cooperate in the defense
of  any  such  action,  suit  or  proceeding.  If  the  foregoing
undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless may be held to
be  unenforceable  because it violates any law or public  policy,
the Borrower shall nevertheless make the maximum  contribution to
the  payment  and   satisfaction   of  each  of  the  Indemnified
Liabilities  which  is  permissible  under  applicable  law.  The
Borrower's  obligations  under this Section 8.6 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the discharge of the Borrower's
other obligations hereunder.

Section 8.7 Participants.  The Lender and its participants, if any, are not
partners or joint  venturers,  and the Lender  shall not have any  liability  or
responsibility  for any obligation,  act or omission of any of its participants.
All rights and powers specifically  conferred upon the Lender may be transferred
or delegated to any of the Lender's participants, successors or assigns.

Section  8.8  Execution  in  Counterparts;  Telefacsimile  Execution.  This
Agreement   and  other  Loan   Documents  may  be  executed  in  any  number  of
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original and all of which counterparts,  taken together, shall constitute but
one and  the  same  instrument.  Delivery  of an  executed  counterpart  of this
Agreement  or any other  Loan  Document  by  telefacsimile  shall be  equally as
effective as delivery of an original  executed  counterpart of this Agreement or
such other Loan Document.  Any party delivering an executed  counterpart of this
Agreement  or any other Loan  Document by  telefacsimile  also shall  deliver an
original executed  counterpart of this Agreement or such other Loan Document but
the failure to deliver an  original  executed  counterpart  shall not affect the
validity,  enforceability,  and binding  effect of this  Agreement or such other
Loan Document.

Section 8.9  Retention  of  Borrower's  Records.  The Lender  shall have no
obligation  to maintain  any  electronic  records or any  documents,  schedules,
invoices,  agings, or other papers delivered to the Lender by the Borrower or in
connection  with the Loan  Documents  for more than 30 days after receipt by the
Lender. If there is a special need to retain specific records, the Borrower must
inform the Lender of its need to retain those records with particularity,  which
must be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 8.3 within
30 days of the Lender taking control of same.

Section  8.10  Binding  Effect;  Assignment;  Complete  Agreement;  Sharing
Information.  The Loan Documents  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the  Borrower  and the Lender and their  respective  successors  and assigns,
except  that the  Borrower  shall  not  have the  right  to  assign  its  rights
thereunder or any interest  therein without the Lender's prior written  consent.
To the extent  permitted by law, the Borrower waives and will not assert against
any assignee any claims,  defenses or set-offs  which the Borrower  could assert
against  the  Lender.  This  Agreement  shall also bind all Persons who become a
party to this Agreement as a borrower.  This  Agreement,  together with the Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior  agreements,  written or oral, on
the subject  matter  hereof.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement
contradicts  other  provisions  of the  Loan  Documents,  this  Agreement  shall
control.  Without limiting the Lender's right to share information regarding the
Borrower and its Affiliates with the Lender's participants, accountants, lawyers
and other advisors,  the Lender and each direct and indirect subsidiary of Wells
Fargo & Company may share with each other any information  that they may have in
their  possession  regarding the Borrower and its  Affiliates,  and the Borrower
waives any right of confidentiality it may have with respect to all such sharing
of information.

Section 8.11  Severability  of Provisions.  Any provision of this Agreement
which is prohibited or unenforceable  shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability  without  invalidating the remaining  provisions
hereof.

Section 8.12 Headings.  Article,  Section and  subsection  headings in this
Agreement are included  herein for  convenience  of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

Section 8.13 Cross Guaranty; Subordination.

(a)  Guaranty.  Each  Borrower  hereby agrees that such Borrower is jointly
and severally  liable for, and hereby  absolutely and  unconditionally
guarantees to Lender,  the full and prompt payment  (whether at stated
maturity,  by  acceleration  or  otherwise)  and  performance  of, all
Indebtedness owed or hereafter owing to Lender by each other Borrower.
Each  Borrower  agrees that its  guaranty  obligation  hereunder  is a
continuing  guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection,
that its obligations  under this Section shall not be discharged until
payment and  performance,  in full, of the  Indebtedness has occurred,
and that its  obligations  under this  Section  shall be absolute  and
unconditional, irrespective of, and unaffected by:

(1)  the  genuineness,  validity,  regularity,  enforceability  or any
future amendment of, or change in, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement,  document or instrument to which
any Borrower is or may become a party;

(2)  the absence of any action to enforce  this  Agreement  (including
this Section) or any other Loan Document or the waiver or consent
by Lender with respect to any of the provisions thereof;

(3)  the  existence,  value or condition of, or failure to perfect its
security  interest  in or  lien  against,  any  security  for the
Indebtedness  or any action,  or the  absence of any  action,  by
Lender in  respect  thereof  (including  the  release of any such
security);

(4)  the insolvency of any Borrower or Guarantor; or

(5)  any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute
a  legal  or  equitable  discharge  or  defense  of a  surety  or
guarantor.

Each Borrower shall be regarded, and shall be in the same position, as
principal debtor with respect to the Indebtedness guaranteed hereunder.

(b)  Waivers by Borrower.  Each Borrower expressly waives all rights it may
have now or in the future under any  statute,  or at common law, or at
law or in equity,  or otherwise,  to subrogation,  to compel Lender to
marshal assets or to proceed in respect of the Indebtedness guaranteed
hereunder against any other Borrower or Guarantor,  any other party or
against  any  security  for  the  payment  and   performance   of  the
Indebtedness   before  proceeding   against,  or  as  a  condition  to
proceeding  against,  such Borrower.  It is agreed among each Borrower
and  Lender  that the  foregoing  waivers  are of the  essence  of the
transaction   contemplated  by  this  Agreement  and  the  other  Loan
Documents  and that,  but for the  provisions of this Section and such
waivers, the Lender would decline to enter into this Agreement.

(c)  Benefit of Guaranty.  Each Borrower agrees that the provisions of this
Section  are  for  the  benefit  of the  Lender  and  its  successors,
transferees, endorsees and assigns, and nothing herein contained shall
impair, as between any other Borrower and the Lender,  the obligations
of such other Borrower under the Loan Documents.

(d)  Election of Remedies. If the Lender may, under applicable law, proceed
to realize its benefits under any of the Loan Documents  giving Lender
a security  interest in or lien upon any Collateral,  whether owned by
any Borrower or by any Guarantor, either by judicial foreclosure or by
non-judicial sale or enforcement,  the Lender may, at its sole option,
determine  which of its  remedies  or  rights  it may  pursue  without
affecting any of its rights and remedies  under this  Section.  If, in
the exercise of any of its rights and  remedies,  Lender shall forfeit
any of its  rights  or  remedies,  including  its  right  to  enter  a
deficiency  judgment  against  any  Borrower  or any other  Guarantor,
whether  because of any  applicable  laws  pertaining  to "election of
remedies" or the like, each Borrower hereby consents to such action by
Lender and waives any claim based upon such  action.  Any  election of
remedies  that  results  in the denial or  impairment  of the right of
Lender to seek a deficiency  judgment  against any Borrower  shall not
impair any other  Borrower's  obligation to pay the full amount of the
Indebtedness.  In the event  Lender  shall bid at any  foreclosure  or
trustee's  sale or at any private  sale  permitted  by law or the Loan
Documents,  Lender  may  bid  all  or  less  than  the  amount  of the
Indebtedness and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Lender but
shall  be  credited  against  the  Indebtedness.  The  amount  of  the
successful bid at any such sale,  whether Lender or any other party is
the successful  bidder,  shall be  conclusively  deemed to be the fair
market value of the  Collateral  and the  difference  between such bid
amount  and  the  remaining  balance  of  the  Indebtedness  shall  be
conclusively  deemed to be the amount of the  Indebtedness  guaranteed
under this Section,  notwithstanding that any present or future law or
court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of
any deficiency  claim to which Lender might  otherwise be entitled but
for such bidding at any such sale.

(e)  Liability  Cumulative.  The  liability  of each  Borrower  under  this
Section  8.13 is in  addition  to and  shall  be  cumulative  with all
liabilities  of each  Borrower to Lender under this  Agreement and the
other Loan  Documents to which such  Borrower is a party or in respect
of any  Indebtedness or obligation of the other Borrower,  without any
limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing
or  creating  such  other  liability   specifically  provides  to  the
contrary.

(f)  Subordination.

(1)  Each Borrower  covenants and agrees that during a Default  Period
the payment of all indebtedness,  principal,  interest (including
interest  which  accrues  after the  commencement  of any case or
proceeding  in  bankruptcy,  or  for  the  reorganization  of any
Borrower or Guarantor), fees, charges, expenses,  attorneys' fees
and any other sum,  obligation  or  liability  owing by any other
Borrower to such Borrower,  including any  intercompany  loans or
trade  payables or royalty or licensing fees  (collectively,  the
"Intercompany Obligations"),  is subordinated,  to the extent and
in the manner  provided  in this  Section  8.13(f),  to the prior
payment  in  full  of  all  Indebtedness   (herein,  the  "Senior
Obligations")  and that the  subordination  is for the benefit of
the Lender, and Lender may enforce such provisions directly.

(2)  Each Borrower  executing  this  Agreement  hereby (i)  authorizes
Lender  to  demand  specific  performance  of the  terms  of this
Section  8.13(f),  whether or not any other  Borrower  shall have
complied with any of the provisions  hereof  applicable to it, at
any time when such Borrower  shall have failed to comply with any
provisions  of this Section 8.13 which are  applicable  to it and
(ii)  irrevocably  waives any defense  based on the adequacy of a
remedy at law, which might be asserted as a bar to such remedy of
specific performance.

(3)  Upon  any   distribution   of  assets  of  any  Borrower  in  any
dissolution,  winding up, liquidation or reorganization  (whether
in bankruptcy,  insolvency or receivership proceedings or upon an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise):

(i)  The Lender  shall first be  entitled  to receive  payment in
full in cash of the Senior  Obligations  before any Borrower
is  entitled  to  receive  any  payment  on  account  of the
Intercompany Obligations.

(ii) Any payment or distribution of assets of any Borrower of any
kind or character,  whether in cash, property or securities,
to which any other Borrower would be entitled except for the
provisions of this Section 8.13(f)(3),  shall be paid by the
liquidating  trustee or agent or other  person  making  such
payment  or  distribution  directly  to the  Lender,  to the
extent  necessary  to make  payment  in  full of all  Senior
Obligations  remaining  unpaid  after  giving  effect to any
concurrent payment or distribution or provisions therefor to
the Lender.

(iii) In the event that  notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Section  8.13(f)(3),  any payment or distribution of
assets of any Borrower of any kind or character,  whether in
cash, property or securities, shall be received by any other
Borrower on account of the Intercompany  Obligations  before
all Senior  Obligations  are paid in full,  such  payment or
distribution  shall be  received  and held in trust  for and
shall be paid  over to the  Lender  for  application  to the
payment  of the Senior  Obligations  until all of the Senior
Obligations  shall  have  been  paid in full,  after  giving
effect  to  any  concurrent   payment  or   distribution  or
provision therefor to the Lender.

No right of the Lender or any other present or future holders of any Senior
Obligations to enforce the subordination  provisions herein shall at any time in
any way be  prejudiced  or  impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of
any Borrower or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder,
or by any noncompliance by any Borrower with the terms hereof, regardless of any
knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.

Section 8.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction,  Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. The
Loan  Documents  shall be  governed  by and  construed  in  accordance  with the
substantive  laws  (other  than  conflict  laws) of the State of New  York.  The
parties hereto hereby (i) consent to the personal  jurisdiction of the state and
federal  courts  located  in the  State  of New  York  in  connection  with  any
controversy related to this Agreement; (ii) waive any argument that venue in any
such forum is not convenient;  (iii) agree that any litigation  initiated by the
Lender or the  Borrower  in  connection  with this  Agreement  or the other Loan
Documents  may be venued in either  the state or federal  courts  located in the
City of New  York,  New York  County,  New  York;  and (iv)  agree  that a final
judgment in any such suit,  action or proceeding  shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other  jurisdictions  by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.

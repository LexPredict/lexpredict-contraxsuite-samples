(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
2.9, no Limited Liability Borrower shall have any obligation of contribution or
indemnity to any other Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.9 in an amount

(ii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that
is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding
Business Day; provided, that if any Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Rate
Loan would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day but is a day of
the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

(iii) any Interest Period with respect to a LIBOR Rate Loan that
begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there
is no numerically corresponding day in



19
<PAGE>   26

the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period) shall end on the last
Business Day of the relevant calendar month at the end of such Interest Period;

(iv) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Revolving Credit
Termination Date; provided, that if the Borrowers elect to term out the Loans
pursuant to Section 2.6(b), Interest Periods with respect to the Term-Out Amount
may be extended beyond the Revolving Credit Termination Date, so long as such
Interest Periods shall not extend beyond the Term-Out Maturity Date; and

(v) there shall be no more than five (5) Interest Periods
outstanding at any time.

(c)Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin provided for in
Section 3.1(a) with respect to the Loans (the "Applicable Margin") shall:

(i) for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on
the date immediately preceding the initial Adjustment Date (as
hereinafter defined) following the delivery of the financial
statements for the fiscal quarter ending September 29, 1996 and
the accompanying Officer's Compliance Certificate, be 0.75% in the
case of LIBOR Rate Loans and 0.00% in the case of Base Rate Loans;

(ii) for the period commencing on the initial Adjustment Date
following delivery of the financial statements for the fiscal
quarter ending September 29, 1996 and the accompanying Officer's
Compliance Certificate and ending on the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, be determined by reference to the Leverage Ratio
in accordance with the following chart:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

Applicable Margin Per Annum
Leverage Ratio                      Base Rate +     LIBOR Rate +
<S>                                     <C>            <C>
greater than or
equal to 2.75                           0.00%          1.25%

greater than or
equal to 2.25 but less
than 2.75                               0.00%          1.00%

less than 2.25                          0.00%          0.75%
</TABLE>


(iii) for the period commencing on the Revolving Credit
Termination Date and ending on the Term-Out Maturity Date,



20
<PAGE>   27

be equal to the sum of (A) the rate determined by reference to the
Leverage Ratio in accordance with the chart above plus (B) 0.25%.

Adjustments, if any, in the Applicable Margin shall be made by the Agent on the
tenth (10th) Business Day (the "Adjustment Date") after receipt by the Agent of
financial statements for Longhorn and its Subsidiaries delivered under Section
6.1(a) or (b), as applicable, and the accompanying Officer's Compliance
Certificate setting forth the Leverage Ratio of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries as
of the most recent fiscal quarter end. The Agent agrees to give the Borrowers
and the Lenders notice of any adjustment in the Applicable Margin within two (2)
Business Days of such adjustment; provided, that the Agent's failure to give
such notice shall not result in any liability to the Agent or in any way effect
the validity of any such adjustment. In the event Longhorn fails to deliver such
financial statements and certificate within the time required by Sections 6.1(a)
and 6.2 hereof, the Applicable Margin shall be the highest Applicable Margin set
forth above until the delivery of such financial statements and certificate
unless at such time the outstanding principal balance of the Loans are bearing
interest at the "default rate" set forth in Section 3.1(d) below in which case
the Applicable Margin shall not be increased pursuant to this sentence.

(d) Default Rate. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, (i) the Borrowers shall no longer have the option to request
LIBOR Rate Loans, (ii) all outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans shall bear interest at a
rate per annum two percent (2%) in excess of the rate then applicable to LIBOR
Rate Loans until the end of the applicable Interest Period and thereafter at a
rate equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate then applicable to Base
Rate Loans, and (iii) all outstanding Base Rate Loans shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to two percent (2%) in excess of the rate then applicable
to Base Rate Loans. Interest shall continue to accrue on the Notes after the
filing by or against any Borrower of any petition seeking any relief in
bankruptcy or under any act or law pertaining to insolvency or debtor relief,
whether state, federal or foreign.

(e) Interest Payment and Computation. Accrued and unpaid interest on
each Base Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each
calendar quarter commencing March 31, 1997; accrued and unpaid interest on each
LIBOR Rate Loan shall be payable on the last day of each Interest Period
applicable thereto, and if such Interest Period extends over three (3) months,
at the end of each three (3) month interval during such Interest Period. All
interest rates, fees and



21
<PAGE>   28


commissions provided hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
and assessed for the actual number of days elapsed.

(f) Maximum Rate. In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the
aggregate of all amounts deemed interest hereunder or under any of the Notes
charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to any
of the Notes exceed the highest rate permissible under any Applicable Law which
a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem
applicable hereto. In the event that such a court determines that the Lenders
have charged or received interest hereunder in excess of the highest applicable
rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically be reduced to the maximum
rate permitted by Applicable Law and the Lenders shall at the Agent's option
promptly refund to the Borrowers any interest received by Lenders in excess of
the maximum lawful rate or shall apply such excess to the principal balance of
the Obligations. It is the intent hereof that the Borrowers not pay or contract
to pay, and that neither the Agent nor any Lender receive or contract to
receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of
that which may be paid by the Borrowers under Applicable Law.

SECTION 3.2 Notice and Manner of Conversion or Continuation of Loans.
Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the
Borrowers shall have the option to (a) convert at any time all or any portion
of their outstanding Base Rate Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to
$1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof into one or more
LIBOR Rate Loans or (b) upon the expiration of any Interest Period, (i) convert
all or any part of their outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans in an aggregate principal
amount equal to $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof into
Base Rate Loans or (ii) continue such LIBOR Rate Loans as LIBOR Rate Loans.
Whenever the Borrowers desire to convert or continue Loans as provided above,
Longhorn, on behalf of the Borrowers, shall give the Agent irrevocable prior
written notice in the form attached as Exhibit D (a "Notice of Conversion/
Continuation") not later than 11:00 a.m. (Charlotte time) three (3) Business
Days before the day on which a proposed conversion or continuation of such Loan
is to be effective specifying (A) the Loans to be converted or continued, and,
in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loan to be converted or continued, the last day
of the Interest Period thereof, (B) the effective date of such conversion or
continuation (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the principal amount of such
Loans to be converted or continued, and (D) the Interest Period to be
applicable to such converted or continued LIBOR Rate Loan. The Agent shall
promptly notify the Lenders of such Notice of Conversion/Continuation.

SECTION 3.3 Fees.

(a) Commitment Fee. Commencing on the Closing Date, the Borrowers shall
pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, a non-refundable commitment
fee at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% on the average daily unused portion of
the Aggregate Commitment. The commitment fee shall be payable in arrears on the
last Business Day of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement
commencing March 31, 1997 and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Such
commitment fee shall be distributed by the Agent to the Lenders pro rata in
accordance with the Lenders' respective Commitment Percentages.

(b) Agent's and Other Fees. In order to compensate the Agent for
structuring and syndicating the Loans and for its obligations hereunder, the
Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent, for its account, the fees set forth in the
separate fee letter agreement executed by Longhorn dated October 30, 1996.

SECTION 3.4 Manner of Payment. Each payment by the Borrowers on
account of the principal of or interest on the Loans or of any fee, commission
or other amounts payable to the Lenders under this Agreement or any Note shall
be made not later than 1:00 p.m. (Charlotte time) on the date specified for
payment under this Agreement to the Agent at the Agent's Office for the account
of the Lenders (other than as set forth below) pro rata in accordance with
their respective Commitment Percentages, in Dollars, in immediately available
funds and shall be made without any set-off, counterclaim or deduction
whatsoever. Any payment received after such time but before 2:00 p.m.
(Charlotte time) on such day shall be deemed a payment on such date for the
purposes of Section 10.1, but for all other purposes shall be deemed to have
been made on the next succeeding Business Day. Any payment received after 2:00
p.m. (Charlotte time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding
Business Day for all purposes. Upon receipt by the Agent of each such payment,
the Agent shall distribute to each Lender at its address for notices set forth
herein its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with such Lender's
Commitment Percentage and shall wire advice of the amount of such credit to
each Lender. Each payment to the Agent of Agent's fees or expenses shall be
made for the account of the Agent and any amount payable to any Lender under
Sections 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 12.2 shall be paid to the Agent for the
account of the applicable Lender. Other than as set forth in Section 3.1(b), if
the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable for
the period of such extension.





23
<PAGE>   30

SECTION 3.5 Crediting of Payments and Proceeds. In the event that the
Borrowers shall fail to pay any of the Obligations when due and the Obligations
have been accelerated pursuant to Section 10.2, all payments received by the
Lenders upon the Notes and the other Obligations and all net proceeds from the
enforcement of the Obligations shall be applied first to all expenses then due
and payable by the Borrowers hereunder, then to all indemnity obligations then
due and payable by the Borrowers hereunder, then to all Agent's fees then due
and payable, then to all commitment and other fees and commissions then due and
payable, then to accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and any termination
payments due in respect of a Hedging Agreement with any Lender permitted
pursuant to Section 9.1 (pro rata in accordance with all such amounts due) and
then to the principal amount of the Notes.

SECTION 3.6 Adjustments. If any Lender (a "Benefitted Lender") shall
at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans or interest
thereon, or if any Lender shall at any time receive any collateral in respect
to its Loans (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by setoff or otherwise) in
a greater proportion than any such payment to and collateral received by any
other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans, or interest
thereon, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders
such portion of each such other Lender's Loans, or shall provide such other
Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as
shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment
or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders;
provided, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest. The Borrowers agree that each Lender so
purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans may exercise all rights of
payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such
portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

SECTION 3.7 Nature of Obligations of Lenders Regarding Loans;
Assumption by the Agent. The obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement to
make the Loans are several and are not joint or joint and several. Unless the
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to a proposed borrowing
date that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable
portion of the amount to be borrowed on such date (which notice shall not
release such Lender of its obligations hereunder), the Agent may assume that
such Lender has made such portion available




24
<PAGE>   31

to the Agent on the proposed borrowing date in accordance with Section 2.2(b)
and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrowers on such date a corresponding amount. If such amount is made available
to the Agent on a date after such borrowing date, such Lender shall pay to the
Agent on demand an amount, until paid, equal to the product of (a) the amount of
such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing, times (b) the daily
average Federal Funds Rate during such period as determined by the Agent, times
(c) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and
including such borrowing date to the date on which such Lender's Commitment
Percentage of such borrowing shall have become immediately available to the
Agent and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Agent with
respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error. If such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing is not
made available to the Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days of
such borrowing date, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount made
available by the Agent with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to
Base Rate Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrowers. The failure of any
Lender to make its Commitment Percentage of any Loan available shall not relieve
it or any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its
Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on such borrowing date, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its
Commitment Percentage of such Loan available on the borrowing date.

SECTION 3.8 Changed Circumstances.

(a) Circumstances Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability. If with respect to
any Interest Period the Agent shall reasonably determine that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the foreign exchange and interbank markets generally,
deposits in eurodollars, in the applicable amounts are not being quoted via
Telerate Page 3750 or offered to the Agent or any Lender for such Interest
Period, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrowers.
Thereafter, until the Agent notifies the Borrowers that such circumstances no
longer exist (which the Agent agrees to do; provided, that the Agent shall have
no liability for any failure to do so), the obligation of the Lenders to make
LIBOR Rate Loans and the right of the Borrowers to convert any Loan to or
continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be suspended, and the Borrowers
shall repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding
principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loans together with accrued interest
thereon, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such
LIBOR Rate Loan or convert the then



25
<PAGE>   32

outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan as
of the last day of such Interest Period.

(b) Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability. If, after the date hereof,
the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central
bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any of their respective Lending
Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall
make it unlawful or impossible for any of the Lenders (or any of their
respective Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or
maintain any LIBOR Rate Loan, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to
the Agent and the Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrowers and the
other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Agent notifies the Borrowers that such
circumstances no longer exist (which the Agent agrees to do; provided, that the
Agent shall have no liability for any failure to do so), (i) the obligations of
the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans and the right of the Borrowers to convert
any Loan or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be suspended and
thereafter the Borrowers may select only Base Rate Loans hereunder, and (ii) if
any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan to
the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto as a LIBOR Rate
Loan, the applicable LIBOR Rate Loan shall immediately be converted to a Base
Rate Loan for the remainder of such Interest Period.

(c) Increased Costs. If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or
any change in, any Applicable Law, or in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any of the
Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of such Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency:

(i) shall subject any of the Lenders (or any of their respective
Lending Offices) to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to any Note or
shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any of the Lenders (or any of
their respective Lending Offices) of the principal of or interest on any Note or
any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect thereof (except for
changes in the rate of or additional taxes imposed on or measured by the overall
net income of any of the Lenders or any of their respective Lending Offices
imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or is or should be
qualified to do business or such Lending Office is located); or




26
<PAGE>   33

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
(including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System but excluding any such reserve included in the definition
of Eurodollar Reserve Requirements), special deposit, insurance or capital or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
credit extended by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending
Offices) or shall impose on any of the Lenders (or any of their respective
Lending Offices) or the foreign exchange and interbank markets any other
condition affecting any Note;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the costs to any of the
Lenders of maintaining any LIBOR Rate Loan or to reduce the yield or amount of
any sum received or receivable by any of the Lenders under this Agreement or
under the Notes in respect of a LIBOR Rate Loan, then such Lender shall promptly
notify the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers of such fact
and demand compensation therefor and, within fifteen (15) days after such notice
by the Agent, the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or Lenders for such increased cost or
reduction. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrowers of any event occurring
after the Closing Date entitling such Lender to compensation under any of the
preceding subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable; provided, that
except as otherwise limited by the next sentence, the failure of any Lender to
give such notice shall not result in any liability to such Lender or release the
Borrowers from any of their obligations hereunder. A Lender shall only be
entitled to compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section
for events occurring during the 120-day period ending on the date the Borrowers
receive the notice described in the immediately preceding sentence. Such Lender
agrees to furnish to the Borrowers a certificate setting forth the basis and
amount of each request by such Lender for compensation under this Section, which
certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the matters stated therein.
Determinations by any Lender of the effect of any of the events described in
this subsection shall be made on a reasonable basis and in good faith, based
upon the assumption that such Lender funded its Commitment Percentage of the
LIBOR Rate Loans in the London interbank market, and using any reasonable
attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and
practical.

(d) Eurodollar Reserve Requirements. In the event that any Lender shall
determine at any time that by reason of Regulation D, such Lender is required to
maintain Eurodollar Reserve Requirements during any period that it has any LIBOR
Rate Loans



27
<PAGE>   34

outstanding, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers by written
notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) specifying the
additional amounts reasonably determined by the Lender to be required to
indemnify such Lender against the cost of maintaining such Eurodollar Reserve
Requirements (such written notice to provide a computation of such additional
amounts) and the Borrowers shall directly pay to such Lender such specified
amounts as additional interest.

SECTION 3.9 Indemnity. The Borrowers hereby indemnify each of the
Lenders against any loss or expense which may arise or be attributable to each
Lender's obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired
to effect, fund or maintain any Loan (a) as a consequence of any failure by the
Borrowers to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in
connection with a LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) due to any failure of the Borrowers to
borrow on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Continuation/Conversion or (c) due to any payment, prepayment or conversion of
any LIBOR Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period
therefor other than as a result of Section 3.8(b)(ii). Any Lender requesting
indemnification under this Section shall furnish to the Borrowers a certificate
setting forth the basis and amount of such request, which certificate shall be
prima facie evidence of the matters stated therein. Determinations by any
Lender of the amount of any claim for indemnification under this Section shall
be made on a reasonable basis and in good faith, based upon the assumption that
such Lender funded its Commitment Percentage of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the
London interbank market, and using any reasonable attribution or averaging
methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical.

SECTION 3.10 Capital Requirements. If either (a) the introduction of,
or any change in, or in the interpretation of, any Applicable Law or (b)
compliance with any guideline or request issued after the date hereof from any
central bank or comparable agency or other Governmental Authority (whether or
not having the force of law), has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on the capital of, or has affected or would affect the amount of
capital required to be maintained by, any Lender or any corporation controlling
such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to the Commitments and other
commitments of this type, below the rate which the Lender or such other
corporation could have achieved but for such introduction, change or
compliance, then within five (5) Business Days after written demand by any such
Lender, the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender from time to time as specified
by such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or other
corporation for such reduction. Any Lender requesting



28
<PAGE>   35

compensation under this Section shall furnish to the Borrowers a certificate
setting forth the basis and amount of such request, which certificate shall be
prima facie evidence of the matters stated therein. Determinations by any Lender
of the amount of any claim for compensation under this Section shall be made on
a reasonable basis and in good faith.

SECTION 3.11 Taxes.

(a) Payments Free and Clear. Any and all payments by the
Borrowers hereunder or under the Notes shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholding, and all liabilities with respect thereto
excluding, (i) in the case of each Lender and the Agent, income and franchise
taxes imposed by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the
Agent (as the case may be) is organized or is or should be qualified to do
business or any political subdivision thereof and (ii) in the case of each
Lender, income and franchise taxes imposed by the United States of America, any
political subdivision thereof, the jurisdiction of such Lender's Lending Office
or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter
referred to as "Taxes"). If the Borrowers shall be required by law to deduct any
Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any
Lender or the Agent, (A) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary
so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 3.11) such Lender or the Agent (as
the case may be) receives an amount equal to the amount such party would have
received had no such deductions been made, (B) the Borrowers shall make such
deductions, (C) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
taxing authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law, and (D)
the Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent evidence of such payment to the
relevant taxing authority or other authority in the manner provided in Section
3.11(d).

(b) Stamp and Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrowers shall
pay any present or future stamp, registration, recordation or documentary taxes
or any other similar fees or charges or excise or property taxes, levies of the
United States or any state or political subdivision thereof or any applicable
foreign jurisdiction which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement, the Loans, the other Loan Documents, or the perfection of any rights
or security interest in respect thereto (hereinafter referred to as "Other
Taxes").




29
<PAGE>   36

(c) Indemnity. The Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender and
the Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without
limitation, any Taxes and Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 3.11) paid by such Lender or the Agent (as the case
may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted. Such indemnification shall be made within thirty
(30) days from the date such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) makes
written demand therefor.

(d) Evidence of Payment. Within thirty (30) days after the
date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes, Longhorn, on behalf of the
Borrowers, shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section
12.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof
or other evidence of payment satisfactory to the Agent.

(e) Delivery of Tax Forms. Each Lender organized under the
laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof shall
deliver to the Borrowers, with a copy to the Agent, on the Closing Date or
concurrently with the delivery of the relevant Assignment and Acceptance, as
applicable, (i) two United States Internal Revenue Service Forms 4224 or Forms
1001, as applicable (or successor forms) properly completed and certifying in
each case that such Lender is entitled to a complete exemption from withholding
or deduction for or on account of any United States federal income taxes, and
(ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor applicable form,
as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup
withholding taxes. Each such Lender further agrees to deliver to the Borrowers,
with a copy to the Agent, a Form 1001 or 4224 and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor
applicable forms or manner of certification, as the case may be, on or before
the date that any such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence
of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by
it to the Borrowers, certifying in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224 that such
Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes (unless in any such case
an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation)
has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders such forms inapplicable or the exemption to which such
forms relate unavailable and such Lender notifies the Borrowers and the Agent
that it is not entitled to receive payments without deduction or withholding of
United States federal income taxes) and, in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9,
establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.



30
<PAGE>   37

(f) Survival. Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Borrowers contained in this Section 3.11 shall survive the payment in full of
the Obligations and the termination of the Commitments.

(g) Change of Lending Office, etc. Any Lender claiming
additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.11 shall use reasonable
efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to file any certificate or document requested by the Borrowers or
to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if the making of such filing or
change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such additional
amounts which may thereafter accrue and would not, in the judgment of such
Lender, be disadvantageous to such Lender.

(h) Tax Credits. In the event that an additional payment is
made under Section 3.11(a) or (c) for the account of any Lender and such Lender
receives or is granted a credit against or release or remission for, or
repayment of, any tax paid or payable by it in respect of or calculated with
reference to the deduction or withholding giving rise to such payment, such
Lender shall, to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to the retention
of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the
Borrowers such amount as is attributable to such deduction or withholding as
will leave such Lender (after such payment) in no better or worse position than
it would have been in if the Borrowers had not been required to make such
deduction or withholding.

SECTION 3.12 Affected Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation
pursuant to Section 3.8(c), 3.8(d), 3.10 or 3.11, or the obligation of the
Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or to continue, or to convert Base Rate Loans
into, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.8(a) or (b) due
to an event affecting any Lender, then, so long as there does not then exist
any Default or Event of Default, the Borrowers may either (a) demand that such
Lender (the "Affected Lender"), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall
promptly, assign its Commitment to another financial institution subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.10(b) for a purchase price
equal to the aggregate principal balance of Loans then owing to the Affected

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BORROWERS

SECTION 5.1 Representations and Warranties. To induce the Agent to
enter into this Agreement and the Lenders to make the Loans, the Borrowers
hereby represent and warrant to the Agent and Lenders that:

(a) Organization; Power; Qualification. Each of Longhorn and
its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, has the power
and authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being
and hereafter proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified and authorized to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or the
nature of its business requires such qualification and authorization, except
where the failure to so qualify could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The jurisdictions in which Longhorn and its
Subsidiaries are organized and qualified to do business as of the Closing Date
are described on Schedule 5.1 (a).

(b) Ownership. Each Subsidiary of Longhorn as of the Closing
Date is listed on Schedule 5.1 (a). The capitalization of Longhorn and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date consists of the number of shares,
authorized, issued and outstanding, of such classes and series, with or without
par value, (or in the case of Subsidiaries which are not corporations,
comparable information regarding equity interests therein) described on Schedule
5.1(a). All outstanding shares or other equity interests have been duly
authorized and validly issued and, with respect to capital stock, are fully paid
and nonassessable. The holders of the capital stock or other equity interests of
the Subsidiaries of Longhorn as of the Closing Date and the amount of capital
stock or other equity interest owned by each as of the Closing Date are
described on Schedule 5.1(a). As of the Closing Date, there are no outstanding
stock purchase warrants, subscriptions, options, securities, instruments or
other rights of any type or nature



36
<PAGE>   43

whatsoever, which are convertible into, exchangeable for or otherwise provide
for or permit the issuance of capital stock or other equity interest of Longhorn
or its Subsidiaries, except as described on Schedule 5.1(a).

(c) Authorization of Agreement, Loan Documents and Borrowing. Each of
Longhorn and its Subsidiaries has the right, power and authority and has taken
all necessary corporate and other action to authorize the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents to which
it is a party in accordance with their respective terms. This Agreement and each
of the other Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the duly
authorized officers of Longhorn and each of its Subsidiaries party thereto, and
each such document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Longhorn or its Subsidiary party thereto, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar state or federal debtor relief laws from
time to time in effect which affect the enforcement of creditors' rights in
general and the availability of equitable remedies.

(d) Compliance of Agreement, Loan Documents and Borrowing with Laws,
Etc. The execution, delivery and performance by Longhorn and its Subsidiaries of
the Loan Documents to which each such Person is a party, in accordance with
their respective terms, the borrowings hereunder and the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not, by the passage of time, the giving of
notice or otherwise, (i) require any Governmental Approval or violate any
Applicable Law relating to Longhorn or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict
with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under the articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of Longhorn or any of
its Subsidiaries or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such
Person is a party or by which any of its properties may be bound or any
Governmental Approval relating to such Person, or (iii) result in or require the
creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property now
owned or hereafter acquired by such Person other than Liens arising under the
Loan Documents.

(e) Compliance with Law; Governmental Approvals. Each of Longhorn and
its Subsidiaries (i) has all Governmental Approvals required by any Applicable
Law for it to conduct its business, each of which is in full force and effect,
is final and not subject to review on appeal and is not the subject of any
pending or, to the best of its knowledge, threatened attack by direct or
collateral proceeding, except for such Governmental Approvals the absence of
which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) is in compliance with



37
<PAGE>   44

each Governmental Approval applicable to it and in compliance with all other
Applicable Laws relating to it or any of its respective properties, except in
each case where the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(f) Tax Returns and Payments. Each of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries has
duly filed or caused to be filed all material federal, state, local and other
tax returns required by Applicable Law to be filed, and has paid, or made
adequate provision for the payment of, all material federal, state, local and
other taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies upon it and its
property, income, profits and assets which are due and payable except any
nonpayment permitted under Section 7.5. No Governmental Authority has asserted
any Lien or other material claim against Longhorn or any Subsidiary thereof with
respect to unpaid taxes which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of Longhorn and
its Subsidiaries in respect of federal, state, local and other taxes for all
Fiscal Years and portions thereof since the organization of Longhorn and its
Subsidiaries are in the judgment of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries adequate, and
the Borrowers do not anticipate any additional taxes or assessments for any of
such years, the result of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(g) Intellectual Property Matters. Except for matters existing on the
Closing Date and set forth on Schedule 5.1(g), each of Longhorn and its
Subsidiaries owns or possesses rights to use all franchises, licenses,
copyrights, copyright applications, patents, patent rights or licenses, patent
applications, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights,
copyrights and rights with respect to the foregoing which are required to
conduct its business, except where the failure to so own or possess such rights
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No event has
occurred which permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would permit,
the revocation or termination of any such rights, and except for matters
existing on the Closing Date and set forth on Schedule 5.1(g), neither Longhorn
nor any Subsidiary thereof is liable to any Person for infringement under
Applicable Law with respect to any such rights as a result of its business
operations, the result of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(h) Environmental Matters. Except for matters which, individually or in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect,




38
<PAGE>   45

(i) The properties of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries do not contain, and

39
<PAGE>   46

under applicable Environmental Laws.

(i) ERISA. Except for matters which, individually or in the aggregate,
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect:

(i) As of the Closing Date, no Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate

Section 401(a) of the Code other than those identified on Schedule 5.1(i);

all material respects with all applicable provisions of ERISA and the

(vii)No Borrower has engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction
described in ERISA Section 406 or Code Section 4975.

(j) Margin Stock. Neither Longhorn nor any Subsidiary thereof is
engaged principally or as one of its activities in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" (as each
such term is defined or used in Regulations G and U of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System). No part of the proceeds of any of the Loans will be
used for purchasing or carrying margin stock or for any purpose which violates,
or which would be inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation G, T, U or X
of such Board of Governors.

(k) Government Regulation. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.1(k),
neither Longhorn nor any Subsidiary thereof is an "investment company" or a
company "controlled" by an "investment company" (as each such term is defined or
used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) and neither Longhorn nor
any Subsidiary thereof is, or after giving effect to any Loan will be, subject
to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 or the
Interstate Commerce Act, each as amended, or any other Applicable Law which
limits its ability to incur or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(l) Material Contracts. Schedule 5.1(l) sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all Material Contracts of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the Closing Date not listed on any other Schedule hereto; other
than as set forth in Schedule 5.1(l), each such Material Contract is, and after
giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Loan

thereof. Longhorn and its Subsidiaries have delivered to the Agent a true and
complete copy of each Material Contract required to be listed on Schedule
5.1(l).

(m) Employee Relations. Each of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries has an
adequate work force in place and is not, as



41
<PAGE>   48

of the Closing Date, party to any collective bargaining agreement nor has any
labor union been recognized as the representative of its employees. The
Borrowers know of no pending, threatened or contemplated strikes, work stoppage
or other collective labor disputes involving their employees or the employees of
their Subsidiaries.

(n) Burdensome Provisions. Neither Longhorn nor any Subsidiary thereof
is a party to any indenture, agreement, lease or other instrument, or subject to
any corporate or partnership restriction, Governmental Approval or Applicable
Law which is so unusual or burdensome as in the foreseeable future could be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Longhorn and its
Subsidiaries do not presently anticipate that future expenditures needed to meet
the provisions of any statutes, orders, rules or regulations of a Governmental
Authority will be so burdensome as to have a Material Adverse Effect.

of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and the related
statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the Fiscal Year

Subsidiaries as of September 29, 1996 and related unaudited interim statements
of income and retained earnings, copies of which have been furnished to the
Agent and each Lender, are complete and correct and fairly present in all
material respects, the assets, liabilities and financial position of Longhorn
and its Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the results of the operations and
changes of financial position for the periods then ended. All such financial
statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Longhorn and its Subsidiaries have no Debt,
obligation or other unusual forward or long-term commitment which is not fairly
reflected in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes thereto.

(p) No Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 1995 (and with
reference back to such date only) there has been no material adverse change in
the properties, business, operations, prospects, or condition (financial or
otherwise) of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and no event has
occurred or condition arisen that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(q) Solvency. As of the Closing Date and after giving effect to each
Loan made hereunder, Longhorn and each of its Subsidiaries will be Solvent.


<PAGE>   49

(r) Titles to Properties. Each of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries has
such title to the real property owned by it as is necessary or desirable to the
conduct of its business and valid and legal title to all of its personal
property and assets, including, but not limited to, those reflected on the
balance sheets of Longhorn and its Subsidiaries delivered pursuant to Section
5.1(o), except those which have been disposed of by Longhorn or its Subsidiaries
subsequent to such date which dispositions have been in the ordinary course of
business or as otherwise expressly permitted hereunder.

(s) Liens. None of the properties and assets of Longhorn or any
Subsidiary thereof is subject to any Lien, except Liens permitted pursuant to
Section 9.3. No financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code of any
state which names Longhorn or any Subsidiary thereof or any of their respective
trade names or divisions as debtor and which has not been terminated, has been
filed in any state or other jurisdiction and neither Longhorn nor any Subsidiary
thereof has signed any such financing statement or any security agreement
authorizing any secured party thereunder to file any such financing statement,
except to perfect those Liens permitted by Section 9.3 hereof.

(t) Debt and Contingent Obligations. Schedule 5.1(t) is a complete and
correct listing of all Debt and Contingent Obligations as of the Closing Date of
Longhorn and its Subsidiaries in excess of $250,000. Longhorn and its
Subsidiaries have performed and are in material compliance with all of the terms
of such Debt and Contingent Obligations and all instruments and agreements
relating thereto.

(u) Litigation. Except for matters existing on the Closing Date and
set forth on Schedule 5.1(u), there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending
nor, to the knowledge of the Borrowers, threatened against or in any other way
relating adversely to or affecting Longhorn or any Subsidiary thereof or any of
their respective properties in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or
before or by any Governmental Authority which, if adversely determined,
individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(v) Absence of Defaults. No event has occurred or is continuing which
(i) constitutes a Default or an Event of Default, or (ii) constitutes, or which
with the passage of time or giving of notice or both would constitute, a default
or event of default by Longhorn or any Subsidiary thereof under any Material
Contract or judgment, decree or order to which Longhorn or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Longhorn or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties may be bound, which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material

43
<PAGE>   50

Adverse Effect or which would require Longhorn or any of its Subsidiaries to
make any payment thereunder in excess of $250,000 prior to the scheduled
maturity date therefor.

(w) Accuracy and Completeness of Information. All written information,
reports and other papers and data produced by or on behalf of Longhorn or any
Subsidiary thereof and furnished to the Lenders were, at the time the same were
so furnished, complete and correct in all material respects to the extent
necessary to give the recipient a true and accurate knowledge of the subject
matter. No document furnished or written statement made to the Agent or the
Lenders by Longhorn or any Subsidiary thereof in connection with the
negotiation, preparation or execution of this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents contains or will contain any untrue statement of a fact material to
the creditworthiness of Longhorn or any of its Subsidiaries or omits or will
omit to state a fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein
not materially misleading. Longhorn and its Subsidiaries are not aware of any
events or circumstances which they have not disclosed in writing to the Agent
having a Material Adverse Effect, or insofar as the Borrowers can now foresee,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 5.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties, Etc. All
representations and warranties set forth in this Article V and all
representations and warranties of the Borrowers or any of their respective
Subsidiaries contained in any certificate, or any of the Loan Documents
(including but not limited to any such representation or warranty made in or in
connection with any amendment thereto) shall constitute representations and
warranties made under this Agreement. All representations and warranties made
under this Agreement shall be made or deemed to be made at and as of the
Closing Date, shall survive the Closing Date and shall not be waived by the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Lenders or any borrowing hereunder.

manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties made by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any officer
thereof contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for
in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or
for any failure of any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agent shall not be under any
obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Borrower or
any of their respective Subsidiaries.

SECTION 11.4 Reliance by the Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing,

<PAGE>   72

teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by

Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including,
without limitation, counsel to the Borrowers), independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Agent. The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any
Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless such Note shall have been
transferred in accordance with Section 12.10 hereof. The Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Lenders (or, when expressly required hereby or by the relevant
other Loan Document, all the Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first
be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, under this Agreement and the Notes in accordance with a request of the
Required Lenders (or, when expressly required hereby, all the Lenders), and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

SECTION 11.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless it has received notice from a Lender or the Borrowers
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, it shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders.
The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, that
unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

SECTION 11.6 Non-Reliance on the Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact, Subsidiaries or
Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by
the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Longhorn or
any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent that
it has,




66
<PAGE>   73

independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Longhorn and its
Subsidiaries and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter
into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
Longhorn and its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other documents
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder or by
the other Loan Documents, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any

any of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact,
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

SECTION 11.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent
in its capacity as such and (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and
without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), ratably according
to the respective amounts of their Commitment Percentages, from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which
may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the
payment of the Notes) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent
in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted
by the Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, that
no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the Agent's bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 11.7 shall
survive the payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder and
the termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 11.8 The Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates may make




67
<PAGE>   74

loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrowers as though the Agent were not an Agent hereunder. With respect to
any Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the Agent shall have
the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as
any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the
terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.

SECTION 11.9 Resignation of the Agent; Successor Agent. Subject to
the appointment and acceptance of a successor as provided below, the Agent may

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint
a successor Agent, which successor shall have minimum capital and surplus of at
least $500,000,000. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30)
days after the Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which successor shall have
minimum capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring
Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 11.9
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

jurisdiction. The panel from which all arbitrators are selected shall be
comprised of licensed attorneys. The single arbitrator selected for expedited
procedure shall be a retired judge from the highest court of general
jurisdiction, state or federal, of the state where the hearing will be
conducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph shall not apply to any
Hedging Agreement that is a Loan Document.

(b) Jury Trial. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
AGENT, EACH LENDER AND EACH BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE
RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, CLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER, OR THE
PERFORMANCE OF SUCH RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.

(c) Preservation of Certain Remedies. Notwithstanding the
preceding binding arbitration provisions, the parties hereto and to the other
Loan Documents preserve, without diminution, certain remedies that such Persons
may employ or exercise freely, either alone or in conjunction with or during a
Dispute. Each such Person shall have and hereby reserves the right to proceed in
any court of proper jurisdiction or by self help to exercise or prosecute the
following remedies: (i) all rights to foreclose against any real or personal
property or other security by exercising a power of sale granted in the Loan
Documents or under applicable law or by judicial foreclosure and sale, (ii) all
rights of self help including peaceful occupation of property and




72
<PAGE>   79

collection of rents, set off, and peaceful possession of property, (iii)
obtaining provisional or ancillary remedies including injunctive relief,
sequestration, garnishment, attachment, appointment of receiver and filing an
involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, and (iv) when applicable, a judgment by
confession of judgment. Preservation of these remedies does not limit the power
of an arbitrator to grant similar remedies that may be requested by a party in a
Dispute.

SECTION 12.7 Reversal of Payments. To the extent the Borrowers make a
payment or payments to the Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders or the
Agent receives any payment or proceeds of the collateral which payments or
proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a
trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal
law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or
proceeds repaid, the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall
be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or
proceeds had not been received by the Agent.

SECTION 12.8 Punitive Damages. The Agent, Lenders and Borrowers (on
behalf of themselves and their Subsidiaries) hereby agree that no such Person
shall have a remedy of punitive or exemplary damages against any other party to
a Loan Document and each such Person hereby waives any right or claim to
punitive or exemplary damages that they may now have or may arise in the future
in connection with any Dispute, whether such Dispute is resolved through
arbitration or judicially.

SECTION 12.9 Accounting Matters. All financial and accounting
calculations, measurements and computations made for any purpose relating to
this Agreement, including, without limitation, all computations utilized by
Longhorn or any Subsidiary thereof to determine compliance with any covenant
contained herein, shall, except as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby or
unless there is an express written direction by the Agent to the contrary
agreed to by Longhorn, be performed in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the
Closing Date. In the event that changes in GAAP shall be mandated by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, or any similar accounting body of
comparable standing, or shall be recommended by Longhorn's certified public
accountants, to the extent that such changes would modify such accounting terms
or the interpretation or computation thereof, such changes shall be followed in
defining such accounting terms only from and after the date the Borrowers and
the Lenders shall have amended this Agreement to the extent necessary to
reflect any such changes in the financial covenants and other terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the
Agent and the Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the
Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register
shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or Lender at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e) Issuance of New Notes. Upon its receipt of an Assignment
and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee together

Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the






75
<PAGE>   82

aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the
effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in
substantially the form of the assigned Notes delivered to the assigning Lender.
Each surrendered Note or Notes shall be canceled and returned to the Borrowers.

held by it for all purposes of this Agreement;

(v) the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement;

(vi) such Lender shall not permit such participant
the right to approve any waivers, amendments or other modifications to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document other than waivers, amendments or
modifications which would reduce the principal of or the interest rate on any
Loan, extend the term or increase the amount of the Commitment, reduce the
amount of any fees to which such participant is entitled, extend any scheduled
payment date for principal of any Loan or, except as expressly contemplated
hereby or thereby, release substantially all of the collateral securing the

assignment, participation or proposed participation pursuant to this Section

and other authorizations granted to the Lenders, the Agent and any Persons
designated by the Agent or any Lender pursuant to any provisions of this

termination of this Agreement, the indemnities to which the Agent and the

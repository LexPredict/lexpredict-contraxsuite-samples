(ii)     the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for any A
Borrowing to be made if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing
is less than $20,000,000;

(iii)     if any Bank shall, at least one Business Day before the date
of any requested A Borrowing to be made, notify the Agent that
the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation
of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any
central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it
is unlawful, for such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to
perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to fund Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, the
right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate Advances for
such A Borrowing or any subsequent A Borrowing shall be
suspended until such Bank shall notify the Agent that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and,
except as provided in Section 2.02(b)(vi), each Advance
comprising such A Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance;

(iv)     if the Majority Banks shall, on or before the date of any
requested A Borrowing to be made, notify the Agent that the
Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising such A
Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Banks
of making their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for such A
Borrowing, the right of the Borrower to select Eurodollar Rate
Advances for such A Borrowing or any subsequent A Borrowing
shall be suspended until the Agent, at the request of the
Majority Banks, shall notify the Borrower and the Banks that

and, except as provided in Section 2.02(b)(vi), each Advance
comprising such A Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance;

causing such suspension no longer exist, and,





<PAGE>   17
except as provided in Section 2.02(b)(vi), each Advance
comprising such A Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance;

(vi)     if the Borrower has requested a proposed A Borrowing
consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances and as a result of
circumstances referred to in Section 2.02(b)(iii), (iv) or (v)
such A Borrowing would not consist of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, the Borrower may, by notice given not later than
2:00 P.M. (Dallas time) at least one Business Day prior to the
date such proposed A Borrowing would otherwise be made, cancel
such A Borrowing, in which case such A Borrowing shall be
cancelled and no Advances shall be made as a result of such
requested A Borrowing, but the Borrower shall indemnify the
Banks in connection with such cancellation as contemplated by
Section 2.02(c); and

(vii)     if the Borrower shall fail to select the duration or
continuation of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate
Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the
definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01 and this
paragraph (b), the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower
and the Banks and such A Advances will be made available to
the Borrower on the date of such A Borrowing as Base Rate
Advances.

(c)     Each Notice of A Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on
the Borrower, except as set forth in Section 2.02(b)(vi).  In the case of any A
Borrowing requested by the Borrower which the related Notice of A Borrowing
specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall
indemnify each Bank against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as
a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such
Notice of A Borrowing for such A Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth
in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
reasonably anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to
fund the A Advance to be made by such Bank as part of such A Borrowing when
such A Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.  A
certificate in reasonable detail as to the basis for and the amount of such
loss, cost or expense submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such Bank
shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of such loss, cost or expense.  If
an A Borrowing requested by the Borrower which the related Notice of A
Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances is not made
as an A Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances as a result of Section
2.02(b), the Borrower shall indemnify each Bank against any loss (excluding
loss of profits), cost or expense incurred by such Bank by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank
(prior to the time such Bank is actually aware that such A Borrowing will not
be so made) to fund the A Advance to be made by such Bank as part of such A
Borrowing.  A certificate in reasonable detail as to the basis for and the
amount of such loss, cost or expense submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by
such Bank shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of such loss, cost or
expense.

(d)     Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior
to the date of any A Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the
Agent such Bank's ratable portion of such A Borrowing, the Agent may assume
that such Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such
A Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower
requesting such A Borrowing on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the
extent that such Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to
the Agent, such





<PAGE>   18
Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand
such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such amount
is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to A Advances comprising such A Borrowing and (ii) in
the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate.  If such Bank shall repay to the
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such
Bank's A Advance as part of such A Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

(e)     The failure of any Bank to make the A Advance to be made by it
as part of any A Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation,
if any, hereunder to make its A Advance on the date of such A Borrowing, but no
Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the A
Advance to be made by such other Bank on the date of any A Borrowing.

provided, however, that each partial prepayment pursuant to this Section
2.05(b) shall be in an aggregate principal





<PAGE>   19
amount not less than $5,000,000 and in an aggregate principal amount such that
after giving effect thereto no A Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances
shall have a principal amount outstanding of less than $5,000,000 and no A
Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances shall have a principal amount
outstanding of less than $20,000,000.

Section 2.06.  Interest on A Advances.  The Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each A Advance made by each Bank
from the date of such A Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in
full, at the following rates per annum:

(a)     Base Rate Advances.  If such A Advance is a Base Rate Advance,
a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such A
Advance to the Base Rate in effect from time to time during such Interest
Period for such A Advance, payable on the last day of such Interest Period.

(b)     Eurodollar Rate Advances.  If such A Advance is a Eurodollar
Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period
for such A Advance to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period
plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time for such A Advance,
payable on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period
has a duration of more than three months, on each day which occurs during such
Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period.

(c)     Additional Interest on Eurodollar Rate Advances.  The Borrower
shall pay to each Bank, so long as such Bank shall be required under
regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain
reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including
Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of
each Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Bank, from the date of such Advance until
such principal amount is paid in full, at an interest rate per annum equal at
all times to the remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the Eurodollar Rate for
the Interest Period for such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing
such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate
Reserve Percentage of such Bank for such Interest Period, payable on each date
on which interest is payable on such Advance.  Such additional interest shall
be determined by such Bank and notified to the Borrower through the Agent.  A
certificate as to the amount of such additional interest submitted to the
Borrower and the Agent by such Bank shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

Section 2.07.  Interest Rate Determination.  (a) Each Reference Bank
agrees to furnish to the Agent timely information for the purpose of
determining each Eurodollar Rate.  If any of the Reference Banks shall not
furnish such timely information to the Agent for the purpose of determining any
such Eurodollar Rate, the Agent shall determine such Eurodollar Rate on the
basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks, subject
to Section 2.02(b).

(b)     The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the
Banks of the applicable interest rate for such A Advance determined by the
Agent for purposes of Section 2.06(a) or (b), and the applicable rate, if any,
furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable
interest rate under Section 2.06(b).

Section 2.08.  The B Advances.  (a) Each Bank severally agrees that
the Borrower may make B Borrowings under this Section 2.08 from time to time on
any Business Day during the period from the date hereof until the date
occurring 30 days prior to the Termination Date in the manner set forth below;
provided that,





<PAGE>   20
following the making of each B Borrowing, the aggregate amount of the Advances
then outstanding shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of
the Banks (computed without regard to any B Reduction).

(i)     The Borrower may request a B Borrowing under this Section 2.08
by delivering to the Agent, not later than 9:00 A.M. (Dallas
time) at least five Business Days prior to the date of the
proposed B Borrowing, a notice of a B Borrowing (a "Notice of
B Borrowing"), in substantially the form of Exhibit B-2
hereto, specifying the date and aggregate amount of the
proposed B Borrowing, the maturity date for repayment of each
B Advance to be made as part of such B Borrowing (which
maturity date may not be earlier than the date occurring 14
days after the date of such B Borrowing or later than the
earlier of 6 months after the date of such B Borrowing or the
Termination Date), the interest payment date or dates relating
thereto, and any other terms to be applicable to such B
Borrowing (including, without limitation, the basis to be used
by the Banks in determining the rate or rates of interest to
be offered by them as provided in paragraph (ii) below and
prepayment terms, if any, but excluding any waiver or other
modification to any of the conditions set forth in Article
III).  The Borrower may not select a maturity date for any B
Borrowing which ends after the Termination Date.  The Agent
shall promptly notify each Bank of each request for a B
Borrowing received by it from the Borrower by sending such
Bank a copy of the related Notice of B Borrowing.

(ii)     Each Bank may, if in its sole discretion it elects to do so,
irrevocably offer to make one or more B Advances to the
Borrower as part of such proposed B Borrowing at a rate or
rates of interest specified by such Bank in its sole
discretion, by notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt
notice thereof to the Borrower), before 9:00 A.M. (Dallas
time) three Business Days before the date of such proposed B
Borrowing specified in the Notice of B Borrowing delivered
with respect thereto pursuant to paragraph (i) above, of the
minimum amount and maximum amount of each B Advance which such
Bank would be willing to make as part of such proposed B
Borrowing (which amounts may, subject to the proviso to the
first sentence of this Section 2.08(a), exceed such Bank's
Commitment), the rate or rates of interest therefor and such
Bank's Applicable Lending Office with respect to such B
Advance; provided that if the Agent in its capacity as a Bank
shall, in its sole discretion, elect to make any such offer,
it shall notify the Borrower of such offer before 8:45 A.M.
(Dallas time) three Business Days before the date of the
proposed B Borrowing specified in the Notice of B Borrowing
delivered with respect thereto pursuant to paragraph (i)
above.  Any Bank which has not notified the Agent of an offer
prior to the time specified above shall be deemed to have
elected not to make such an offer.

(iii)     The Borrower shall, in turn, before 10:00 A.M. (Dallas time)
three Business Days before the date of such proposed B
Borrowing specified in the Notice of B Borrowing delivered
with respect thereto pursuant to paragraph (i) above, either

(A)     cancel such B Borrowing by giving the Agent
notice to that effect, or





<PAGE>   21
(B)     accept one or more of the offers made by any
Bank or Banks pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its sole
discretion, by giving notice to the Agent of the amount of
each B Advance (which amount shall be equal to or greater than
the minimum amount, and equal to or less than the maximum
amount, notified to the Borrower by the Agent on behalf of
such Bank for such B Advance pursuant to paragraph (ii) above)
to be made by each Bank as part of such B Borrowing, and
reject any remaining offers made by Banks pursuant to
paragraph (ii) above by giving the Agent notice to that
effect.

(iv)     If the Borrower notifies the Agent that such B Borrowing is
cancelled pursuant to paragraph (iii)(A) above, the Agent
shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks and such B
Borrowing shall not be made.

(v)     If the Borrower accepts one or more of the offers made by any
Bank or Banks pursuant to paragraph (iii)(B) above, the Agent
shall in turn promptly notify (A) each Bank that has made an
offer as described in paragraph (ii) above, of the date and
aggregate amount of such B Borrowing and whether or not any
offer or offers made by such Bank pursuant to paragraph (ii)
above have been accepted by the Borrower, (B) each Bank that
is to make a B Advance as part of such B Borrowing, of the
amount of each B Advance to be made by such Bank as part of
such B Borrowing, and (C) each Bank that is to make a B
Advance as part of such B Borrowing, upon receipt, that the
Agent has received forms of documents appearing to fulfill the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III.  Each Bank
that is to make a B Advance as part of such B Borrowing shall,
before 1:00 P.M. (Dallas time) on the date of such B Borrowing
specified in the notice received from the Agent pursuant to
clause (A) of the preceding sentence or any later time when
such Bank shall have received notice from the Agent pursuant
to clause (C) of the preceding sentence, make available for
the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at
its address referred to in Section 10.02 such Bank's portion
of such B Borrowing, in same day funds.  Upon fulfillment of
the applicable conditions set forth in Article III and after
receipt by the Agent of such funds, the Agent will make such
funds available to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid
address.  Promptly after each B Borrowing the Agent will
notify each Bank of the amount of the B Borrowing, the
consequent B Reduction and the dates upon which such B
Reduction commenced and will terminate.

(b)     Each B Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of not less
than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and,
following the making of each B Borrowing, the Borrower shall be in compliance
with the limitation set forth in the proviso to the first sentence of Section
2.08(a).

(c)     Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this
Section 2.08, the Borrower may from time to time borrow under this Section
2.08, repay pursuant to subsection (d) below, and reborrow under this Section
2.08, provided that no B Borrowing shall be made within three Business Days of
the date of another B Borrowing.

(d)     The Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the account of each
Bank which has made a B Advance to the Borrower on the maturity date of each B
Advance (such maturity date being that specified by the Borrower for repayment
of such B Advance in the related Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to





<PAGE>   22
subsection (a)(i) above) the then unpaid principal amount of such B Advance.
The Borrower shall not have any right to prepay any principal amount of any B
Advance unless, and then only on the terms, specified by the Borrower for such
B Advance in the related Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection
(a)(i) above and set forth in the B Note evidencing such B Advance.

(e)     The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount
of each B Advance from the date of such B Advance to the date the principal
amount of such B Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such B
Advance specified by the Bank making such B Advance in its notice with respect
thereto delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) above, payable on the interest
payment date or dates specified by the Borrower for such B Advance in the
related Notice of B Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above, as
provided in the B Note evidencing such B Advance.

(f)     The indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from each B Advance
made to the Borrower as part of a B Borrowing shall be evidenced by a separate
B Note of the Borrower payable to the order of the Bank making such B Advance.

Section 2.09.  Payments, Computations; Interest on Overdue Amounts.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes to be
made by it not later than 10:00 A.M. (Dallas time) on the day when due in U.S.
dollars to the Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.02 in same day
funds.  The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds
relating to the payment of principal, interest or fees ratably (other than
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.06(c), 2.08, 2.10, 2.11 or 2.13) to the
Banks for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like
funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank to such
Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be
applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In no event shall any
Bank be entitled to share any administrative fee paid to the Agent pursuant to
Section 2.03(b), any bid request fee paid to the Agent pursuant to Section
2.03(c) or any other fee paid to the Agent, as such.

(b)     All computations of interest based on the Base Rate and of
fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate
or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent, and all computations of
interest pursuant to Section 2.06(c) shall be made by a Bank, on the basis of a
year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the
first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
interest or fees are payable.  Each determination by the Agent (or, in the case
of Section 2.06(c), by a Bank) of an interest rate hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(c)     Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fee, as the case
may be; provided, however, if such extension would cause payment of interest on
or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following
calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(d)     Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due by the Borrower to any Bank
hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may
assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such
date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Bank





<PAGE>   23
on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to
the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays
such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

(e)     Whenever any reference is made to any Bank's "ratable share"
or "ratable portion" (or any similar reference) of any amount hereunder, such
share or portion shall be calculated to not more than four decimal places,
rounding up or down, as appropriate.

(f)     Any amount payable hereunder or under the Notes or under any
other Credit Document which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity,
by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by
law, from the date on which such amount became due until such amount is paid in
full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to:  (i) in the
case of any overdue principal of any Advance, the greater of (x) the sum of the
Base Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum and (y) the sum of the
rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the
date on which such amount became due plus 2% per annum, or (ii) in the case of
any interest, fee or other amount payable hereunder or under the Notes or under
any other Credit Document, the sum of the Base Rate in effect from time to time
plus 2% per annum.

Section 2.10.  Consequential Losses.  If (a) any payment (or purchase
pursuant to Section 2.11(c)) of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Advance or B
Advance made to the Borrower is made other than on the last day of an Interest
Period relating to such Advance (or in the case of a B Advance, other than on
the original scheduled maturity date thereof), as a result of a prepayment
pursuant to Section 2.05(b) or 2.12 or acceleration of the maturity of the
Notes pursuant to Section 2.15 or Section 8.01 or for any other reason or as a
result of any such purchase; or (b) the Borrower fails to make a principal or
interest payment with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance or B Advance on
the date such payment is due and payable, the Borrower shall, upon demand by
any Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the
account of such Bank any amounts required to compensate such Bank for any
additional losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result
of any such payment or purchase, including, without limitation, any loss
(including loss of reasonably anticipated profits, except in the case of such a
purchase pursuant to Section 2.11(c)), cost or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
Bank to fund or maintain such Advance.

Section 2.11.  Increased Costs.  (a) If, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change (including without limitation, but without
duplication, any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements
included, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Eurodollar Rate Reserve
Percentage) in or in the interpretation, application or applicability of any law
or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any
central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of
law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or
making, funding or maintaining any Fixed Rate Advance to the Borrower, then the
Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Bank (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost.  A
certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower
and the Agent by such Bank, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of such
increased cost.  Promptly after any





<PAGE>   24
Bank becomes aware of any such introduction, change or proposed compliance,
such Bank shall notify the Borrower thereof, provided that the failure to
provide such notice shall not affect such Bank's rights hereunder, except that
such Bank's right to recover such increased costs from the Borrower for any
period prior to such notice shall be limited to the period of (i) 180 days, if
such increased cost relates to any outstanding Advance, or (ii) 90 days, in
each other event, immediately prior to the date such notice is given to the
Borrower.

(b)     If any Bank determines that compliance with any law or
regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or
would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank and that the amount of such
capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Bank's commitment
to lend to the Borrower hereunder and other commitments of this type, then,
upon demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the
Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank, from
time to time as specified by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Bank or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to
the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital to be
allocable to the existence of such Bank's commitment to lend hereunder.  A
certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Agent by such
Bank shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(c)     In the event that any Bank makes a demand for payment under
Section 2.06(c) or this Section 2.11, the Borrower may within ninety days of
such demand, if no Default then exists, replace such Bank with another
commercial bank in accordance with all of the provisions of the last sentence
of Section 10.06(a) (including execution of an appropriate Assignment) provided
that (i) all obligations of such Bank to lend hereunder shall be terminated and
the A Note and any B Note payable to such Bank and all other obligations owed
to such Bank hereunder shall be purchased in full without recourse at par plus
accrued interest at or prior to such replacement, (ii) such replacement bank
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, (iii) such replacement bank
shall, from and after such replacement, be deemed for all purposes to be a
"Bank" hereunder with a Commitment in the amount of the respective Commitment
of the assigning Bank immediately prior to such replacement (plus, if such
replacement bank is already a Bank prior to such replacement, the respective
Commitment of such Bank prior to such replacement), as such amount may be
changed from time to time pursuant hereto, and shall have all of the rights,
duties and obligations hereunder of the Bank being replaced, and (iv) such
other actions shall be taken by the Borrower, such Bank and such replacement
bank as may be appropriate to effect the replacement of such Bank with such
replacement bank on terms such that such replacement bank has all of the
rights, duties and obligations hereunder as such Bank (including, without
limitation, execution and delivery of new Notes to such replacement bank,
redelivery to the Borrower in due course of the Notes payable to such Bank and
specification of the information contemplated by Schedule I as to such
replacement bank).

Section 2.12.  Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if any Bank shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it
unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority shall assert that
it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to make any Fixed
Rate Advance or to continue to fund or maintain any Fixed Rate Advance
hereunder, then, on notice thereof to the Borrower by the Agent, (i) the
obligation of each of the Banks to make any Fixed Rate Advance of the same Type
shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks that
the circumstances





<PAGE>   25
causing such suspension no longer exist, and (ii) the Borrower shall forthwith
prepay in full all Fixed Rate Advances then outstanding of all Banks which are
affected Fixed Rate Advances, together with all accrued interest thereon and
all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.10, unless each Bank shall determine
in good faith in its sole opinion that it is lawful to maintain the Fixed Rate
Advances made by such Bank to the end of the Interest Period then applicable
thereto.

Section 2.13.  Taxes.  (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower or the
Guarantor hereunder or under the Notes or any other Credit Document shall be
made, in accordance with Section 2.09, free and clear of and without deduction
for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges
or withholdings with respect thereto, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding in the case of each Bank and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income,
and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
such Bank or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political
subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income,
and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Bank's
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").  If the Borrower or the
Guarantor shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of
any sum payable by it hereunder or under any Note or other Credit Document to
any Bank or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.13) such Bank or the
Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or the Guarantor,
as the case may be, shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower or the
Guarantor, as the case may be, shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law.

(b)     In addition, the Borrower or the Guarantor, as the case may
be, agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other
excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any
payment made by the Borrower or the Guarantor hereunder or under any Note or
other Credit Document executed by it or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note or
other Credit Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c)     THE BORROWER AND THE GUARANTOR WILL INDEMNIFY EACH BANK, THE
CO-AGENTS AND THE AGENT FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF TAXES OR OTHER TAXES (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY TAXES OR OTHER TAXES IMPOSED BY ANY JURISDICTION ON
AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THIS SECTION 2.13) OWED AND PAID BY SUCH BANK, CO-AGENT
OR THE AGENT (AS THE CASE MAY BE) AND ANY LIABILITY (INCLUDING PENALTIES,
INTEREST AND EXPENSES) ARISING THEREFROM OR WITH RESPECT THERETO.  THIS
INDEMNIFICATION SHALL BE MADE WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE SUCH BANK, THE
CO-AGENT OR THE AGENT (AS THE CASE MAY BE) MAKES WRITTEN DEMAND THEREFOR.

(d)     Within 30 days after the date of the payment of Taxes by or at
the direction of the Borrower or the Guarantor, the Borrower will furnish to
the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 10.02, the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

(e)     Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the Borrower or the Guarantor hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
Borrower and the Guarantor contained in this Section 2.13 shall survive the





<PAGE>   26
payment in full of principal and interest hereunder and under the Notes and
other Credit Documents.

(f)     Each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to the
Borrower and the Agent on the date of this Agreement or upon the effectiveness
of any Assignment and Acceptance (i) two duly completed copies of United States
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224 or successor applicable form, as the
case may be, certifying in each case that such Bank is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement and the Notes payable to it, without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, (ii) if applicable, an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 or successor applicable form, as the
case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup withholding
tax, and (iii) any other governmental forms which are necessary or required
under an applicable tax treaty or otherwise by law to reduce or eliminate any
withholding tax, which have been reasonably requested by the Borrower.  Each
Bank which delivers to the Borrower and the Agent a Form 1001 or 4224 and Form
W-8 or W-9 pursuant to the next preceding sentence further undertakes to
deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two further copies of the said Form 1001
or 4224 and Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower and
the Agent, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be
requested by the Borrower and the Agent certifying in the case of a Form 1001
or 4224 that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement
without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes.
The Borrower shall withhold tax at the rate and in the manner required by the
laws of the United States with respect to payments made to a Bank failing to
timely provide the requisite Internal Revenue Service forms.

Section 2.14.  Payments Pro Rata.  Except as provided in Sections
2.03(b), 2.03(c), 2.03(d), 2.06(c), 2.10, 2.11, 2.13, or 2.15, each of the
Banks agrees that if it should receive any payment (whether by voluntary
payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff
or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any
right under this Agreement or the Notes or other Credit Documents, or
otherwise) in respect of any obligation of the Borrower or Guarantor hereunder
or under the Notes or other Credit Documents of a sum which with respect to the
related sum or sums received by other Banks is in a greater proportion than the
total amount of principal, interest, fees or any other obligation incurred
hereunder, as the case may be, then owed and due to such Bank bears to the
total amount of principal, interest, fees or any such other obligation then
owed and due to all of the Banks immediately prior to such receipt, then such
Bank receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse
from the other Banks an interest in the obligations of the Borrower to such
Banks in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all of
the Banks in the aggregate unpaid amount of principal, interest, fees or any
such other obligation, as the case may be, owed to all of the Banks, provided
that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from
such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each other Bank shall be rescinded and
each such other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price to
the extent of such other Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of
(i) the amount of the participation purchased from such other Bank as a result
of such excess payment to (ii) the total amount of such excess payment) of such
recovery together with an amount equal to such other Bank's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such other Bank's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of
any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect
of the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower agrees





<PAGE>   27
that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this
Section 2.14 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

Section 2.15.  Optional Termination by  Banks.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Petrofina S.A., a societe
anonyme (corporation) organized and existing under the laws of Belgium
("Petrofina"), shall at any time own, directly or indirectly, capital stock of
the Guarantor representing less than 50% of the voting power of all capital
stock of the Guarantor, then in such event (i) the Guarantor shall promptly and
in any case within 15 days of such event notify the Agent and the Agent shall
so inform the Banks, (ii) each Bank shall have the option, for 30 days from the
date of its receipt of notice from the Agent, to terminate its Commitment and

ARTICLE IV

GUARANTY

Section 4.01.  Guaranty.  The Guarantor hereby unconditionally
guarantees the punctual payment of the Guaranteed Obligations when due, whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, and agrees to pay any and all
expenses (including counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Agent or any Bank
in enforcing any rights hereunder.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts which
constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Borrower
under this Agreement or any of the Notes but for the fact that they are
unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Borrower.

Section 4.02.  Guaranty Absolute.  The Guarantor guarantees that the
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
the Credit Documents executed from time to time by the Borrower, regardless of
any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction
affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or any Bank with respect
thereto.  The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are independent of the
Guaranteed Obligations, and provided an Event of Default exists as to the
Borrower and is continuing at the time an action is brought, a separate action
or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this
Agreement, irrespective or whether any action is brought against the Borrower
or whether the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.  The liability
of the Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:

(i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the
Credit Documents against the Borrower;

(ii)      any change in the time, manner or place of payment
of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations
or any other liabilities, or any other amendment or waiver of or any
consent to departure from any of the Credit Documents, including,
without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations or any
other liabilities resulting from the making of additional Advances
guaranteed by the Guarantor to the Borrower or otherwise;

(iii)      any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of
any collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or
consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any other liabilities;

(iv)      any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds
thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
liabilities, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any
collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
liabilities or any other assets of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries;





<PAGE>   31
(v)      any change, restructuring or termination of the
corporate structure or existence of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries; or

(vi)      any other circumstances which might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or
a guarantor.

This guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent or any Bank upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

Section 4.03.  Waiver.  The Guarantor hereby waives promptness,
diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the
Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Agent or
any Bank protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or
any property subject thereto or exhaust any right to take any action against
the Borrower or any other Person or any collateral.

Section 4.04.  Subrogation.  The Guarantor irrevocably waives any and
all rights to which it may be entitled, by operation of law or otherwise, upon
making any payment hereunder (i) to be subrogated to the rights of the Agent
and the Banks against the Borrower or any other Person with respect to such
payment or otherwise to be reimbursed, indemnified or exonerated by the
Borrower or any other Person in respect thereof or (ii) to receive any payment,
in the nature of contribution or for any other reason, from any Person who has
provided security for the Guaranteed Obligations or who has also guaranteed or
is otherwise liable for the Guaranteed Obligations with respect to which such
payment was made.  If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account of
such subrogation or contribution rights at any time, such amount shall be held
in trust for the benefit of the Banks and shall forthwith be paid to the Agent
to be credited and applied upon the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, in such order as may be determined by the Agent.

Section 4.05.  No Waiver; Remedies.  No failure on the part of the
Agent or any Bank to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right.  The remedies herein provided are cumulative and
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

Section 4.06.  Continuing Guaranty.  This guaranty is a continuing
guaranty and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the later of (A)
the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable
under this guaranty and (B) the expiration or termination of each Commitment of
each Bank to the Borrower, (ii) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors
and assigns, (iii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Agent,
the Co- Agents, and each of the Banks and their respective successors,
transferees and assigns, and (iv) not be terminated by the Guarantor or the
Borrower.

expressly indicated, include NationsBank in its individual capacity.
NationsBank and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as
trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with,
the Borrower, the Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Borrower or the Guarantor

has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Co-Agents or any
other Bank and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 5.05

own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Bank also

CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION,
MODIFICATION, AMENDMENT OR ENFORCEMENT (WHETHER THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS, LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE) OF, OR LEGAL ADVICE IN RESPECT OF RIGHTS OR
RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER, THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AGENT IS
NOT REIMBURSED FOR SUCH EXPENSES BY THE BORROWER OR THE GUARANTOR.

the Borrower and may be removed at any time by the Borrower if at any time the

$30,000,000 of the aggregate Commitments.  Upon any such resignation or
removal, the Borrower shall have the right to appoint, with the consent of the
Majority Banks (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), a successor
Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Borrower with
such consent of the Majority Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment,

other telex number designated by such party in a written notice to the other
parties hereto), confirmed by telex answerback, or delivered to the cable
company, respectively, except that notices and communications to the Agent
pursuant to Article II or IX shall not be effective until received by the
Agent.

Section 10.03.  No Waiver; Remedies.  No failure on the part of any
Bank or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right under any
Credit Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The remedies provided in the
Credit Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by
law.

Section 10.04.  Costs, Expenses and Taxes.  (a) The Borrower agrees to
pay on demand (i) all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent in connection
with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and
amendment of any Credit Document, including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Agent with respect thereto
and with respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities
under any Credit Document, Agent's out-of-pocket expenses associated with the
negotiation and closing and (ii) all costs and expenses, if any (including,
without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses, which may include
inside counsel), of the Agent and each Bank in connection with the enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) against the
Borrower or the Guarantor of any Credit Document.

(b)     THE BORROWER AGREES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE AGENT, THE CO-AGENTS AND EACH BANK AND EACH
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS FROM AND AGAINST
ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, REASONABLE FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS OF COUNSEL) FOR WHICH ANY OF THEM
MAY BECOME LIABLE OR WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY OR ASSERTED AGAINST THE AGENT,
THE CO- AGENTS OR SUCH BANK OR ANY SUCH DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT
(OTHER THAN BY ANOTHER BANK OR ANY SUCCESSOR OR ASSIGN OF ANOTHER BANK), IN
EACH CASE IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR BY REASON OF ANY
INVESTIGATION, LITIGATION, OR PROCEEDING, WHETHER OR NOT THE AGENT, THE
CO-AGENTS OR SUCH BANK OR ANY SUCH DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT IS A
PARTY THERETO, ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CREDIT
DOCUMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION IN WHICH ANY





<PAGE>   46
PROCEEDS OF ALL OR ANY PART OF THE ADVANCES ARE APPLIED (OTHER THAN ANY SUCH
CLAIM, DAMAGE, LIABILITY OR EXPENSE TO THE EXTENT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF, OR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR REGULATION BY,
ANY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY).

Section 10.05.  Right of Set-off.  Upon (i) the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or
the granting of the consent specified by Section 8.01 to authorize the Agent to
declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.01,
each Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and
other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower or the Guarantor against any and all of the obligations
of the Borrower or the Guarantor now or hereafter existing under the Credit
Documents, irrespective of whether or not such Bank shall have made any demand
under this Agreement or such Notes and although such obligations may be
unmatured.  Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Guarantor
after such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.  The rights of each Bank under this Section are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) which such Bank may have.

Section 10.06.  Bank Assignments and Participations.

(a)     Assignments.  Any Bank may assign to one or more banks or
other entities all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment,
the Advances owing to it, and the Notes held by it); provided, however, that
(i) each such assignment of an Assigning Bank's Commitment shall be of a
constant, and not a varying, percentage of all of such Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Commitment, (ii) the amount
of the resulting Commitment and Advances of the assigning Bank (unless it is
assigning all its Commitment) and the assignee Bank pursuant to each such
assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment with respect to such
assignment) shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 and shall be an integral
multiple of $1,000,000, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible
Assignee, (iv) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment,
together with the Note or Notes subject to such assignment, and (v) each
Eligible Assignee not already a Bank hereunder shall pay to the Agent an
assignment fee of $2,500 in connection with such assignment.  Upon such
execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment, which effective date shall be at least three
Business Days after the execution thereof, (A) the assignee thereunder shall be
a party hereto for all purposes and, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment, have the rights
and obligations of a Bank hereunder and (B) such Bank thereunder shall, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant
to such Assignment, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment covering all or the
remaining portion of such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

(b)     Terms of Assignments.  By executing and delivering an
Assignment, the Bank thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and
agree with each other and the other parties hereto the matters set forth in
paragraphs 2 and 3 of such Assignment.

(c)     The Register.  The Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to on Schedule I a copy of each Assignment delivered to and accepted
by it and a





<PAGE>   47
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the
Commitments of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Bank from
time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the
Guarantor, the Agent, and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the
Guarantor, or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

(d)     Procedures.  Upon its receipt of an Assignment executed by a
Bank and an Eligible Assignee, together with the Note or Notes subject to such
assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment has been completed and is in
substantially the form of the attached Exhibit C, (i) accept such Assignment,
(ii) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (iii) give
prompt notice thereof to the Borrower and the Guarantor.  Within five Business
Days after its receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall
execute and deliver to the Agent (x) in exchange for the surrendered A Note, a
new A Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the
Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment (without giving affect to
any B Reduction) and, if such assigning Bank has retained any Commitment
hereunder, a new A Note to the order of such Bank in an amount equal to the
Commitment retained by it hereunder (without giving affect to any B Reduction),
and (y) in exchange for any surrendered B Note, a new B Note to the order of
such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the B Advances assumed by it
pursuant to such Assignment and, if such assigning Bank has retained any B
Advances hereunder, a new B Note to the order of such Bank in any amount equal
to the B Advances retained by it hereunder.  Such new A Notes and B Notes shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and shall otherwise be in
substantially the form of the attached Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2, as the case
may be.

(e)     Participations.  Each Bank may sell participations to one or
more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it, and the Notes held by it);
provided, however, that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement
(including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall
remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Bank shall
remain the holder of any such Notes for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv)
the Borrower, the Guarantor, the Agent, and the other Banks shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, (v) such Bank shall not require the
participant's consent to any matter under this Agreement, except for changes in
the principal amount of such Bank's Commitment, any Note payable to such Bank
in which the participant has an interest, or the aggregate Commitments,
reductions in fees or interest, the date any amount is due hereunder, or
extending the Termination Date or continuing the Commitment of such Bank
pursuant to Section 2.15 hereof, and (vi) such Bank shall give prompt notice to
the Borrower of each such participation sold by such Bank.  The Borrower hereby
agrees that participants shall have the same rights under Sections 2.06(d),
2.10, 2.11, and 10.04 hereof as the Bank to the extent of their respective
participations.

(f)  Assignment to Federal Reserve Bank.  Notwithstanding the
limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this Section, any Bank may at any
time assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement or any Notes
payable to such Bank to a Federal Reserve Bank without the prior written
consent of the Borrower, the Guarantor, the Agent or the Co-Agents, provided
that no such assignment shall release such assigning Bank from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such Federal Reserve Bank for such Bank
as a party hereto.

Section 10.07.  Governing Law.  This Agreement, the Notes and the
other Credit Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Texas.

Section 10.08.  Interest.

(a)     It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Agent and
each Bank shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it, if any.
Accordingly, if the transactions with the Agent or any Bank contemplated hereby
would be usurious under applicable law, if any, then, in that event,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Notes, or any
other agreement entered into in connection with or as security for this
Agreement or the Notes, it is agreed as follows:  (i) the aggregate of all
consideration which constitutes interest under applicable law that is
contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by the Agent or such Bank,
as the case may be, under this Agreement, the Notes, or under any other
agreement entered into in connection with or as security for this Agreement or
the Notes shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount allowed by
such applicable law and any excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if
theretofore paid, shall at the option of the Agent or such Bank, as the case
may be, be credited by the Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, on the
principal amount of the obligations owed to the Agent or such Bank, as the case
may be, by the Borrower or refunded by the Agent or such Bank, as the case may
be, to the Borrower, and (ii) in the event that the maturity of any Note or
other obligation payable to the Agent or such Bank, as the case may be, is
accelerated or in the event of any required or permitted prepayment, then such
consideration that constitutes interest under law applicable to the Agent or
such Bank, as the case may be, may never include more than the maximum amount
allowed by such applicable law and excess interest, if any, to the Agent or
such Bank, as the case may be, provided for in this Agreement or otherwise
shall be cancelled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or
prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall, at the option of the Agent or such
Bank, as the case may be, be credited by the Agent or such Bank, as the case
may be, on the principal amount of the obligations owed to the Agent or such
Bank, as the case may be, by the Borrower or refunded by the Agent or such
Bank, as the case may be, to the Borrower.

(b)     In the event that at any time the interest rate applicable to
any Advance made by any Bank would exceed the maximum non-usurious rate allowed
by applicable law, the rate of interest to accrue on the Advances by such Bank
shall be limited to the maximum non-usurious rate allowed by applicable law,
but shall accrue, to the extent permitted by law, on the principal amount of
the Advances made by such Bank from time to time outstanding, if any, at the
maximum non-usurious rate allowed by applicable law until the total amount of
interest accrued on the Advances made by such Bank equals the amount of
interest which would have accrued if the interest rates applicable to the
Advances pursuant to Article II had at all times been in effect.  In the event
that upon the final payment of the Advances made by any Bank and termination of
the Commitment of such Bank, the total amount of interest paid to such Bank
hereunder and under the Notes is less than the total amount of interest which
would have accrued if the interest rates applicable to such Advances pursuant
to Article II had at all times been in effect, then the Borrower agrees to pay
to such Bank, to the extent permitted by law, an amount equal to the excess of
(a) the lesser of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on such
Advances if the maximum non-usurious rate allowed by applicable law had at all
times been in effect or (ii) the amount of interest rates applicable to such
Advances pursuant to Article II had at all times been in effect over (b) the
amount of interest otherwise accrued on such Advances in accordance with this
Agreement.

Section 10.09.  Execution in Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate





<PAGE>   49
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 10.10.  Survival of Agreements, Representations and
Warranties, Etc.  All warranties, representations and covenants made by the
Borrower or the Guarantor or any officer of the Borrower or the Guarantor
herein or in any certificate or other document delivered in connection with
this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Banks and
shall survive the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the making of the
Advances regardless of any investigation.  The indemnities and other
obligations of the Borrower contained in this Agreement, and the indemnities by
the Banks in favor of the Agent and its officers, directors, employees and
agents, will survive the repayment of the Advances and the termination of this
Agreement.

Section 10.11.  Borrower's Right to Apply Deposits.  In the event that
any Bank is placed in receivership or enters a similar proceeding, the Borrower
may, to the full extent permitted by law, make any payment due to such Bank
hereunder, to the extent of finally collected unrestricted deposits of the
Borrower in U.S. dollars held by such Bank, by giving notice to the Agent and
such Bank directing such Bank to apply such deposits to such indebtedness.  If
the amount of such deposits is insufficient to pay such indebtedness then due
and owing in full, the Borrower shall pay the balance of such insufficiency in
accordance with this Agreement.

Section 10.12.  Confidentiality.  Each Bank agrees that it will use
best efforts, to the extent not inconsistent with practical business
requirements, not to disclose without the prior consent of the Borrower and the
Guarantor (other than to employees, auditors, accountants, counsel or other
professional advisors of the Agent or any Bank) any information with respect to
the Borrower or the Guarantor or their Subsidiaries which is furnished pursuant
to this Agreement and which (i) the Borrower or the Guarantor in good faith
consider to be confidential and (ii) is either clearly marked confidential or
is designated by the Borrower or the Guarantor to the Agent or the Banks in
writing as confidential, provided that any Bank may disclose any such
information (a) as has become generally available to the public, (b) as may be
required or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to or
required by any municipal, state or Federal regulatory body having or claiming
to have jurisdiction over such Bank or submitted to or required by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or
elsewhere) or their successors, (c) as may be required or appropriate in
response to any summons or subpoena in connection with any litigation, (d) in
order to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such
Bank, (e) to the prospective assignee or participant in connection with any
contemplated transfer of any of the Notes or any interest therein by such Bank,
provided that such prospective assignee or participant executes an agreement
with or for the benefit of the Borrower and the Guarantor containing provisions
substantially identical to those contained in this Section 10.12.

Section 10.13.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Borrower, the Guarantor and the Agent,
and when each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof has delivered an
executed counterpart hereof to the Agent, has sent to the Agent a facsimile
copy of its signature hereon or has notified the Agent that such Bank has
executed this Agreement and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Borrower, the Guarantor, the Agent, each Bank and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower and the Guarantor
shall not have the right to assign any of their respective rights hereunder or
any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Banks.

SECTION 10.14.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  PURSUANT TO SECTION 26.02 OF THE
TEXAS BUSINESS AND COMMERCE CODE, A LOAN AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE AMOUNT INVOLVED
IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT EXCEEDS $50,000 IN VALUE IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNLESS THE
LOAN AGREEMENT IS IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE PARTY TO BE BOUND OR THAT
PARTY'S AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE.

THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES TO AN AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO
THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH SHALL BE DETERMINED SOLELY FROM THE WRITTEN LOAN
AGREEMENT, AND ANY PRIOR ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES ARE SUPERSEDED BY
AND MERGED INTO THE LOAN AGREEMENT.  THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND THE CREDIT
DOCUMENTS, AS DEFINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS,
OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.

Section 10.15.  Severability.  In the event that any one or more of
the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document
should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and
therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

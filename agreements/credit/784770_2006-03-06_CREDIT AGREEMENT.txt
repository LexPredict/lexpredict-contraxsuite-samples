Writing:
5B.01 OPTIONAL DEFAULTS — If any Event of Default referred to in subsection 5A.01 through 5A.07, both inclusive, shall occur
and be continuing, Bank shall have the right in its discretion, by giving written notice to Borrower,
(a) to terminate the Revolving
Commitment and Bank shall have no obligation thereafter to grant any Revolving Loan to Borrower, and
(b) to accelerate the maturity of all
of Borrower’s Debt to Bank (other than Debt, if any, already due and payable), and all such Debt shall thereupon become and thereafter be immediately due and payable in full without any presentment or demand and without any further or other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Borrower.
5B.02 AUTOMATIC DEFAULTS — If any Event of Default referred to in
subsection 5A.07 shall occur,
(a) the Revolving Commitment shall automatically and immediately terminate and Bank shall have no obligation
thereafter to grant any Revolving Loan to Borrower, and
(b) all of Borrower’s Debt to Bank (other than Debt, if any, already due and
payable) shall thereupon become and thereafter be immediately due and payable in full, all without any presentment, demand or notice of any kind, which are hereby waived by Borrower.
5B.03 OFFSETS — If there shall occur or exist any Default Under This Agreement referred to in subsection 5A.06, then, so long as that Default Under
This Agreement exists, Bank shall have the right at any time to set off against and to appropriate and apply toward the payment of the Subject Indebtedness then owing to it, whether or not the same shall then have matured, any and all deposit
balances then owing by Bank to or for the credit or account of Borrower, all without notice to or demand upon Borrower, all such notices and demands being hereby expressly waived.
6A. INDEMNITY: STAMP TAXES — Borrower will pay all stamp taxes and similar taxes, if any, including interest and penalties, if any, payable in respect of the issuance of the Subject Indebtedness.
6B. INDEMNITY: FUNDING COSTS — Borrower agrees to indemnify Bank against any loss relating in any way to its funding of a Cost of Funds Rate for any Subject Loan if
the Subject Loan is paid before the end of the applicable Contract Period (whether a prepayment or a payment following any acceleration of maturity) and to pay Bank, as liquidated damages for any such loss, an amount based on the principal amount
paid and computed for the period from the date of payment to the original due date of that installment, at a rate equal to the excess, if any, of the interest rate theretofore applicable over the Reinvestment Rate, all as determined by Bank in its
reasonable discretion. “Reinvestment Rate” means, when used with respect to any period, a per annum rate of interest equal to the “bond equivalent yield” for the most actively traded issues of U.S. Treasury Bills, U.S. Treasury
Notes, or U.S. Treasury Bonds for a term similar to the period in question.


20







6C. CREDIT REQUESTS — Whenever Borrower shall revoke any Credit Request for a Cost of Funds Loan, or shall for any
other reason fail to borrow pursuant thereto or otherwise comply therewith, or shall fail to honor any prepayment notice, then, in each case on Bank’s demand, Borrower shall pay Bank such amount as will compensate it for any loss, cost or
expense incurred by it by reason of its liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds.
6D. INDEMNITY: UNFRIENDLY TAKEOVERS — Borrower agrees
to indemnify Bank and hold Bank harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with any investigative,
administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not Bank shall be designated a party thereto) which may be incurred by Bank relating to or arising out of any actual or proposed use of proceeds of the Subject Loans in connection with the financing
of an acquisition of any corporation or other business entity, PROVIDED that Bank shall have no right to be indemnified hereunder for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
6E. INDEMNITY: CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS — If
(a) at any time any governmental authority shall require National City Corporation or Bank, whether or not the requirement has the force of law, to maintain, as support for the Revolving Commitment, capital in a
specified minimum amount that either is not required or is greater than that required at the date of this Agreement, whether the requirement is implemented pursuant to the “risk-based capital guidelines” (published at 12 CFR 3 in respect
of “national banking associations”, 12 CFR 208 in respect of “state member banks” and 12 CFR 225 in respect of “bank holding companies”) or otherwise, and
(b) as a result thereof the rate of return on capital of National City Corporation or Bank or both (taking into account their then policies as to capital
adequacy and assuming full utilization of their capital) shall be directly or indirectly reduced by reason of any new or added capital thereby allocable to the Revolving Commitment,
then and in each such case Borrower shall, on Bank’s demand, pay Bank as an additional fee such amounts as will in Bank’s reasonable opinion reimburse National City Corporation and Bank for any such reduced
rate of return.
6F. INDEMNITY: COLLECTION COSTS — If any Event of Default shall occur and shall be continuing, Borrower will pay Bank such further
amounts, to the extent permitted by law, as shall cover Bank’s costs and expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, interdepartmental charges and disbursements of its counsel) incurred in collecting the Subject Indebtedness
or in otherwise enforcing its rights and remedies in respect thereof.
6G. CERTIFICATE FOR INDEMNIFICATION — Each demand by Bank for payment pursuant
to section 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E or 6F shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth the reason for the payment, the amount to be paid, and the computations and assumptions in determining the amount, which certificate shall be presumed to be
correct in the absence of manifest error. In determining the amount of any such payment, Bank may use reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

7. BANK’S PURPOSE — Bank represents and warrants to Borrower that Bank is familiar with the Securities Act of
1933 as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder and is not entering into this Agreement with any intention of violating that Act or any rule or regulation thereunder, it being understood, however, that Bank shall at all times retain full
control of the disposition of its assets.
8. INTERPRETATION — This Agreement and the Related Writings shall be governed by the following provisions:

8.01 WAIVERS — Bank may from time to time in its discretion grant Borrower waivers and consents in respect of this Agreement or any
Related Writing or assent to amendments thereof, but no such waiver or consent shall be binding upon Bank unless specifically granted by Bank in writing, which writing shall be strictly construed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Borrower agrees that no course of dealing in respect of, nor any omission or delay in the exercise of, any right, power or privilege by Bank shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further or
other exercise thereof or of any other, as each such right, power or privilege may be exercised either independently or concurrently with others and as often and in such order as Bank may deem expedient.
8.02 CUMULATIVE PROVISIONS — Each right, power or privilege specified or referred to in this Agreement or any Related Writing is in addition to and

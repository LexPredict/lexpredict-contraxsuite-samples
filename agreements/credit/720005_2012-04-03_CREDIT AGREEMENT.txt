by Borrowers dated as of the Closing Date payable to the order of Lender in the amount of the Loan (the “Promissory Note”). The proceeds of the Loan may be disbursed in multiple advances (each, an “Advance”) through

and amounts of the obligations of Borrowers in respect of the Loan and interest and other amounts due or accrued hereunder; provided that the failure of Lender to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
obligation of Borrowers to pay any amounts due hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

2.5    Prepayment of Loan.
(a) Optional Prepayments. Borrowers shall have the right, without penalty or premium but subject to Section 2.8, at any time and from time to time, to prepay the Loan in whole or in
part, subject to the requirements of this Section. Borrowers shall notify Lender by telephone (confirmed by hand delivery or facsimile) of any such optional prepayment not later than 11:00 a.m., Tampa, Florida time, 3 Business Days before the date
of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date.

principal balance of the Loan as of a Collateral Valuation Date equals more than seventy


18










percent (70%) of the Collateral Value (or of the Provisional Collateral Value, in the case of Advances made prior to the Compliance Date), Borrowers, within 3 Business Days after their
delivery of such calculation, either (i) shall prepay sufficient principal on the Loan, or (ii) shall pledge additional Collateral acceptable to Lender, in its sole discretion, such that the outstanding principal balance of the Loan
(calculated as of the Collateral Valuation Date on a pro forma basis that includes the remedial action as though then taken) is equal to no more than seventy percent (70%) of the Collateral Value (or Provisional Collateral Value, if
applicable).
(c) Reduction/Prepayment Events. In the event and on each occasion that, after the making of the Loan,
any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of any Borrower in respect of any Reduction/Prepayment Event, (i) on the day of such receipt such Borrower shall provide to Lender written notice thereof, setting forth the nature of such
Reduction/Prepayment Event and the amount of such Net Proceeds (together with a reasonably detailed calculation thereof) and (ii) on the day of such receipt such Borrower shall, without penalty or premium, prepay the Loan in an amount equal to
such Net Proceeds.
(d) Procedure for Prepayments. Each notice delivered pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section
shall specify the principal amount of the Loan to be prepaid. Each partial prepayment of the Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount
of a mandatory prepayment or reduction payment. Optional prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest thereon.

2.6    Interest.
(a) Rate of Interest. The Loan shall bear interest at the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect plus two hundred seventy-five basis points (2.75%). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
principal of or interest on the Loan or any fee or other amount payable by Borrowers hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to 2.00% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to the Loan as provided in this Section.
(b) Payment of Interest. Accrued interest on the Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date; provided that in the event of any repayment or prepayment of the Loan, accrued
interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment.
(c)
Calculation of Interest. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable
Prime Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by Lender, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)
Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period:


(i)	Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for
such Interest Period; or



19










(ii)	Lender determines that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lender of making or maintaining the Loan for such
Interest Period;

then Lender shall give notice (which may be telephonic) thereof to a Borrower as promptly as practicable
thereafter and, until Lender determines that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, the Loan shall bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 100 basis points (1.00%).

2.7    Increased Costs.
(a) Reserves and Other Charges. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, Lender; (ii) impose on Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or the Loan;
or (iii) subject Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) and (c) of the definition of the term “Excluded Taxes” and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans,
loan principal, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to Lender of continuing or maintaining the Loan, or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, from time to time upon request of Lender, Borrowers will pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate Lender for such additional costs or expenses incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) Capital Requirements. If
Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting Lender or any lending office of Lender or Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has had or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
Lender’s capital or on the capital of Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, or the Loan, to a level below that which Lender or Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration Lender’s policies and the policies of Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then, from time to time upon request of Lender, Borrowers will pay to Lender such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate Lender or Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)
Certification. A certificate of Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section delivered to Borrowers shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrowers shall pay Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.


20









(d) Delay Not Waiver. Failure or delay on the part of Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of Lender to demand such compensation; provided that Borrowers shall not be required to compensate Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or expenses incurred or reductions
suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that Lender notifies Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions and of Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

2.8    Break Funding Payments. Except for any payments made pursuant to Sections 2.5(b) and
(c) of this Agreement, in the event of the payment of any principal of the Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), Borrowers shall compensate Lender for any
loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal
amount of the Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBO Rate-based interest rate that would have been applicable to such amount of the Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor,
over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate Lender would bid if it were to bid, at the commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from
other banks in the London interbank market. A certificate of Lender delivered to Borrowers and setting forth any amount or amounts that Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrowers shall
pay Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

2.9    Taxes.
(a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrowers under this Agreement shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as
required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable
withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then
the sum payable by Borrowers shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) Lender receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.


21









(b) Payment of Other Taxes by Borrowers. Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of Lender timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Lender.

(d) Indemnification by Borrowers. Borrowers shall indemnify Lender, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of
any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to Lender and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrowers
by Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
2.10    Withholding.

(a) Backup Withholding. Lender shall deliver to Borrowers, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrowers, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrowers as will permit payments made under this Agreement to be made without withholding Tax or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, Lender, if reasonably requested by
Borrowers, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by Borrowers as will enable Borrowers to determine whether or not Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation shall not be required if in Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would
subject Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of Lender.
(b) W-9. Without limiting the foregoing, Lender shall deliver to Borrowers from time to time upon the reasonable request of Borrowers, executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that Lender is
exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax.
(c) FATCA. If a payment made to Lender under this Agreement would be
subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), Lender shall
deliver to Borrowers at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably


22










requested by Borrowers such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably
requested by Borrowers as may be necessary for Borrowers to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that Lender has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
Solely for purposes of this subsection (c), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(d) Updates. Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly
notify Borrowers in writing of its legal inability to do so.
2.11    Treatment of Certain Refunds.
If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including
Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such
indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place the
indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to
require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

2.12    Payments Generally. Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by them hereunder prior to
the time expressly required hereunder for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, Tampa, Florida time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without any defense, setoff, recoupment or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of Lender, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. If any payment hereunder shall be due
on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in Dollars.

ARTICLE 3
RELATIONSHIP OF BORROWERS
Borrowers jointly and severally represent and
warrant to Lender, and agree with Lender, as set forth below in this Article.
3.1    Joint and Several
Liability. Borrowers are interdependent for their operational and financial needs, and they and Lender intend that each Borrower be jointly and severally liable for each monetary obligation, warranty and covenant obligation arising under this
Agreement. This Agreement is fair to all Borrowers, and the delivery of funds to any Borrower under this Agreement shall constitute valuable and fair consideration and reasonably equivalent value to all Borrowers for the purpose of binding them and
their assets on a joint and several basis for the Obligations. Lender may enforce this Agreement against any Borrower without first making demand upon or instituting collection proceedings against any other Borrower.

3.2    Administration. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates and appoints RJI as such Borrower’s
agent hereunder to act on behalf of all Borrowers for the purposes of giving and receiving notices and consents and otherwise acting in the administration of this Agreement. Any dealing of RJI with Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be deemed for the benefit of, and on behalf of, all Borrowers.
3.3    Unconditional
Obligation. The unconditional liability of each Borrower for the entire amount of the Obligations shall not be impaired by any event whatsoever other than indefeasible payment in full, including the merger, consolidation, dissolution, cessation
of business, or liquidation of any Borrower; the financial decline or bankruptcy of any Borrower; the failure of any other party to guarantee the Obligations or to provide collateral therefor; Lender’s compromise or settlement with or without
release of any Borrower, with or without reservation of rights; Lender’s release of any collateral for the Obligations, with or without notice to any Borrower; Lender’s forbearance in the exercise of any available remedies, including the
failure to file suit against any Borrower; Lender’s failure to give any Borrower notice of default; the unenforceability or reduction of the Obligations against any Borrower due to bankruptcy discharge, affirmative defense, counterclaim, or for
any reason other than indefeasible payment in full; Lender’s acceleration of or failure to accelerate the Obligations; the extension, modification, or renewal of the Obligations, with or without notice to any Borrower; Lender’s failure to
undertake or exercise diligence in collection efforts against any party or Collateral; the termination of any relationship of any Borrower with any other Borrower, including, without limitation, any relationship of commerce or ownership; any
Borrower’s change of name or use of any name other than the name used to identify such Borrower in this Agreement; or any Borrower’s use of the credit extended by Lender for any purpose whatsoever.

3.4    Subrogation Rights. Borrowers’ respective Subrogation Rights with respect to the Obligations are
not impaired by this Agreement, and liability for the


24










Obligations shall be allocated among Borrowers in the application of Subrogation Rights as to best uphold the validity of this Agreement and to give effect to Section 3.5; provided,
however, each Borrower agrees not to make any claim against or seek any payment directly or indirectly from another Borrower with respect to any Subrogation Right until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full.

3.5    Savings Provision. If, notwithstanding the contrary agreement and intention of the parties hereto, the
liability of any Borrower hereunder for the entire amount of the Obligations shall be subject to avoidance, reduction or limitation under any state or federal fraudulent conveyance law or other law that may be determined to be applicable, the
liability of such Borrower shall be limited to the maximum amount for which such Borrower may be liable without legal impairment.
3.6    Solvency. Giving effect to the Transactions and the anticipated use of proceeds of the Loan, (i) the fair value of the Property of each Borrower is greater than the
total amount of liabilities of such Person, (ii) each Borrower has capital that is not unreasonably small relative to its present and anticipated activities, and (iii) no Borrower has incurred, nor does any Borrower intend to incur,
liabilities beyond its ability to repay as they become due.
3.7    Suretyship Rights. Borrowers
waive any suretyship defenses that may be found applicable to their obligations hereunder, including, but not limited to, the defense of impairment of collateral and any defense based upon lack of notice of any event.

3.8    Independent Existence. The joint and several liability of Borrowers under this Agreement does not
impair their separate legal existence, and Borrowers warrant and represent that they do, and agree that they shall continue to, conduct their affairs as to maintain their separate legal existence.

ARTICLE 5
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
Borrowers jointly and severally represent
and warrant to Lender that, as of the Closing Date (unless otherwise specified):
5.1    Organization;
Powers. (a) Each Borrower is duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent the concept is applicable in such jurisdiction) in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) each Borrower has all power and
authority, all material Governmental Approvals and all material authorizations, consents, permits, licenses and registrations from and with any Self-Regulatory Organization or securities exchange required for the ownership and operation of its
properties and the conduct of its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted and (c) each Borrower is qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except, in the
case of sub-clauses (b) and (c), where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
5.2    Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are within each Borrower’s corporate or other organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or other organizational and, if required, stockholder or other equityholder action of each Borrower. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each
Borrower, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
5.3    Governmental Approvals; Absence of
Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with or any other action by any Governmental Authority, Self-Regulatory Organization or securities exchange to be obtained or made by any
Borrower or any Subsidiary, except such as have been obtained or made and are (or will so be) in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any law, including any order of any Governmental Authority, applicable to any Borrower or any
Subsidiary, except to the extent any such violations, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (c) will not violate the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of any
Borrower or any Subsidiary, (d) will not violate or result (alone or with notice or lapse of time, or both) in a default under any indenture or other agreement or instrument binding upon any Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their assets, or
give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment, repurchase or redemption to be made by any Borrower or any Subsidiary, or give rise to a right of, or result in, any termination, cancellation, acceleration or right of renegotiation of any
obligation thereunder, in each case except to


27










the extent that the foregoing, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and subject, to the extent necessary, to consents to be
obtained pursuant to Section 6.10, and (e) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of a Borrower or any Subsidiary, except pursuant to this Agreement.

5.4    Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. Except as disclosed in the financial statements
previously delivered to Lender or the notes thereto, as of the Closing Date, neither Borrowers nor any Subsidiary has any material contingent liabilities, unusual long term commitments or unrealized losses that, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2011, there has been no event or condition that has resulted, or could reasonably be expected to result, in a material adverse change in the business,
assets, liabilities, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrowers and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

5.5    Properties.
(a) Title to Property. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its property material to its business, except for minor defects in title that
do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes and Liens permitted by Section 7.3.

(b) Intellectual Property. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary owns, or is licensed to use, all patents, trademarks, copyrights,
licenses, technology, software, domain names and other intellectual property that is necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted and proposed to be conducted, without conflict with the rights of any other Person, except to the
extent any such conflict, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses, technology, software, domain names or other intellectual property used
by a Borrower or any Subsidiary in the operation of its business infringes upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. No claim or litigation regarding any patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses, technology, software, domain names or other intellectual property owned or used by a Borrower or any Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of a
Borrower or any Subsidiary, threatened against a Borrower or any Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Pledged Securities. The Pledged Securities all are duly issued and outstanding Equity Interests or debt obligations, as
applicable. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.5(c)(i), the applicable Borrower has good title to the Pledged Securities attributed to it in the Schedules hereto, free of any Lien except as permitted in this Agreement. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.5(c)(ii), all Equity Interests included in the Pledged Securities are non-assessable (including, but not limited to, funding


28










obligations to limited partnerships, all of which have expired). Borrowers are in compliance with their obligations under the Pledged Securities in all material respects, and to the knowledge of
Borrowers, no issuer or other party thereto is in breach of any obligations thereunder in any material respect. The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents (including, but not limited to, the grant of a security interest therein
and the exercise of remedies provided for in the Loan Documents) do not cause a breach, change voting rights, create a discount purchase right, or otherwise change any rights or duties under the terms of the applicable Constituent Documents to the
detriment of the holder of the Pledged Private Equity Securities. Schedules 1.1(a) and 1.1(b) include the initial collateral values assigned to the Pledged Auction Rate Securities and the Pledged Private Equity Securities for the
determination of the adequacy of the Collateral under Section 2.5(b). The values assigned thereto evidence the fair market value thereof as determined by Borrowers in their reasonable discretion in accordance with a customary definition
of fair market value and applying customary methodologies, including taking appropriate discounts for illiquidity and minority interests, and with appropriate reliance upon past valuations used for accounting purposes.

5.6    Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator, Governmental
Authority, Self-Regulatory Organization or securities exchange pending against or, to the knowledge of any Borrower, threatened against or affecting a Borrower or any Subsidiary that (i) could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

5.7    Environmental Matters. Except with respect to any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, no Borrower or Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability accruing to a Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their predecessors or
(iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability accruing to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their predecessors.
5.8    Compliance with Laws and Agreements.
(a)
General Compliance. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all laws, including all orders of Governmental Authorities, and all rules, regulations, orders, decrees or restrictions of any Self-Regulatory Organization or
securities exchange, applicable to it or its property (including the Exchange Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Commodity Exchange Act, Environmental Laws, ERISA
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the Board of Governors, FINRA, NYSE, MSRB, CFTC, FDIC and OCC) and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to comply,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material


29










Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing. Without limiting the foregoing, each Borrower and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all applicable capital requirements of all
Governmental Authorities (including Rule 15c3-1 and, as applicable, OCC and Board of Governors capital requirements).
(b)
Compliant Use of Proceeds. No part of the proceeds of the Loan will be used, directly or indirectly, or otherwise made available (A) for any payments to any officer or employee of a Governmental Authority, or any Person controlled by a
Governmental Authority, or any political party, official of a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in
violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or (B) to any Person for the purpose of financing the activities of any Person currently subject to any United States sanctions administered by OFAC.

5.9    Investment Company Status. No Borrower nor any Subsidiary is an “investment company” as
defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940.
5.10    Taxes.
Each Borrower and each Subsidiary has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except where (a) (i) the
validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (ii) a Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books reserves with respect thereto to the extent required by GAAP and
(iii) such contest effectively suspends collection of the contested obligation and the enforcement of any Lien securing such obligation or (b) the failure to do so could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.
5.11    ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all liabilities under each
Plan did not, individually or in the aggregate, exceed the fair market value of the assets of each Plan or of all underfunded Plans (as applicable) by an amount that, if required to be paid as of such date by a Borrower, any Subsidiary, or any ERISA
Affiliate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

5.12    Subsidiaries. Schedule 5.12 sets forth, as of the Closing Date, the name and jurisdiction of
organization of, and the percentage of each class of Equity Interests owned by a Borrower or any Subsidiary in, each Subsidiary, and identifies each Subsidiary. The Equity Interests in each Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid and non-assessable. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.12, as of the Closing Date, there is no existing option, warrant, call, right, commitment or other agreement to which a Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party requiring, and
there are no Equity Interests in any Subsidiary outstanding that upon exercise, conversion or


30










exchange would require, the issuance by any Subsidiary of any additional Equity Interests or other securities exercisable for, convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to
subscribe for or purchase any Equity Interests in any Subsidiary.
5.13    Insurance. Each Borrower
and each Subsidiary maintains, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance in such amounts (with no greater risk retention) and against such risks as are customarily maintained by companies of established repute engaged in
the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations.
5.14    Disclosure.
None of the reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of a Borrower or any Subsidiary to Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, included herein or furnished hereunder (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, taken as a whole, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not materially misleading; provided that, with respect to forecasts or projected financial information, each Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon accounting principles consistent in all
material respects with GAAP and Regulation S-X under the Securities Act (except as otherwise expressly disclosed in such forecasts and projections) and assumptions believed by it to be reasonable at the time made and at the time so furnished (it
being understood that forecasts and projections by their nature are inherently uncertain and no assurances are being given that the results reflected in such forecasts and projections will be achieved).

5.15    Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds of the Loan will be used, directly or indirectly,
for any purpose that entails a violation of any of Regulations T, U and X of the Board of Governors. Not more than 25% of the value of the assets of each Borrower and each Subsidiary subject to any restrictions on the sale, pledge or other
disposition of assets under this Agreement or any other agreement to which Lender or Affiliate of Lender is party will at any time be represented by margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors).

ARTICLE 6

AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS
Until the Obligations have been satisfied in full, Borrowers covenant and agree with Lender that:
6.1    Financial Information. Borrowers will furnish or cause to be furnished to Lender promptly after any request therefor, such information regarding the operations, business
affairs, assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and financial condition of a Borrower or any Subsidiary, or compliance with the terms of this Agreement, as Lender may reasonably request.

6.2    Notices of Material Events. Borrowers will furnish to Lender prompt written notice of the following:

(a) the occurrence of any Default;


31









(b) the filing or commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation by or before
any arbitrator or the SEC, the Board of Governors, FINRA, MSRB, NYSE, CFTC, FDIC, OCC, PBGC or any other Governmental Authority, Self-Regulatory Organization or securities exchange against or affecting a Borrower or any Subsidiary, or any adverse
development in any such pending action, suit, proceeding or investigation not previously disclosed in writing by a Borrower to Lender, that in each case could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or that in any manner
questions the validity of this Agreement;
(c) the occurrence of any ERISA Event or any fact or circumstance that gives rise
to a reasonable expectation that an ERISA Event will occur that, in either case, alone or together with any other ERISA Events that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in liability of a Borrower
and the Subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or more;
(d) the failure of any Borrower to timely perform in
response to a capital call or other funding demand made upon it by any fund or issuer with respect to any of the Pledged Private Equity Securities; and
(e) any other development that has resulted, or could reasonably be expected to result, in a Material Adverse Effect.
Each notice delivered under this Section shall be accompanied by a statement of a Financial Officer or other executive officer of a Borrower setting forth the details of the event or development requiring
such notice and any action taken or proposed to be taken with respect thereto.
6.3    Existence;
Conduct of Business. Each Borrower will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its legal existence and the rights, licenses, permits, privileges, franchises, patents, copyrights,
trademarks and trade names, and all authorizations, consents, permits, licenses and registrations from and with any Governmental Authority, Self-Regulatory Organization or securities exchange, necessary or material to the conduct of its business,
except where the failure to do so could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
6.4    Payment of Tax. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary will pay its Tax liabilities before the same shall become delinquent or in default, except where (a) (i) the
validity or amount thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (ii) a Borrower or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books reserves with respect thereto to the extent required by GAAP and (iii) such contest
effectively suspends collection of the contested obligation and the enforcement of any Lien securing such obligation or (b) the failure to make payment could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.


32









6.5    Maintenance of Properties. Each Borrower and each
Subsidiary will keep and maintain all property material to the conduct of its business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.
6.6    Insurance. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary will maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance in such amounts (with no greater risk
retention) and against such risks as are customarily maintained by companies of established repute engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations, except, in the case of wind and flood insurance coverage, if it
is not available on commercially reasonable terms and a Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect to its self-insurance in respect thereof in accordance with GAAP.

6.7    Books and Records; Inspection and Audit Rights. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary will keep proper
books of record and account in which full, true and correct entries in accordance with GAAP and applicable law are made of all dealings and transactions in relation to its business and activities. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary will permit
Lender, and any agent designated by Lender, upon reasonable prior notice, (a) to visit and inspect its properties, (b) to examine and make extracts from its books and records and (c) to discuss its operations, business affairs,
assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and financial condition with its officers and independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as reasonably requested.

6.8    Compliance with Laws. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary will comply with all laws (including the
Exchange Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Commodity Exchange Act, Environmental Laws, ERISA and all orders of any Governmental Authority) applicable to it or its
property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each Borrower and each Subsidiary will comply with all applicable capital requirements of all
Governmental Authorities (including Rule 15c3-1 and, as applicable, OCC and Board of Governors capital requirements).

6.9    Ownership of Subsidiaries. RJI will continue to own, directly or indirectly, free and clear of all
Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 7.3 that arise by operation of law), 100% of the outstanding Equity Interests in each of RJS, Forensics, Photos, and Properties, unless transferred in a Permitted Disposition.

6.10    Undertaking as to Consents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Security

Securities that provide Lender with consents. Borrowers shall deliver such control agreements and original instruments and certificated securities on or before the Compliance Date. Borrowers

6.11    Undertaking as to Operating Agreements. Prior to the Compliance Date, Borrowers shall cause Forensics,
Photos and Properties to amend their operating agreements or limited liability company agreements, as applicable, to expressly accommodate the rights of Lender under the Security Agreement. The terms of such amendments shall include the items
provided in Exhibit 6.11 attached hereto.
ARTICLE 7

NEGATIVE COVENANTS

assets (other than cash advances or loans) to, or any purchase, lease or other acquisition of any assets from, any Affiliate, in the ordinary course of business at prices and on terms and conditions not less favorable to a Borrower or such

and in every such event (other than an event with respect to a Borrower described in Section 8.1(h) or 8.1(i)), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, Lender may, by notice to Borrowers, declare the Loan
then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part), in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loan so declared to be due and
payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of Borrowers hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, in each case without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby waived by Borrowers; and in the case of any event with respect to a Borrower described in Section 8.1(h) or 8.1(i), the principal of the Loan then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other
obligations of Borrowers hereunder, shall immediately and automatically become due and payable, in each case without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by Borrowers. If an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, and whether or not Lender has accelerated the maturity of the Loan, Lender may proceed to protect and enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement, the Promissory Note and/or any of the other Loan Documents (including the
exercise of all remedies available to Lender under the Security Agreement) by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceeding, including to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the specific performance of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if any amount shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, the enforcement of the payment thereof. In the event
that, following the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, any monies are received in connection with the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or otherwise with respect to the realization upon any of the Collateral, such
monies shall be applied to the Obligations in such order of preference as Lender shall determine.

ARTICLE 9
GENERAL PROVISIONS
9.1    Interest Rate
Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to the Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively
the “Charges”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in
respect of the Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of the Loan but were not payable as
a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to Lender in respect of other periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest
thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by Lender.

9.2    Notices. Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by
telephone, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by fax, as follows:



(i)	if to a Borrower, to it at Raymond James Financial, Inc., 880 Carillon Parkway, St. Petersburg, FL 33716, Attention: Jeffrey P. Julien, Chief Financial Officer (Fax No.
(727) 567-5915); and



(ii)	if to Lender, to Regions Bank, 100 North Tampa Street, Suite 3100, Tampa, FL 33602, Attention: Debra Cross (Fax No. (813) 226-1260).


Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; and
notices sent by fax shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient).
Any party hereto may change its address or fax number for notices and other communications hereunder by written notice to the other parties hereto in the manner provided above.

9.3    Waivers; Amendments.
(a) No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure or delay by Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of Lender hereunder are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by a Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall



41










be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the making of the Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time (it
being the express intent of the parties hereto that Lender be able to exercise all rights and remedies provided for under the Loan Documents whether or not any Event of Default entitling the exercise of such rights and remedies was a condition
precedent to the making of the Loan on the funding date of the Loan).
(b) Amendments. Neither this Agreement nor any
provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Borrowers and Lender.
9.4    Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a)
Expenses. Borrowers shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Lender, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its
rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, post-closing requirements (including, but not limited to, those arising under Sections 6.10, 6.11 and 7.13) or in connection with the Loan made
hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loan.
(b) Indemnity. Borrowers shall indemnify Lender and each Related Party of Lender (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from,
any and all losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of (i) the structuring and negotiation of the credit facility provided for herein, (ii) the Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous
Materials on or from any property currently or formerly owned or operated by a Borrower or any Subsidiary, or any other Environmental Liability related in any way to a Borrower or any Subsidiary, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and whether initiated against or by any party to this Agreement, any Affiliate of any of the foregoing or any third party
(and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. This paragraph shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims
or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.


42









(c) Limitation of Claims. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a
Borrower shall not assert, or permit any of its Affiliates or Related Parties to assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained
through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Loan, or the use of the proceeds thereof. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Lender shall not assert, or
permit any of its Affiliates or Related Parties to assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against a Borrower, the Subsidiaries or their respective Related Parties, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, the Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that
the foregoing shall not relieve or limit in any manner a Borrower’s obligation to indemnify the Indemnitees pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section in respect of any such damages claimed by any third party against any Indemnitee.

(d) Due Upon Demand. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.

9.5    Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that a Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by a Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and Lender’s right of assignment is restricted as provided further in this Section 9.5. Until one year from the Closing Date, Lender shall not assign
the Loan in whole or in part without the prior written consent of Borrowers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and which consent shall be deemed granted as to any written request unless Borrowers object thereto in writing
within 5 Business Days of receipt thereof); provided, however, Borrowers’ consent shall not be required for such an assignment at any time that a Default or Event of Default exists. After such initial year, Lender may freely assign the Loan in
whole or in part without Borrowers’ consent. Any such assignee of Lender shall not be entitled to receive under Section 2.9 any payment greater than that which Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
assigned Loan (or any portion thereof). Without limitation, at all times, Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of Lender, including any pledge
or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release Lender from any
of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.


43









9.6    Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by Borrowers in this Agreement and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loan, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that Lender or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time this Agreement is executed and delivered or any credit is extended hereunder (including as a result of limited conditionality to making the Loan on the funding date of the
Loan), and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Sections 2.7, 2.8, 2.9
and 9.4 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loan, or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

9.7    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by
different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement constitutes the entire contract among the parties relating to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof, including the commitments of Lender and, if applicable, its Affiliates under any commitment letter
submitted by it (but does not supersede any other provisions of such commitment letter that do not by the terms of such documents terminate upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect).
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic imaging shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

9.8    Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

9.9    Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lender, and each
Affiliate thereof, is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency)
or other amounts at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by Lender, or by such an Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of a Borrower against any and all of the obligations then due of Borrowers now
or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by Lender, irrespective of whether or not Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations of


44










Borrowers are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of Lender, and each
Affiliate thereof, under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that Lender or Affiliate may have. Lender agrees to notify Borrowers promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that
the failure to give notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that Lender may otherwise have to bring any action
or proceeding relating to this Agreement against a Borrower or any of its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(c)
No Objection to Venue. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any such court.

to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Related Parties, including accountants, legal counsel and other agents and advisors, it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential, (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any
self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable law or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies under this Agreement or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing confidentiality undertakings
substantially similar to those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its Related Parties) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to a Borrower or any Subsidiary and its obligations, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating a Borrower or the
Subsidiaries or the credit facility provided for herein or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers with respect to the credit facility provided for herein;
(h) with the consent of a Borrower or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to Lender or any Affiliate of Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower. For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from a Borrower relating to a Borrower or any Subsidiary or their businesses, other than any such
information that is available to Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by a Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from a Borrower after the Effective Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of
delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

9.14    USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Lender hereby notifies Borrowers
that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, Lender is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of Borrowers and other information that will allow
Lender to identify Borrowers in accordance with such Act.
9.15    No Fiduciary Relationship. Each
Borrower, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, agrees that in connection with all aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, each Borrower, the Subsidiaries and their Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Lender and its Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of Lender or its Affiliates, and no such duty will be deemed to have arisen
in connection with any such transactions or communications. Lender and its Affiliates may be engaged, for their own accounts or the accounts of customers, in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of Borrowers,
the Subsidiaries and their Affiliates, and Lender has no obligation to disclose any of such interests to Borrowers, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Borrower hereby waives and releases any
claims that it, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates may have against Lender and its Affiliates with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers
or representatives as of the day and year first above written.

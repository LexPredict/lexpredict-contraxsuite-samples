Lender that is to make a Competitive Bid Advance as part of such Competitive Bid Borrowing has received notice pursuant to Section 2.07(e)(iii), such Lender shall, before 11:00 a.m. (New York City time), on the date of such Competitive Bid
Borrowing specified in the notice received from the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.07(e)(i), make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in
Section 9.02, in same day funds, such Lender’s portion of such Competitive Bid Borrowing. Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III and after receipt by the Administrative Agent of such funds, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to Kraft Foods Global at the location specified by Kraft Foods Global in its Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing. Promptly after each Competitive Bid Borrowing, the Administrative Agent will notify
each Lender of the amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing, the consequent Competitive Bid Reduction and the dates upon which such Competitive Bid Reduction commenced and will terminate.

(f) Irrevocable Notice. If Kraft Foods Global notifies the Administrative Agent that it accepts one or more of the offers made by
any Lender or Lenders pursuant to Section 2.07(c), such notice of acceptance shall be irrevocable and binding on Kraft Foods Global. Kraft Foods Global shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a
result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in the related Notice of Competitive Bid Borrowing for such Competitive Bid Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss
(excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Competitive Bid Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such
Competitive Bid Borrowing when such Competitive Bid Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.











(g) Amount of Competitive Bid Borrowings; Competitive Bid Notes. Each Competitive Bid
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $50,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and, following the making of each Competitive Bid Borrowing, the aggregate amount of Advances then outstanding shall not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders. Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in this Section 2.07, Kraft Foods Global may from time to time borrow under this Section 2.07, prepay pursuant to Section 2.11 or
repay pursuant to Section 2.07(h), and reborrow under this Section 2.07; provided that a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall not be made within two Business Days of the date of any other Competitive Bid Borrowing. The indebtedness of
Kraft Foods Global resulting from each Competitive Bid Advance made to Kraft Foods Global as part of a Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be evidenced by a separate Competitive Bid Note of Kraft Foods Global payable to the order of the Lender making
such Competitive Bid Advance.
(h) Repayment of Competitive Bid Advances. On the maturity date of each Competitive Bid
Advance provided in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance, Kraft Foods Global shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender that has made a Competitive Bid Advance the then unpaid principal amount
of such Competitive Bid Advance. Kraft Foods Global shall not have any right to prepay any principal amount of any Competitive Bid Advance unless, and then only on the terms set forth in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid
Advance.
(i) Interest on Competitive Bid Advances. Kraft Foods Global shall pay interest on the unpaid principal
amount of each Competitive Bid Advance from the date of such Competitive Bid Advance to the date the principal amount of such Competitive Bid Advance is repaid in full, at the rate of interest for such Competitive Bid Advance and on the interest
payment date or dates set forth in the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Kraft Foods Global shall pay interest on the amount of unpaid principal of
each Competitive Bid Advance owing to a Lender, payable in arrears on the date or dates interest is payable thereon, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 1% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Competitive Bid
Advance under the terms of the Competitive Bid Note evidencing such Competitive Bid Advance unless otherwise agreed in such Competitive Bid Note.
SECTION 2.08 LIBO Rate Determination.
(a) Methods to Determine LIBO
Rate. The Administrative Agent shall determine the LIBO Rate by using the methods described in the definition of the term “LIBO Rate,” and shall give prompt notice to Kraft Foods Global and Lenders of each such LIBO Rate.

(b) Role of Reference Banks. In the event that the LIBO Rate cannot be determined by the method described in clause (a) of
the definition of “LIBO Rate,” each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Administrative Agent timely information for the purpose of determining the LIBO Rate in accordance with the method described in clause (b) of the definition
thereof. If any one or more of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining a LIBO Rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely
information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks. If fewer than two Reference Banks furnish timely information to the Administrative Agent for determining the LIBO Rate for any LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances, as the case may
be, then:











(i) the Administrative Agent shall forthwith notify Kraft Foods Global and
the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such LIBO Rate Advance or Floating Rate Bid Advances, as the case may be;
(ii) with respect to each LIBO Rate Advance, such Advance will, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, be prepaid by Kraft Foods Global or be automatically Converted into a Base
Rate Advance; and
(iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances
or to Convert Base Rate Advances into LIBO Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify Kraft Foods Global and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to Kraft Foods Global and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative
Agent for purposes of Section 2.04(a)(i) or (ii) and the rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the interest rate under Section 2.04(a)(ii) or the applicable LIBO Rate.

(c) Inadequate LIBO Rate. If, with respect to any LIBO Rate Advances, the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that
(i) they are unable to obtain matching deposits in the London interbank market at or about 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second Business Day before the making of a Borrowing in sufficient amounts to fund their respective LIBO Rate Advances as
a part of such Borrowing during the Interest Period therefor or (ii) the LIBO Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective LIBO
Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify Kraft Foods Global and the Lenders, whereupon (A) Kraft Foods Global will, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, either
(x) prepay such Advances or (y) Convert such Advances into Base Rate Advances and (B) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Base Rate Advances into, LIBO Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent
shall notify Kraft Foods Global and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. In the case of clause (ii) above, each such Lender shall certify its cost of funds for each Interest Period to the Administrative
Agent and Kraft Foods Global as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 10 Business Days after the last day of such Interest Period.
SECTION 2.09 Fees.
(a) Unused Line Fee. Kraft Foods Global agrees
to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender an unused line fee (the “Unused Line Fee”) on the aggregate amount of such Lender’s undrawn Commitment (without giving effect to any Competitive Bid Reduction)
from the date hereof in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date at the Applicable Unused
Line Fee Rate, in each case payable on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December until the Termination Date and on the Termination Date.











(b) Other Fees. Kraft Foods Global shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own
account or for the accounts of the Joint Lead Arrangers or Lenders, as applicable, such fees, and at such times, as shall have been separately agreed between Kraft Foods Global and the Administrative Agent or the Joint Lead Arrangers.

SECTION 2.10 Optional and Mandatory Termination or Reduction of Commitments.

(a) Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments. Kraft Foods Global shall have the right, upon at least three Business
Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders; provided that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of no less
than $50,000,000 or the remaining balance if less than $50,000,000; and provided further that the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced to an amount that is less than the aggregate principal amount of
the Competitive Bid Advances then outstanding.
(b) Mandatory Termination or Reduction of Commitments. If
(i) Kraft Foods Global or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries receives Net Cash Proceeds from any Debt Issuance, (ii) prior to consummation of the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods Global issues debt securities in exchange for existing Debt of Kraft
Foods or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) Kraft Foods Global (or, prior to consummation of the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods) receives Net Cash Proceeds from any Equity Capital Markets Transaction or (iv) Kraft Foods Global or any of its Major
Domestic Subsidiaries receives Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale, Casualty or Condemnation, in each case that would be required to be applied to prepay Pro Rata Advances pursuant to Section 2.11(b) (the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds (or,
in the case of clause (ii), the amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such debt securities) required to be so applied being called the “Required Prepayment Amount”), Kraft Foods Global shall by notice to the
Administrative Agent reduce, on a pro rata basis, the unused Commitments of the Lenders by an aggregate amount equal to such Required Prepayment Amount.
SECTION 2.11 Optional and Mandatory Prepayments of Pro Rata Advances.
(a)
Optional Prepayments. Kraft Foods Global may, in the case of any LIBO Rate Advance, upon at least three Business Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent or, in the case of any Base Rate Advance, upon notice given to the Administrative
Agent not later than 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed prepayment, in each case stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given Kraft Foods Global shall, prepay the
outstanding principal amount of the Pro Rata Advances comprising part of the same Pro Rata Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided,
however, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of no less than $50,000,000 or the remaining balance if less than $50,000,000 and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a LIBO Rate Advance,
Kraft Foods Global shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.04(b).
(b)
Mandatory Prepayment Events. Within five Business Days after:











(i) the receipt by Kraft Foods Global or any of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Net Cash Proceeds from any Debt Issuance, Kraft Foods Global shall permanently prepay the Pro Rata Advances in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds; provided that, at the election of Kraft Foods Global,
no prepayment of the Pro Rata Advances shall be required pursuant to this clause (i) until the Unapplied Amount exceeds the Prepayment Threshold Amount and then only to the extent of such excess; or

(ii) the issuance, prior to consummation of the Spin-Off, by Kraft Foods Global or any of its Subsidiaries of debt
securities in exchange for existing Debt of Kraft Foods or any of its Subsidiaries, Kraft Foods Global shall permanently prepay the Pro Rata Advances in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such debt securities
issued by Kraft Foods Global or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that, at the election of Kraft Foods Global, no prepayment of the Pro Rata Advances shall be required pursuant to this clause (ii) until the Unapplied Amount exceeds the
Prepayment Threshold Amount and then only to the extent of such excess; or
(iii) the receipt by Kraft Foods
Global (or, prior to consummation of the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods) of Net Cash Proceeds from any Equity Capital Markets Transaction, Kraft Foods Global shall permanently prepay the Pro Rata Advances in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash
Proceeds; provided that, at the election of Kraft Foods Global, no prepayment of the Pro Rata Advances shall be required pursuant to this clause (iii) until the Unapplied Amount exceeds the Prepayment Threshold Amount and then only to
the extent of such excess; or
(iv) the receipt by Kraft Foods Global or any of its Major Domestic Subsidiaries
of Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale (other than (A) Net Cash Proceeds of any Exempted Asset Sale and (B) up to $1,000,000,000 in the aggregate of Net Cash Proceeds from other Asset Sales), Casualty or Condemnation, Kraft Foods Global
shall permanently prepay the Pro Rata Advances in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds, provided that, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in lieu of such prepayment, Kraft Foods Global or such
Major Domestic Subsidiary may reinvest all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds from any Asset Sale, Casualty or Condemnation in long-term assets useful to the business of Kraft Foods Global or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that such
reinvestment is consummated within 12 months of the date of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds,
and each prepayment of outstanding Pro Rata
Advances pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) shall be without penalty or premium (other than any obligation to reimburse the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.04(b)). Kraft Foods Global may determine to which Borrowing or Borrowings each
prepayment of outstanding Pro Rata Advances pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) shall be allocated, provided that any such allocated prepayment shall be applied on a pro rata basis among the Lenders having made any of such Pro Rata
Advances.
(c) Mandatory Prepayment if Advances Exceed Commitments. In the event and on each occasion that the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Advances exceeds the aggregate amount of the Commitments, Kraft Foods Global shall prepay Advances in an aggregate amount equal to such excess. Each prepayment of outstanding Advances pursuant to













this Section 2.11(c) shall be without penalty or premium (other than any obligation to reimburse the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.04(b)). Kraft Foods Global may determine to which
Borrowing or Borrowings each prepayment of outstanding Advances pursuant to this Section 2.11(c) shall be allocated, provided that any such prepayment allocated to Pro Rata Advances shall be applied on a pro rata basis among the Lenders
having made any of such Pro Rata Advances.
SECTION 2.12 Increased Costs.

(a) Costs from Change in Law or Authorities. If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change
by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements to the extent such change is included in the Eurocurrency Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation, application or administration of any law or regulation or (ii) the
compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining LIBO
Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.12 any such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.15 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of
taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then
Kraft Foods Global shall within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by Kraft Foods Global of demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and
regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to Kraft Foods Global and the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto for all purposes,
absent manifest error.
(b) Reduction in Lender’s Rate of Return. In the event that, after the date hereof, the
implementation of or any change in any law or regulation, or any guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) or the interpretation, application or administration thereof by any central bank or other authority charged with the
administration thereof, imposes, modifies or deems applicable any capital adequacy or similar requirement (including, without limitation, a request or requirement which affects the manner in which any Lender or its parent company allocates capital
resources to its Commitments, including its obligations hereunder) and as a result thereof, in the sole opinion of such Lender, the rate of return on such Lender’s or its parent company’s capital as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder is reduced to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such circumstances, but reduced to the extent that Borrowings are outstanding from time to time, then in each such case, upon demand from time to time Kraft
Foods Global shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as shall compensate such Lender for such reduction in rate of return. A certificate of such Lender as to any such additional amount or amounts shall be













conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Except as provided below, in determining any such amount or amounts each Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution
methods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Lender shall take all reasonable actions to avoid the imposition of, or reduce the amounts of, such increased costs, provided that such actions, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender will not
be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender and, to the extent possible, each Lender will calculate such increased costs based upon the capital requirements for its Advances and unused Commitment hereunder and not upon the average or general capital
requirements imposed upon such Lender.
(c) Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; Basel III.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules,
guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to
Basel III, shall, in each case be deemed to be a change in law or regulation regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
SECTION 2.13 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any change in, or in the
interpretation of, any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make LIBO Rate
Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances or to fund or maintain LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances, (a) each LIBO Rate Advance or Floating Rate Bid Advances, as the case may be, of such Lender will automatically, upon such demand,
be Converted into a Base Rate Advance or an Advance that bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.04(a)(i), as the case may be, and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances or to
Convert Base Rate Advances into LIBO Rate Advances shall be suspended, in each case, until the Administrative Agent shall notify Kraft Foods Global and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, in each case, subject
to Section 9.04(b) hereof; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different
Eurocurrency Lending Office if the making of such a designation would allow such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations to make LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances or to continue to fund or
maintain LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances, as the case may be, and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
SECTION 2.14 Payments and Computations.
(a) Time and Distribution of
Payments. Kraft Foods Global shall make each payment hereunder, without set-off or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the day when due to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent Account in same day
funds. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or Unused Line Fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.07, 2.12, 2.15 or
9.04(b)) to the Lenders for the accounts












of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office,
in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. From and after the effective date of an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to Section 9.07, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder in respect of the
interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

(b) Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest based on the Administrative Agent’s prime rate shall be
made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. All computations of interest based on the LIBO Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate and of Unused Line Fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent
and all computations of interest pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be made by a Lender, on the basis of a year of 360 days, and all computations of interest in respect of Competitive Bid Advances shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the
basis of a year of 360 days in the case of Floating Rate Bid Advances and on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, as specified in the applicable Notice of Competitive Bid Notice, in each case for the actual number of
days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or Unused Line Fees are payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of Section 2.05 by a Lender), of an
interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(c) Payment Due
Dates. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
payment of interest or Unused Line Fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of LIBO Rate Advances or Floating Rate Bid Advances to be made in the next following
calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.
(d) Presumption of Borrower
Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from Kraft Foods Global prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that Kraft Foods Global will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may
assume that Kraft Foods Global has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the
amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent Kraft Foods Global has not made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.











SECTION 2.15 Taxes.

(a) Any and all payments by Kraft Foods Global and Kraft Foods hereunder or under any Note shall be made, in accordance with
Section 2.14, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities (including penalties, interest, additions to taxes and expenses) with
respect thereto, excluding, (i) in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as
the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof, (ii) in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Lender’s Applicable Lending Office or any
political subdivision thereof, (iii) in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its net income, franchise taxes imposed on it, and any tax imposed by means of withholding to the extent such tax is imposed solely
as a result of a present or former connection (other than a connection arising from such Lender or the Administrative Agent having executed, delivered, enforced, become a party to, performed its obligations, received payments, received or perfected
a security interest under, and/or engaged in any other transaction pursuant to this Agreement or a Note) between the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and the taxing jurisdiction, (iv) in the case of each Lender and the
Administrative Agent, any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed pursuant to FATCA, and (v) in the case of each Lender and the Administrative Agent, any Home Jurisdiction U.S. Withholding Tax to the extent that such tax is imposed with respect
to any payments pursuant to any law in effect at the time such Lender becomes a party hereto (or changes its Applicable Lending Office), except (A) to the extent of the additional amounts in respect of such taxes under this Section 2.15 to
which such Lender’s assignor (if any) or such Lender’s prior Applicable Lending Office (if any) was entitled, immediately prior to such assignment or change in its Applicable Lending Office or (B) if such Lender becomes a party hereto
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance upon the demand of Kraft Foods Global (all such taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of payments by Kraft Foods Global and Kraft Foods hereunder or under any
Note, other than taxes referred to in this Section 2.15(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), are referred to herein as “Taxes”). If any applicable withholding agent shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (i) the sum payable by Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods shall be increased as may be necessary so that after all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) have been made, such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, Kraft Foods Global shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or
property taxes, charges, irrecoverable value-added tax or similar levies (other than Taxes, or taxes referred to in Section 2.15(a)(i) to (iv)) that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of,
performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or a Note other than any such taxes imposed by reason of an Assignment and Acceptance (hereinafter referred to as “Other Taxes”).

(c) Kraft Foods Global shall indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes
or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, Taxes and Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.15) payable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may













be), and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to taxes and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), makes written demand therefor.
(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes, Kraft Foods Global shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. If Kraft Foods Global determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, Kraft Foods Global shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent, furnish or cause the payor to furnish, the
Administrative Agent and each Lender an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes.
(e) Each Lender, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a
Lender in the case of each other Lender, shall provide each of the Administrative Agent and Kraft Foods Global with any form or certificate that is required by any United States federal taxing authority to certify such Lender’s entitlement to
any applicable exemption from or reduction in, Home Jurisdiction U.S. Withholding Tax in respect of any payments hereunder or under any Note (including, if applicable, two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9, W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as
appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service or to the extent a Non-U.S. Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership or participating Lender granting a typical
participation), two original Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by any applicable certification documents from each beneficial owner) and any other documentation reasonably requested by Kraft Foods Global or the Administrative Agent.
Thereafter, each such Lender shall provide additional forms or certificates (i) to the extent a form or certificate previously provided has become inaccurate or invalid or has otherwise ceased to be effective or (ii) as requested in
writing by Kraft Foods Global or the Administrative Agent or, if such Lender no longer qualifies for the applicable exemption from or reduction in, Home Jurisdiction U.S. Withholding Tax, promptly notify the Administrative Agent and Kraft Foods
Global of its inability to do so. Unless Kraft Foods Global and the Administrative Agent have received forms or other documents from each Lender satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder or under any Note are not subject to Home
Jurisdiction U.S. Withholding Taxes or are subject to Home Jurisdiction U.S. Withholding Taxes at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, Kraft Foods Global or the Administrative Agent shall withhold such taxes from such payments at the
applicable statutory rate in the case of payments to or for such Lender and Kraft Foods Global shall pay additional amounts to the extent required by paragraph (a) of this Section 2.15 (subject to the exceptions contained in this
Section 2.15).
(f) If a payment made to a Lender hereunder or under any Note would be subject to U.S. Federal
withholding tax imposed pursuant to FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, applicable), such Lender
shall provide each of the Administrative Agent and Kraft Foods Global, at the time or times prescribed by law and as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or Kraft Foods Global, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including
as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i)












of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or Kraft Foods Global as may be necessary for the Administrative Agent or Kraft
Foods Global to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA and the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Thereafter, each such
Lender shall provide additional documentation (i) to the extent documentation previously provided has become inaccurate or invalid or has otherwise ceased to be effective or (ii) as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or Kraft
Foods Global.
(g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 agrees to use
reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to select or change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a selection or change would avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender be otherwise materially economically disadvantageous to such Lender.

(h) No additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 with respect to any Tax to the extent such Tax would not
have been payable had the Lender fulfilled its obligations under paragraph (e) or (f) of this Section 2.15 as applicable.
(i) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, obtains a refund of any Tax for which payment has been made pursuant to this Section 2.15, or, in lieu of obtaining such refund,
such Lender or the Administrative Agent applies the amount that would otherwise have been refunded as a credit against payment of a liability in respect of Taxes, which refund or credit in the good faith judgment of such Lender or the Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, (and without any obligation to disclose its tax records) is allocable to such payment made under this Section 2.15, the amount of such refund or credit (together with any interest received thereon and reduced by
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining such refund or credit) promptly shall be paid to Kraft Foods Global to the extent payment has been made in full by Kraft Foods Global pursuant to this Section 2.15.

SECTION 2.16 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Pro Rata Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.12, 2.15 or 9.04(b) or (c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Pro Rata Advances
obtained by all the Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Pro Rata Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of
them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered
from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Kraft Foods Global agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to
this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Kraft Foods Global in
the amount of such participation.











SECTION 2.17 Evidence of Debt.

(a) Lender Records; Pro Rata Notes. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing the indebtedness of Kraft Foods Global to such Lender resulting from each Pro Rata Advance owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder
in respect of Pro Rata Advances. Kraft Foods Global shall, upon notice by any Lender to Kraft Foods Global (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect that a Pro Rata Note is required or appropriate in order for such
Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Pro Rata Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Pro Rata Note payable to the order of such Lender in a
principal amount up to the Commitment of such Lender.
(b) Record of Borrowings, Payables and Payments. The Register
maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded as follows:

(i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if
appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto;
(ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it;
(iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become
due and payable from Kraft Foods Global to each Lender hereunder and the Termination Date applicable thereto; and
(iv) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent from Kraft Foods Global hereunder and each Lender’s share thereof.

(c) Evidence of Payment Obligations. Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to
Section 2.17(b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.17(a), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Kraft Foods Global to, in
the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest error; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an
entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Kraft Foods Global under this Agreement.











SECTION 2.18 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and
Kraft Foods Global agrees that it shall use such proceeds) for general corporate purposes of Kraft Foods Global and its Subsidiaries and, prior to the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods and its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 2.19 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply:
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the Commitment of such
Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.09(a); and
(b) the Commitment and Advances of such Defaulting Lender shall not be
included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01); provided that any amendment,
waiver or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
In the event that each of the Administrative Agent and Kraft Foods Global agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then such
Lender shall purchase at par such of the Pro Rata Advances of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Pro Rata Advances in accordance with its pro rata portion of the total
Commitments and clauses (a) and (b) above shall cease to apply.

such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required
to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be
binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this
Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by Kraft Foods Global as required by the terms of this Agreement or at the request of Kraft Foods Global, and any notice
provided pursuant to Section 5.02(b)(iv). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall any Agent have or be
deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against any Agent. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” herein with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.











SECTION 7.02 Administrative Agent’s Reliance, Etc. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(a) may treat the Lender that
made any Advance as the holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in
Section 9.07;
(b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for Kraft Foods Global or Kraft
Foods), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts;

(c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for any statements,
warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with this Agreement by Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods;
(d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods
or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods;
(e) shall
not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and

(f) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or
other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier, telegram, telex, registered mail or, for the purposes of Section 2.02(a) or 2.07(b), email) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.03 The Administrative Agent and Affiliates. With respect to its Commitment and the Advances made by it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall,
unless otherwise expressly indicated, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, Kraft Foods Global, Kraft Foods, any of their respective Subsidiaries and any Person who may do business with or own securities of Kraft Foods Global, Kraft Foods or any such
Subsidiary, all as if the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.











SECTION 7.04 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon any Co-Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, any Joint Bookrunner or Joint Lead Arranger, or any other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to
in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
any Co-Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent, the Syndication Agent, the Documentation Agent, any Joint Bookrunner or Joint Lead Arranger, or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.
SECTION 7.05
Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods), ratably according to the respective principal amounts of the Pro Rata Advances then owing to each of
them (or if no Pro Rata Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement, in each case, to the extent relating to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (collectively, the “Indemnified Costs”), provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of the
Indemnified Costs resulting from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or
otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods. In the case of any investigation,
litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 7.05 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or a third party.

SECTION 7.06 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to
the Lenders and Kraft Foods Global and may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders. Upon the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor
Administrative Agent (with the consent of Kraft Foods Global so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted
such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s giving of notice of resignation or the Required Lenders’ removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may (with the consent
of Kraft Foods Global so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of
America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least












$500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement; provided that
should the Administrative Agent for any reason not appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which it is under no obligation to do, then the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties referred to in this Section 7.06 shall be vested in
the Required Lenders until a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as
to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.
SECTION 7.07
Co-Administrative Agents, Syndication Agent, Documentation Agent, Joint Bookrunners and Joint Lead Arrangers. (i) Barclays Bank PLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. have been designated as Co-Administrative Agents, (ii) Citibank, N.A.
has been designated as Syndication Agent, (iii) The Royal Bank of Scotland plc has been designated as Documentation Agent, (iv) Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBS Securities Inc. have been
designated as Joint Bookrunners under this Agreement and (v) Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBS Securities Inc. have been designated as Joint Lead Arrangers under this Agreement, but the use of
the aforementioned titles does not impose on any of them any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender.

SECTION 7.08 Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment
to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.15(a) or (c), each Lender shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable
in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for
any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or
reduction of withholding tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any Note against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 7.08. The agreements in this Section 7.08 shall survive the
resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Agreement and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.











ARTICLE VIII
Guaranty
SECTION 8.01 Guaranty. Kraft Foods hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees (the undertaking of Kraft Foods contained in this Article VIII being the “Guaranty”) the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of Kraft Foods Global
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise (such obligations being the “Obligations”), and any and all expenses (including counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders in enforcing any rights under the Guaranty.
SECTION 8.02 Guaranty Absolute. Kraft
Foods guarantees that the Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders with respect thereto. The liability of Kraft Foods under this Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:
(a) any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

(b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any
other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement;
(c) any exchange, release or
non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations; or

(d) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Kraft Foods Global
or Kraft Foods.
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Kraft Foods Global or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

SECTION 8.03 Waivers.
(a) Kraft Foods hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect to any of the Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or
any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against Kraft Foods Global or any other Person or any collateral.

(b) Kraft Foods hereby irrevocably waives any claims or other rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against Kraft Foods Global that
arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the obligations of Kraft Foods, under this Guaranty or this












Agreement, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender against Kraft Foods Global or any collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from
Kraft Foods Global, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right. If any amount shall be paid to Kraft Foods in violation of the preceding
sentence at any time prior to the later of the cash payment in full of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty and the Termination Date, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and this
Guaranty, or to be held as collateral for any Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guaranty thereafter arising. Kraft Foods acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by
this Agreement and this Guaranty and that the waiver set forth in this Section 8.03(b) is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
SECTION 8.04 Continuing Guaranty. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of the Obligations (including any and all
Obligations which remain outstanding after the Termination Date) and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) be binding upon each of Kraft Foods and its successors and assigns, and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and their respective successors, transferees and assigns.

automatically be released from the Guaranty and from all other claims or obligations under or in respect of this Agreement and the Notes and any other agreement entered into in connection herewith. The Administrative Agent, at the request of Kraft
Foods Global or Kraft Foods and at the sole expense of Kraft Foods Global, shall execute and deliver to Kraft Foods Global and Kraft Foods all releases or other documents reasonably requested to evidence such termination and release.

Commitments of consenting Lenders and to compensate such Lenders for consenting to such extension; provided that (i) no amendment permitted by this parenthetical shall reduce the amount of or defer any payment of principal, interest or
fees to non-extending Lenders or otherwise adversely affect the rights of non-extending Lenders under this Agreement and (ii) the opportunity to agree to such extension and receive such compensation shall be offered on equal terms to all the

any Indemnified Party, in each case in connection with or arising out of, or in connection with the preparation for or defense of, any investigation, litigation, or proceeding (i) related to this Agreement or any of the other documents
delivered hereunder, the Advances or any transaction or proposed transaction (whether or not consummated) in which any proceeds of any Borrowing are applied or proposed to be applied, directly or indirectly, by Kraft Foods Global, whether or not
such Indemnified Party is a party to such transaction, or (ii) related to Kraft Foods Global’s or Kraft Foods’ consummation of any transaction or proposed transaction contemplated hereby (whether or not consummated) or entering into

case whether or not an Indemnified Party is a party thereto and whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by Kraft Foods Global, Kraft Foods or any other Person; provided, however, that Kraft Foods Global
shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnified Party from or against any portion of such claims, damages, losses, liabilities or expenses that is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party.
SECTION 9.05 Right of Set-Off. Upon (i) the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.02 to authorize the Administrative Agent to declare the Advances due and payable
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time after providing written notice to the Administrative Agent of its intention to do so, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set
off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or any of its affiliates to or for the credit or the account of Kraft Foods Global
(or, prior to the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods) against any and all of the obligations of Kraft Foods Global (or, prior to the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods) now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand
under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender shall promptly notify Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods, as the case may be, after any such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender and its affiliates under this Section 9.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off)
that such Lender and its affiliates may have.











SECTION 9.06 Binding Effect. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of Kraft Foods Global, Kraft Foods, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns, except that neither Kraft Foods Global nor Kraft Foods shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or
any interest herein without the prior written consent of each of the Lenders.

contained herein, upon consummation of the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods shall automatically cease to be a party to this Agreement and this Agreement shall no longer be binding upon or inure to the benefit of Kraft Foods.

Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a

of an assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto), other than Section 9.11.

Section 406 of ERISA; (vii) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (viii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.
(c) Agent’s Acceptance. Upon its receipt of an
Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with any Pro Rata Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and
Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to Kraft
Foods Global.











(d) Register. The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender
from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and Kraft Foods Global, Kraft Foods, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Kraft Foods Global or any Lender (or, prior to the Spin-Off, Kraft Foods) at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(e) Sale of Participation. Each Lender may sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes
held by it), subject to the following:
(i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, its Commitment to Kraft Foods Global hereunder) shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii)
Kraft Foods Global, Kraft Foods, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement,

(iv) each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12 and 2.15 (subject to the limitations and
requirements of those Sections, including the requirements to provide forms and/or certificates pursuant to Section 2.15(e) or (f)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section,
(v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to
approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any consent to any departure by Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or
interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts
payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, and
(vi) a participant shall not
be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.12 and 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
participant is made with Kraft Foods Global’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).











Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of the Kraft Foods Global, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant’s interest in the Advances or other obligations
under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the
owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(f) Disclosure
of Information. Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any
information relating to Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods or any of their respective Subsidiaries received by it from such Lender.

(g) Regulation A Security Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time
create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank or central bank performing similar
functions in accordance with Regulation A.
(h) Replacement of Lenders. In the event that (i) any Lender shall
have delivered a notice pursuant to Section 2.13, (ii) Kraft Foods Global shall be required to make additional payments to or for the account of any Lender under Section 2.12 or 2.15, (iii) any Lender (a “Non-Consenting
Lender”) shall withhold its consent to any amendment that requires the consent of all the Lenders and that has been consented to by the Required Lenders or (iv) any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender, Kraft Foods Global shall have
the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (A) to terminate the Commitment of such Lender or (B) to require such Lender to transfer and assign at par and without recourse (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.07) all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more other financial institutions acceptable to Kraft Foods Global and approved by the Administrative Agent (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), which shall assume such obligations; provided, that (x) in the case of any replacement of a Non-Consenting Lender, each assignee shall have consented to the relevant amendment,
(y) no such termination or assignment shall conflict with any law or any rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority and (z) Kraft Foods Global or the assignee (or assignees), as the case may be, shall pay to each affected
Lender in immediately available funds on the date of such termination or assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Advances made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it
hereunder. Kraft Foods Global will not have the right to terminate the commitment of any Lender, or to require any Lender to assign its rights and interests hereunder, if, prior to such termination or assignment, as a result of a













waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Kraft Foods Global to require such termination or assignment cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that, if Kraft Foods Global elects
to replace such Lender in accordance with this Section 9.07, it shall promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance to evidence the assignment and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note (if
Notes have been issued in respect of such Lender’s Advances) subject to such Assignment and Acceptance; provided that the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Acceptance shall not render such assignment invalid and
such assignment shall be recorded in the Register.
SECTION 9.08 Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the substantive laws of the State of New York without regard to choice of law doctrines.
SECTION 9.09 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall
be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier or email shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.
SECTION 9.10 Jurisdiction, Etc.

(a) Submission to Jurisdiction; Service of Process. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each of Kraft Foods
Global and Kraft Foods hereby irrevocably consents to the service of process in any such action or proceeding in any such court by the mailing thereof by any parties hereto by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to Kraft Foods Global or
Kraft Foods, as applicable, at its address specified pursuant to Section 9.02. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or to bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the Notes in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(b) Waivers.

(i) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New York state or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.











(ii) To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of Kraft Foods Global
and the Lenders shall not assert and hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto or any of their respective affiliates, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
damages) (whether or not the claim therefor is based on contract, tort or duty imposed by any applicable legal requirement) arising out of, in connection with, as a result of, or in any way related to this Agreement or any related document or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or referred to herein or therein, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Advance or the use of the proceeds thereof or any act or omission or event occurring in connection
therewith, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any such claim or any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor. For the avoidance of doubt, the
waiver of claims for such damages against Kraft Foods Global shall not limit the indemnity obligations set forth in Section 9.04(c).
(iii) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY AGREES TO WAIVE ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING HEREUNDER OR ANY DEALINGS BETWEEN
THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT

BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS WAIVER IN ITS RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY HERETO FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS
REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING
(OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SECTION 9.10(B) AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS HERETO OR ANY OF
THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE ADVANCES MADE HEREUNDER. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.











SECTION 9.11 Confidentiality. None of the Agents nor any Lender shall disclose any
confidential information relating to Kraft Foods Global or Kraft Foods to any other Person without the consent of Kraft Foods Global, other than (a) to such Agent’s or such Lender’s affiliates and their officers, directors, employees,
agents and advisors and, as contemplated by Section 9.07(f), to actual or prospective assignees and participants, and then, in each such case, only on a confidential basis; provided, however, that such actual or prospective
assignee or participant shall have been made aware of this Section 9.11 and shall have agreed to be bound by its provisions as if it were a party to this Agreement, (b) as required by any law, rule or regulation or judicial process, and
(c) as requested or required by any state, federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or banking or other financial institutions.

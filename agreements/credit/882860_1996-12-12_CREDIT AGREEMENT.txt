acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

Section  1.1  Defined  Terms.  As used in this  Agreement  the
following terms shall have the following  respective meanings (and such meanings
shall be equally  applicable  to both the  singular and plural form of the terms
defined, as the context may require):

"Adjusted  CD Rate":  With  respect  to each  Interest  Period
applicable to a CD Rate Advance,  the sum (rounded upward, if necessary,  to the
next  one  hundredth  of one  percent)  of (a) the rate per  annum  obtained  by
dividing  (i) the CD Rate as of the first day of the  Interest  Period,  by (ii)
1.00  minus the  Domestic  Reserve  Percentage,  plus (b) the  annual  rate most
recently  estimated by the Bank as the then current net annual  assessment  rate
payable  by the  Bank  to the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (or any
successor)  for insuring time  deposits  made in Dollars at the Bank's  domestic
offices,  plus (c) the cost  (converted  to an  equivalent  rate per  annum)  of
customary  brokerage fees incurred by the Bank in obtaining funds by the sale of
its negotiable certificates of deposit.
<PAGE>
"Adjusted  Fixed  Eurodollar   Rate":  With  respect  to  each
Interest Period applicable to a Fixed Eurodollar Rate Advance, the rate (rounded

minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage.

"Adjusted   Floating   Eurodollar   Rate":   On  any  date  of
determination, the rate (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next one-hundredth
of one percent)  determined by dividing the Eurodollar Rate on such date by 1.00
minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage.

"Advance":  Any portion of the  outstanding  Loans as to which
the  Borrower  has elected one of the  available  interest  rate options and, if
applicable,  an  Interest  Period.  An Advance  may be a Fixed  Eurodollar  Rate
Advance,  a Floating  Eurodollar Rate Advance,  a CD Rate Advance or a Reference
Rate Advance.

"Advisory  Contracts":  Contracts of the type  described in 15
U.S.C. ss. 80a-15(a).

Person that,  directly or  indirectly,  controls,  is  controlled by or is under
common control with, the Person referred to, (b) each Person which  beneficially

of voting stock of the Person referred to (or if the Person referred to is not a

Person,  twenty-five  percent of more of the voting  stock (or if such Person is
not a corporation,  twenty-five percent or more of the equity interest) of which
is beneficially  owned or held,  directly or indirectly,  by the Person referred
to, and (d) each of such  Person's  officers,  directors,  joint  venturers  and
partners.  The term  control  (including  the terms  "controlled  by" and "under
common control with") means the possession,  directly, of the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of the Person in question.

determination  for a Floating  Eurodollar  Advance  and on the first day of each

such Interest Period, in each case determined based on the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio  calculated as of the end of the Measurement  Period ended on the last day
of the most  recently  completed  fiscal  quarter  for  which the  Borrower  has

which period the Borrower may borrow,  repay and reborrow in accordance

be obtained and maintained, at the election of the Borrower but subject
to  the  limitations  hereof,  as  Reference  Rate  Advances,  Floating
Eurodollar  Rate Advances,  Fixed  Eurodollar  Rate Advances or CD Rate
Advances.

the Borrower for Revolving  Loans  hereunder  shall be in writing or by
telephone  and must be given so as to be received by the Bank not later

requested  as  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances and not later than 12:00 noon
(Minneapolis  time)  on  the  requested  Revolving  Loan  Date  if  the
Revolving  Loans are  requested as CD Rate  Advances or Reference  Rate

irrevocable and shall be deemed a  representation  by the Borrower that
on the  requested  Revolving  Loan Date and after giving  effect to the

Loans  hereunder  shall specify (i) the requested  Revolving Loan Date,
(ii) the aggregate  amount of Revolving  Loans to be made on such date,
which shall be in a minimum amount of $100,000 or, if more, an integral
multiple  thereof,  (iii) whether such Revolving Loans are to be funded
as Reference Rate Advances,  Floating  Eurodollar Rate Advances,  Fixed
Eurodollar Rate Advances or CD Rate Advances and (iv) in the case of CD
Rate Advances or Fixed  Eurodollar  Rate Advances,  the duration of the
initial Interest Period  applicable  thereto.  The Bank may rely on any
telephone  request for Revolving  Loans  hereunder which it believes in
good faith to be genuine;  and the Borrower  hereby waives the right to
dispute  the  Bank's  record  of the terms of such  telephone  request.
Unless the Bank determines that any applicable  condition  specified in
Article III has not been satisfied, the Bank will make available to the
Borrower at the Bank's  principal  office in Minneapolis,  Minnesota in
Immediately Available Funds not later than 3:00 p.m. (Minneapolis time)

or any portion of the Term Loan as Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  and not
later than 12:00 noon (Minneapolis  time) one Business Day prior to the
Transformation  Date if the Borrower elects to maintain all of the Term
Loan as CD Rate Advances or Reference Rate Advances, the Borrower shall

Advances and  payments;  provided,  however that the failure by the Bank to make
any such entry or any error in making  such entry  shall not limit or  otherwise
affect the  obligation of the Borrower  hereunder  and on the Note,  and, in all
events, the principal amounts owing by the Borrower in respect of the Note shall
be the  aggregate  amount of all Loans  made by the Bank  less all  payments  of
principal thereof made by the Borrower.

Section 2.4  Conversions and  Continuations.  On the terms and
subject to the  limitations  hereof,  the Borrower  shall have the option at any
time and from time to time to convert  all or any portion of the  Advances  into

Maturity  Date,  the Borrower  shall deposit into the Holding  Account an amount
sufficient  to cause the amount  deposited  in the Holding  Account to equal the
undrawn face amount of such outstanding Letter of Credit. At any time after such
deposit is made and all outstanding  Obligations,  other than  Obligations  with
respect to such outstanding  Letters of Credit,  have been paid in full, if such
outstanding  Letter of Credit  expires or is  reduced  without  the full  amount
thereof having been drawn,  the Bank shall withdraw from the Holding Account and
deliver  to the  Borrower  an amount  equal to the amount by which the amount on
deposit in the Holding  Account  exceeds the  aggregate  undrawn  face amount of
outstanding  Letters  of  Credit  (after  giving  effect to such  expiration  or
reduction).  In addition,  the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan on
the Transformation Date shall be payable in sixteen quarterly installments, each
in an  amount  equal  to  one-sixteenth  of  the  Total  Outstandings  as of the
Transformation  Date, on each subsequent  Quarterly  Payment Date beginning with
the first Quarterly Payment Date after the Transformation Date.

Section 2.7  Optional  Prepayments.  The  Borrower  may prepay
Reference Rate Advances,  in whole or in part, at any time,  without  premium or
penalty.  Any such prepayment must be accompanied by accrued and unpaid interest
on the amount prepaid.  Each partial  prepayment shall be in an aggregate amount
for all the Banks of $100,000 or an integral  multiple  thereof.  Except upon an
acceleration   following  an  Event  of  Default  or  upon  termination  of  the
Commitment, the Borrower may pay Fixed Rate Advances only on the last day of the
Interest  Period   applicable   thereto.   Amounts  paid  (unless  following  an
acceleration  or upon  termination  of the  Commitment)  or  prepaid  under this
Section 2.7 during the  Revolving  Period may be  reborrowed  upon the terms and
subject to the conditions and  limitations  of this  Agreement.  Amounts paid or
prepaid  on the Term  Loan  under  this  Section  2.7  shall be  applied  to the
installments due on the Term Loan in the inverse order of their maturities.

Part B -- Terms of the Letter of Credit Facility

Section 2.8  Letters of Credit.  Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, the Bank agrees to (a) issue Letters of Credit
for the  account of the  Borrower  from time to time during the  Revolving  Loan
Period in such amounts as the Borrower  shall  request,  and (b) renew  existing
Letters  of Credit  during the Term Loan  Period,  in each case in an amount not
exceeding  the lesser of (i) the amount of the Letter of Credit  being  renewed,
and (ii) the amount of the Total  Outstandings on the date of such renewal minus
the  amount of  scheduled  payments  under  Section  2.6  during the term of the
renewal  Letter of Credit;  provided  that no Letter of Credit will be issued in
any amount which,  after giving effect to such  issuance,  would cause (A) Total
Outstandings to exceed the Commitment  Amount, or (B) the Letter of Credit Usage
to exceed $4,500,000.

Section 2.9 Procedures for Letters of Credit. Each request for
a Letter of Credit shall be made by the Borrower in writing, by telex, facsimile
transmission  or  electronic  conveyance  received  by the  Bank by  2:00  p.m.,
Minneapolis  time,  on a Business  Day which is not less than one  Business  Day
preceding the requested  date of issuance  (which shall also be a Business Day).
Each  request  for a Letter of Credit  shall be deemed a  representation  by the
Borrower  that on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and after giving
effect thereto the applicable  conditions specified in Article III have been and
will be satisfied. The Bank may require that such request be made on such letter
of credit application and reimbursement agreement form as the Bank may from time
to  time  specify,  along  with  satisfactory  evidence  of  the  authority  and
incumbency of the officials of the Borrower making such request.

Section 2.10 Terms of Letters of Credit. Letters of Credit may
be issued in support  of  obligations  of EAHC to  NationsBanc  existing  on the
Closing  Date  pursuant to the Asset  Purchase  Agreement  dated as of August 7,
1994;  provided  that the Bank  may  require  as a  condition  precedent  to the
issuance of the first  Letter of Credit  that  documents  in form and  substance
satisfactory to the Bank have been executed by NationsBanc  releasing collateral
of EAHC pledged to NationsBanc  to secure such  obligation in an amount not less
than the face amount of such Letter of Credit. All Letters of Credit must expire
not later than the  Maturity  Date.  No Letter of Credit may have a term  longer
than 12 months.

Section 2.11 Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings.  If
the Bank has received documents purporting to draw under a Letter of Credit that
the Bank believes conform to the requirements of the Letter of Credit, or if the
Bank has decided that it will comply with the Borrower's written or oral request
or authorization to pay a drawing on any Letter of Credit that the Bank does not
believe conforms to the requirements of the Letter of Credit, it will notify the
Borrower of that fact. The Borrower shall reimburse the Bank by 9:30 a.m.
<PAGE>
(Minneapolis time) on the day on which such drawing is to be paid in Immediately
Available Funds in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing.  Any amount by
which the Borrower has failed to reimburse  the Bank for the full amount of such
drawing by 10:00 a.m. on the date on which the Bank in its notice indicated that
it would pay such drawing,  until reimbursed from the proceeds of Loans pursuant
to Section 2.15 or out of funds available in the Holding Account,  is an "Unpaid
Drawing."

Section  2.12  Obligations  Absolute.  The  obligation  of the
Borrower under Section 2.11 to repay the Bank for any amount drawn on any Letter
of Credit  and to repay the Bank for any  Advances  made under  Section  2.15 to
cover Unpaid Drawings shall be absolute,  unconditional  and irrevocable,  shall
continue for so long as any Letter of Credit is outstanding  notwithstanding any
termination of this Agreement, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement,  under all circumstances whatsoever,  including without
limitation the following circumstances:

(a) Any lack of  validity or  enforceability  of any Letter of
Credit;

(b) The existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
which  the  Borrower  may  have  or  claim  at  any  time  against  any
beneficiary,  transferee  or  holder of any  Letter  of Credit  (or any
Person  for whom any such  beneficiary,  transferee  or  holder  may be
acting),  the Bank or any other Person,  whether in  connection  with a
Letter of Credit, this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby,
or any unrelated transaction; or

(c) Any statement or any other  document  presented  under any
Letter  of  Credit  proving  to  be  forged,  fraudulent,   invalid  or
insufficient  in any respect or any  statement  therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect whatsoever.

Neither the Bank nor its  officers,  directors or  employees  shall be liable or
responsible  for, and the  obligations  of the Borrower to the Bank shall not be
impaired by:

(i)      The use which may be made of any  Letter of Credit or
for  any  acts  or  omissions  of  any   beneficiary,
transferee or holder thereof in connection therewith;

(ii)     The   validity,   sufficiency   or   genuineness   of
documents,  or of any endorsements  thereon,  even if
such documents or endorsements should, in fact, prove
to be in any or all respects  invalid,  insufficient,
fraudulent or forged;
<PAGE>
(iii)    The  acceptance by the Bank of documents  that appear
on their face to be in order, without  responsibility
for further  investigation,  regardless of any notice
or information to the contrary; or

(iv)     Any other  action of the Bank in making or failing to
make  payment  under any  Letter of Credit if in good
faith and in  conformity  with U.S. or foreign  laws,
regulations or customs applicable thereto.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall have a claim against the Bank,
and the Bank shall be liable to the  Borrower,  to the  extent,  but only to the
extent,  of any direct,  as opposed to  consequential,  damages  suffered by the
Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the Bank's willful  misconduct
or gross negligence in determining  whether documents presented under any Letter
of Credit comply with the terms thereof.

Section  2.13  Increased  Cost for  Letters of Credit.  If any
Regulatory  Change  shall  either  (a)  impose,  modify or make  applicable  any
reserve,  deposit,  capital adequacy or similar  requirement  against Letters of
Credit issued by the Bank, or (b) shall impose on the Bank any other  conditions
affecting this  Agreement or any Letter of Credit;  and the result of any of the
foregoing  is to  increase  the cost to the Bank of issuing or  maintaining  any
Letter of Credit,  or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the
Bank  hereunder,  then,  upon demand  (which  demand  shall be given by the Bank
promptly after it determines  such  increased  cost or reduction),  the Borrower
shall pay to the Bank the  additional  amount or amounts as will  compensate the
Bank for such  increased  cost or  reduction.  A  certificate  submitted  to the
Borrower  by the Bank  setting  forth the basis  for the  determination  of such
additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Bank as aforesaid shall
be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent error.

Part C -- General

Section  2.14  Optional  Reduction  of  Commitment  Amount  or
Termination  of  Commitment.  The Borrower may, at any time,  upon not less than
thirty days prior written notice to the Bank, reduce the Commitment Amount, with
any such  reduction  in a minimum  amount  of  $1,000,000,  or,  if more,  in an
integral multiple of $250,000;  provided,  however, that the Borrower may not at
any time reduce the Commitment Amount below the Total Outstandings. The Borrower
may, at any time when there are no Letters of Credit outstanding,  upon not less
than thirty days prior written  notice to the Bank,  terminate the Commitment in
its entirety.
<PAGE>
Section  2.15 Loans to Cover  Unpaid  Drawings.  Whenever  any
Unpaid Drawing exists for which there are not then funds in the Holding  Account
to cover  the  same,  the Bank is  authorized  (and the  Borrower  does  here so
authorize  the  Bank)  to,  and  shall,  make a  Revolving  Loan or,  after  the
Transformation  Date,  increase the Term Loan to the Borrower in an amount equal
to the amount of the Unpaid  Drawing.  The Bank shall apply the proceeds of such
Revolving Loan or increase directly to reimburse itself for such Unpaid Drawing.
If at the time the Bank makes a Loan pursuant to the provisions of this Section,
the applicable conditions precedent specified in Article III shall not have been
satisfied,  the Borrower shall pay to the Bank interest on the funds so advanced
at a floating  rate per annum  equal to the sum of the  Reference  Rate plus the
Applicable Margin plus two percent (2.00%).

Section 2.16 Fees.

2.16(a)  Closing Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Bank on the date of this Agreement a closing fee (the "Closing Fee") in
an amount equal to $1,500.

2.16(b) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
Bank fees (the "Commitment Fees") in an amount determined by applying a
rate of  three-eighths of one percent (0.375%) per annum to the average
daily  Unused  Commitment  for the period from the Closing  Date to the
Termination  Date.  Such Commitment Fees are payable in arrears on each
Quarterly Payment Date and on the Termination Date.

2.16(c)  Letter of Credit  Fees.  For each  Letter of
Credit issued,  the Borrower shall pay to the Bank, in advance  payable
on the date of issuance,  a fee (a "Letter of Credit Fee") in an amount
determined by applying a per annum rate equal to the Applicable  Margin
for CD Rate  Advances then in effect to the original face amount of the
Letter  of  Credit  for the  period  from the date of  issuance  to the
scheduled  expiration date of such Letter of Credit. In addition to the
Letter of Credit Fee,  the Borrower  shall pay to the Bank,  on demand,
all issuance,  amendment,  drawing and other fees regularly  charged by
the  Bank to its  letter  of  credit  customers  and all  out-of-pocket
expenses  incurred  by  the  Bank  in  connection  with  the  issuance,
amendment, administration or payment of any Letter of Credit.

Section 2.17  Computation.  Commitment Fees,  Letter of Credit
Fees and  interest  on the Loans  shall be  computed on the basis of actual days
elapsed and a year of 360 days.

Section 2.18 Payments.  Payments and  prepayments of principal
of, and interest on, the Note and all fees, expenses and other obligations under
this
<PAGE>
Agreement  payable to the Bank shall be made without setoff or  counterclaim  in
Immediately  Available Funds not later than 3:00 p.m.  (Minneapolis time) on the
dates  called  for  under  this  Agreement  to the  Bank at its main  office  in
Minneapolis,  Minnesota.  Funds received after such time shall be deemed to have
been  received  on the  next  Business  Day.  Whenever  any  payment  to be made
hereunder  or on the Note  shall  be  stated  to be due on a day  which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and
such extension of time, in the case of a payment of principal, shall be included
in the computation of any interest on such principal payment.

Section  2.19  Use  of  Loan  Proceeds.  The  proceeds  of the
Revolving Loans shall be used by the Borrower and the Subsidiaries (i) for their
general business purposes in a manner not in conflict with any of the Borrower's
covenants  in this  Agreement  (including,  subject to the terms and  conditions
hereof,  the  making of  Restricted  Payments)  and (ii)  otherwise  for (A) the
acquisition  of Funds to be managed by the  Borrower and the  Subsidiaries,  for
costs  associated  with starting new Funds to be managed by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries,  and for other  costs  associated  with  increasing  assets  under
management by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries,  and (B) to finance the payment
of sales  commissions on sales of B Shares in connection  with which  Contingent
Deferred Sales Charges are payable to PASI. For the proceeds of a Revolving Loan
to be applied  pursuant to Section  2.19(ii),  the Borrower shall provide to the
Bank  documentation  evidencing  the  costs  to be paid,  in form and  substance
satisfactory to the Bank.

Section 2.20 Interest Rate Not  Ascertainable,  Etc. If, on or
prior  to the  date  for  determining  the  Adjusted  CD  Rate  or the  Adjusted
Eurodollar Rate for any CD Rate Advance or the Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Bank
determines (which  determination shall be conclusive and binding,  absent error)
that:

(a)  deposits in dollars (in the  applicable  amount)
are not being made  available  to the Bank in the  relevant  market for
such Interest Period, or

(b) the Adjusted CD Rate or the  Adjusted  Eurodollar
Rate, as applicable, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
the Bank of funding or maintaining CD Rate Advances and Eurodollar Rate
Advances for such Interest Period,

the Bank shall  forthwith  give notice to the  Borrower  of such  determination,
whereupon  the  obligation  of the Bank to make or  continue,  or to convert any
Advances to, CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances, as applicable,  shall
be suspended until the Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances  giving
rise to
<PAGE>
such  suspension  no longer  exist.  While any such  suspension  continues,  all
further Advances by the Bank as CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances, as
applicable,  shall be made as Reference Rate Advances.  No such suspension shall
affect the interest rate then in effect during the  applicable  Interest  Period
for any CD Rate Advance or Eurodollar Rate Advance  outstanding at the time such
suspension is imposed.

Section 2.21 Increased Cost. If any Regulatory Change:

(a) shall  subject the Bank to any tax, duty or other
charge  with  respect  to its  CD  Rate  Advances  or  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances,  the Note,  or its  obligation  to make CD Rate  Advances  or
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  or shall  change the basis of  taxation  of
payment to the Bank of the principal of or interest on CD Rate Advances
or  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  or any other  amounts  due  under  this
Agreement in respect of CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances or
its  obligation to make CD Rate  Advances or  Eurodollar  Rate Advances
(except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of the
Bank imposed by the  jurisdiction in which the Bank's  principal office
is located); or

(b)  shall  impose,  modify  or deem  applicable  any
reserve,  special deposit,  capital  requirement or similar requirement
(including,  without  limitation,  any such requirement  imposed by the
Board,  but excluding with respect to any CD Rate Advance or Eurodollar
Rate Advance any such requirement to the extent included in calculating
the applicable  Adjusted CD Rate or Adjusted  Eurodollar  Rate) against
assets of,  deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
the Bank's  applicable  lending  office or shall impose on the Bank (or
its  applicable  lending  office)  or on the United  States  market for
certificates  of deposit or the interbank  Eurodollar  market any other
condition  affecting its CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar  Rate Advances,
the Note or its obligation to make CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar  Rate
Advances;

and the result of any of the  foregoing  is to increase  the cost to the Bank of
making or  maintaining  any CD Rate Advances or Eurodollar  Rate Advance,  or to
reduce  the  amount of any sum  received  or  receivable  by the Bank under this
Agreement or under the Note, then,  within 30 days after demand by the Bank, the
Borrower  shall  pay to the Bank  such  additional  amount  or  amounts  as will
compensate  the Bank for such increased  cost or reduction;  provided,  that the
Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any such additional amount (i) unless the
Bank shall first have  notified  the Borrower in writing that it intends to seek
such  compensation  pursuant  to  this  Section,  or  (ii)  to the  extent  such
additional amount is
<PAGE>
attributable  to the  period  ending 91 days prior to the date of the first such
notice with respect to such Regulatory Change (the "Excluded Period"), except to
the extent any amount is  attributable to the Excluded Period as a result of the
retroactive  application of the applicable  Regulatory  Change. A certificate of
the Bank claiming compensation under this Section,  setting forth the additional
amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder  and stating in  reasonable  detail
the basis for the charge and the method of  computation,  shall be conclusive in
the  absence  of  error.  In  determining  such  amount,  the  Bank  may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Failure on the part of the Bank to
demand  compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or
receivable  with respect to any Interest Period shall not constitute a waiver of
the Bank's rights to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in
amounts received or receivable in any subsequent Interest Period.

Section 2.22 Illegality.  If any Regulatory  Change shall make
it unlawful or impossible for the Bank to make,  maintain or fund any Eurodollar
Rate Advances or CD Rate Advances, the Bank shall notify the Borrower, whereupon
the  obligation of the Bank to make or continue,  or to convert any Advances to,
Eurodollar  Rate Advances or CD Rate Advances shall be suspended  until the Bank
notifies the Borrower that the  circumstances  giving rise to such suspension no
longer  exist.  If the Bank  determines  that it may not  lawfully  continue  to
maintain  any CD Rate  Advances or  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances to the end of the
applicable  Interest  Period,  the  affected  Advances  shall  be  automatically
converted to Reference  Rate Advances as of the date of the Bank's  notice,  and
upon the  conversion  of any CD Rate  Advances or  Eurodollar  Rate Advances the
Borrower shall indemnify the Bank in accordance with Section 2.24.

Section  2.23  Increased  Capital  Requirements.  In the event
that,  as a result of any  Regulatory  Change,  compliance  by the Bank with any
applicable law or governmental rule, requirement, regulation, guideline or order
(whether  or not having the force of law)  regarding  capital  adequacy  has the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the Bank's  capital as a consequence of
the Commitment or amounts outstanding under the Note to a level below that which
the Bank would have achieved but for such compliance  (taking into consideration
the Bank's  policies with respect to capital  adequacy),  then from time to time
the Borrower  shall pay to the Bank,  within thirty days after written demand by
the Bank, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such
reduction;  provided  that the  Borrower  shall not be obligated to pay any such
additional  amount (i) unless the Bank shall first have notified the Borrower in
writing that it intends to seek such compensation  pursuant to this Section,  or
(ii) to the extent such  additional  amount is attributable to the period ending
91 days  prior  to the  date of the  first  such  notice  with  respect  to such
Regulatory  Change (the "Excluded  Period"),  except to the extent any amount is
attributable to the Excluded  Period as a result of the retroactive  application
of the applicable  Regulatory  Change. A certificate,  which shall be conclusive
except for manifest  error,  as to the amount of any such  reduction  (including
calculations  in reasonable  detail showing how the Bank computed such
<PAGE>
reduction and a statement  that the Bank has not allocated to the  Commitment or
amounts  outstanding  under the Note a  proportionately  greater  amount of such
reduction than is  attributable  to each of its other  commitments to lend or to
each of its other outstanding  credit extensions that are affected  similarly by
such  compliance by the Bank,  whether or not the Bank  allocates any portion of
such  reduction  to such  other  commitments  or  credit  extensions,  shall  be
furnished promptly by the Bank to the Borrower.

Section 2.24 Funding  Losses;  CD Rate Advances and Eurodollar
Rate Advances. The Borrower shall compensate the Bank, upon its written request,
for all losses,  expenses and  liabilities  (including  any interest paid by the
Bank to lenders of funds  borrowed  by it to make or carry CD Rate  Advances  or
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances to the extent not recovered by the Bank in connection
with the re-employment of such funds and including loss of anticipated  profits)
which the Bank may sustain:  (i) if for any reason,  other than a default by the
Bank, a funding of a CD Rate Advance or a Eurodollar Rate Advance does not occur
on the date specified  therefor in the  Borrower's  request or notice as to such
Advance  under Section 2.2 or 2.4, or (ii) if, for whatever  reason  (including,
but not limited to,  acceleration of the maturity of Loans following an Event of
Default),  any repayment of a CD Rate Advance or a Eurodollar Rate Advance, or a
conversion  pursuant to Section 2.22,  occurs on any day other than the last day
of the Interest Period applicable  thereto.  The Bank's request for compensation
shall  set  forth  the  basis  for the  amount  requested  and  shall be  final,
conclusive and binding, absent error.

Section 2.25  Discretion of Bank as to Manner of Funding.  The
Bank shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of CD Rate  Advances and
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  in any  manner it may  elect,  it being  understood,
however,  that for the purposes of this Agreement all  determinations  hereunder
(including, but not limited to, determinations under Section 2.24) shall be made
as if the Bank had actually  funded and  maintained  each CD Rate Advance during
the Interest Period for such Advances  through the issuance of its  certificates
of  deposit  having a  maturity  corresponding  to the last day of the  Interest
Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the CD Rate, and as if the Bank had
actually  funded and maintained  each Fixed  Eurodollar  Rate Advance during the
Interest  Period for such  Advance  through the  purchase  of deposits  having a
maturity  corresponding  to the last day of the  Interest  Period and bearing an
interest rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce  the Bank to enter into this  Agreement  and to make
Loans hereunder, the Borrower represents and warrants to the Bank:

Section 4.1  Organization,  Standing,  Etc.  The Borrower is a
corporation  duly  incorporated  and validly existing and in good standing under
the  laws  of the  jurisdiction  of its  incorporation  and  has  all  requisite
corporate  power and  authority  to carry on its business as now  conducted,  to
enter into the Loan Documents or  reaffirmations  thereof to which it is a party
and to perform its obligations  under the Loan Documents to which it is a party.
EAHC is a corporation duly  incorporated,  validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the  jurisdiction of its  incorporation  and has all requisite
corporate  power and  authority  to carry on its business as now  conducted,  to
enter into the Loan Documents or reaffirmations  thereof to which it is a party,
and to perform its obligations  under the Loan Documents to which it is a party.
Each Subsidiary is a corporation  duly  incorporated and validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the  jurisdiction of its  incorporation  and has
all  requisite  corporate  power and  authority  to carry on its business as now
conducted.  Each of EAHC,  the  Borrower  and the  Subsidiaries  (a)  holds  all
certificates  of  authority,  licenses  and  permits  necessary  to carry on the
business as now conducted in each  jurisdiction  in which it is carrying on such
business,  except  where the  failure  to hold such  certificates,  licenses  or
permits would not have a material  adverse  effect on the business,  operations,
property,  assets or condition,  financial or otherwise, of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and (b) is duly qualified and in good standing as
a  foreign  corporation  in each  jurisdiction  in which  the  character  of the
properties owned,  leased or operated by the Borrower or the business  conducted
by the Borrower makes such qualification necessary and the failure so to qualify
would permanently  preclude EAHC, the Borrower or such Subsidiary from enforcing
its rights  with  respect to any assets or expose  EAHC,  the  Borrower  or such
Subsidiary  to any  liability,  which in either  case would be  material  to the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole. PASI is duly registered with the
SEC as a broker-dealer,  is a member in good standing of the NASD, and is not in
arrears with respect to any  assessment  made on it by the SIPC.  Each  Advisory
Subsidiary  is duly  registered  with  the SEC as an  investment  adviser.  PASI
maintains  procedures and internal controls reasonably adapted to insure that it
does not  extend  or  maintain  credit  to or for its  customers  other  than in
accordance  with the  provisions of  Regulation T of the Board,  and officers of
PASI regularly  supervise its activities and the activities of employees of PASI
to reasonably ensure that PASI does not extend
<PAGE>
or  maintain  credit  to or for  customers  other  than in  accordance  with the
provisions of Regulation T of the Board.

Section  4.2  Authorization   and  Validity.   The  execution,
delivery and  performance by each of the Borrower,  each  Subsidiary and EAHC of
the Loan  Documents to which it is a party or  reaffirmations  thereof have been
duly  authorized by all necessary  corporate  action,  and Loan  Documents  when
executed  will  constitute  the  legal,  valid and  binding  obligations  of the
Borrower,  each  Subsidiary  and  EAHC,  enforceable  against  each  of  them in
accordance  with  their   respective   terms,   subject  to  limitations  as  to
enforceability  which might result from bankruptcy,  insolvency,  moratorium and
other similar laws affecting  creditors' rights generally and general principles
of equity.

Section 4.3 No Conflict;  No Default. The execution,  delivery
and performance by the Borrower,  each Subsidiary and EAHC of the Loan Documents
to which each of them is a party or reaffirmations  thereof will not (a) violate
any  provision  of any law,  statute,  rule or  regulation  or any order,  writ,
judgment,  injunction, decree, determination or award of any court, governmental
agency or arbitrator  presently in effect having  applicability to the Borrower,
such Subsidiary or EAHC, (b) violate or contravene any provision of the Articles
of  Incorporation  or bylaws of the  Borrower,  such  Subsidiary or EAHC, or (c)
result in a breach of or  constitute  a default  under any  agreement,  lease or
instrument to which the Borrower, such Subsidiary or EAHC is a party or by which
they or any of their  properties  may be bound or result in the  creation of any
Lien  thereunder.  None of EAHC,  the Borrower or any  Subsidiary  is in default
under or in violation of any such law, statute, rule or regulation, order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award or any such indenture, loan
or credit agreement or other agreement, lease or instrument in any case in which
the  consequences  of such  default or violation  could have a material  adverse
effect on the business,  operations,  properties, assets or condition (financial
or otherwise)  of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  taken as a whole.  Without
limiting the foregoing,  the Borrower and each Subsidiary are in compliance with
all applicable capital requirements of all governmental  authorities  applicable
to them, including,  without limitation,  Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, as
the same is modified  with respect to PASI in  accordance  with the  undertaking
outlined in  paragraph 2 of the letter dated March 2, 1995 from PASI to the NASD
District  Committee for District No. 2, and as the same may be further  modified
from time to time by the NASD.

Section 4.4 Government Consent. No order,  consent,  approval,
license,  authorization  or validation of, or filing,  recording or registration
with, or exemption by, any  governmental or public body or authority is required
on the part of EAHC, the Borrower or any Subsidiary to authorize, or is required
in connection with the execution,  delivery and performance of, or the legality,
validity,  binding
<PAGE>
effect or enforceability of, the Loan Documents, except for any necessary filing
or recordation of or with respect to any of the Security Documents.

Section 4.5 Financial Statements and Condition. The Borrower's
audited  consolidated  financial  statements  as at  September  30, 1995 and its
unaudited financial  statements as at March 31, 1996, as heretofore furnished to
the Bank,  have been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP on a  consistent  basis
(except for the absence of footnotes and subject to year-end  audit  adjustments
as to the interim  statements) and fairly present the financial condition of the
Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries  as at such  dates  and the  results  of  their
operations  and changes in financial  position for the  respective  periods then
ended.  As of the dates of such financial  statements,  neither the Borrower nor
any Subsidiary had any material obligation,  contingent liability, liability for
taxes or long-term  lease  obligation  which is not reflected in such  financial
statements or in the notes thereto.
Since  September  30, 1995,  there has been no material  adverse  change in the
business, operations,  property, assets or condition, financial or otherwise, of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 4.6  Litigation.  Except as described on Schedule 4.6,
there are no actions,  suits or proceedings  pending or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower,  threatened against or affecting EAHC, the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
or any of their properties  before any court or arbitrator,  or any governmental
department,   board,  agency  or  other  instrumentality  which,  if  determined
adversely to EAHC, the Borrower or any Subsidiary, would have a material adverse
effect  on  the  business,  operations,  property  or  condition  (financial  or
otherwise)  of the  Borrower  and the  Subsidiaries  taken  as a whole or on the
ability of EAHC, the Borrower or any Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
the Loan Documents.

Section 4.7 ERISA. Each Plan is in substantial compliance with
all  applicable  requirements  of ERISA  and the  Code  and  with  all  material
applicable  rulings and regulations issued under the provisions of ERISA and the
Code setting forth those  requirements.  No Reportable Event has occurred and is
continuing  with  respect  to any Plan.  All of the  minimum  funding  standards
applicable  to such  Plans  have been  satisfied  and  there  exists no event or
condition  which would  reasonably be expected to result in the  institution  of
proceedings  to terminate any Plan under Section 4042 of ERISA.  With respect to
each Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, as of the most recent valuation date for
such Plan, the present value (determined on the basis of reasonable  assumptions
employed by the  independent  actuary for such Plan and previously  furnished in
writing  to the Bank) of such  Plan' s  projected  benefit  obligations  did not
exceed the fair market value of such Plan's assets.

Section 4.8 Federal Reserve Regulations.  Neither the Borrower
nor any Subsidiary is engaged principally or as one of its important  activities
in the business of extending  credit for the purpose of  purchasing  or carrying
margin stock
<PAGE>
(as defined in  Regulation U of the Board).  The value of all margin stock owned
by the Borrower does not constitute  more than 25% of the value of the assets of
the Borrower.

Section 4.9 Title to Property;  Leases; Liens;  Subordination.
Each of the Borrower and the  Subsidiaries  has (a) good and marketable title to
its real properties and (b) good and sufficient  title to, or valid,  subsisting
and enforceable leasehold interest in, its other material properties,  including
all real  properties  (other  than  property  disposed of since the date of such
financial  statements  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business).  None  of  such
properties  is subject to a Lien,  except as allowed  under  Section  6.13.  The
Borrower has not subordinated any of its rights under any obligation owing to it
to the rights of any other person.

Section 4.10 Taxes.  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries
has filed all federal,  state and local tax returns required to be filed and has
paid or made provision for the payment of all taxes due and payable  pursuant to
such  returns and  pursuant  to any  assessments  made  against it or any of its
property and all other taxes, fees and other charges imposed on it or any of its
property by any governmental  authority  (other than taxes,  fees or charges the
amount or  validity  of which is  currently  being  contested  in good  faith by
appropriate  proceedings  and with respect to which reserves in accordance  with
GAAP have been provided on the books of the Borrower). The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower in respect of taxes and other governmental
charges  are  adequate  and the  Borrower  knows  of no  proposed  material  tax
assessment against the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any of their assets or of any
basis therefor.

Section 4.11 Trademarks, Patents. Each of the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries  possesses or has the right to use all of the patents,  trademarks,
trade names, service marks and copyrights,  and applications  therefor,  and all
technology,  know-how,  processes,  methods and designs used in or necessary for
the conduct of its business, without known conflict with the rights of others.

Section  4.12  Burdensome  Restrictions.  None  of  EAHC,  the
Borrower or any  Subsidiary is a party to or otherwise  bound by any  indenture,
loan or  credit  agreement  or any lease or other  agreement  or  instrument  or
subject  to any  charter,  corporate  or  partnership  restriction  which  would
foreseeably have a material adverse effect on the business,  properties, assets,
operations  or  condition  (financial  or  otherwise)  of the  Borrower  and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the ability of EAHC or the Borrower to carry
out its obligations under any Loan Document.

Section 4.13 Force Majeure.  Since the date of the most recent
financial  statement  referred to in Section 4.5, the business,  properties  and
other assets of the Borrower and the  Subsidiaries  have not been materially and
adversely  affected  in any way as the  result  of any fire or  other  casualty,
strike,  lockout,  or other  labor
<PAGE>
trouble, embargo, sabotage, confiscation, condemnation, riot, civil disturbance,
activity of armed forces or act of God.

Section 4.14 Investment  Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor
any  Subsidiary  is an  "investment  company"  or a company  "controlled"  by an
investment  company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.

Section 4.15 Public Utility Holding  Company Act.  Neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary  company" of
a holding  company or an  "affiliate"  of a holding  company or of a  subsidiary
company of a holding  company within the meaning of the Public  Utility  Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended.

Section 4.16  Retirement  Benefits.  Except as required  under
Section 4980B of the Code, Section 601 of ERISA or applicable state law, neither
the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is obligated to provide  post-retirement medical
or insurance benefits with respect to employees or former employees.

Section 4.17 Subsidiaries.  Schedule 4.17 sets forth as of the
date of this Agreement a list of all  Subsidiaries and the number and percentage
of the shares of each class of capital stock owned  beneficially or of record by
the Borrower or any Subsidiary therein, and the jurisdiction of incorporation of
each Subsidiary.

Section 4.18 Fund  Agreements.  Schedule 4.18 sets forth as of
the  date  of this  agreement,  a list  of all  Funds  for  which  PAII  acts as
investment  adviser  or PASI acts as  principal  distributor,  and a list of all
related Fund Agreements. All Fund Agreements are in full force and effect.

Section  4.19  Full  Disclosure.   Subject  to  the  following
sentence,  neither the financial  statements  referred to in Section 4.5 nor any
other  certificate,  written  statement,  exhibit or report  furnished  by or on
behalf of the Borrower in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement contains
any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omits to state any  material  fact
necessary  in order to make the  statements  contained  therein not  misleading.
Certificates or statements furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Bank
consisting  of  projections  or forecasts of future  results or events have been
prepared in good faith and based on good faith  estimates and assumptions of the
management of the Borrower,  and the Borrower has no reason to believe that such
projections or forecasts are not reasonable.

Section 5.2 Corporate  Existence.  The Borrower will maintain,
and cause each Subsidiary to maintain,  its corporate existence in good standing
under the laws of its  jurisdiction of  incorporation  and its  qualification to
transact  business  in each  jurisdiction  where  failure  so to  qualify  would
permanently  preclude the Borrower or such  Subsidiary from enforcing its rights
with  respect  to any  material  asset  or would  expose  the  Borrower  or such
Subsidiary to any material  liability;  provided,  however,  that nothing herein
shall prohibit the merger or liquidation of any Subsidiary allowed under Section
6.1.

charges and levies  imposed upon it or its property and all claims or demands of
any kind (including but not limited to those of suppliers,  mechanics, carriers,
warehouses,  landlords and other like Persons) which, if unpaid, might result in
the creation of a Lien upon its property; provided that the foregoing items need
not  be  paid  if  they  are  being  contested  in  good  faith  by  appropriate
proceedings,  and as long as the  Borrower's or such  Subsidiary's  title to its
property is not materially  adversely affected,  its use of such property in the
ordinary  course of its business is not materially  interfered with and adequate
reserves  with  respect  thereto have been set aside on the  Borrower's  or such
Subsidiary's books in accordance with GAAP.

Section 5.5  Inspection.  The Borrower shall permit any Person
designated  by the Bank to visit and  inspect any of the  properties,  corporate

to make  copies of the books of  accounts  and other  financial  records  of the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries, and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts
of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries  with, and to be advised as to the same by,
its officers at such  reasonable  times and intervals as the Bank may designate.
So long as no Event of Default exists, the expenses of the Bank for such visits,
inspections and  examinations  shall be at the expense of the Bank, but any such
visits,  inspections  and  examinations  made  while  any  Event of  Default  is
continuing shall be at the expense of the Borrower.

Section 5.6  Maintenance  of  Properties.  The  Borrower  will
maintain,  and cause each Subsidiary to maintain,  its properties used or useful
in the conduct of its business in good condition,  repair and working order, and

replacements,  betterments and improvements  thereto, all as may be necessary so
that the  business  carried  on in  connection  therewith  may be  properly  and
advantageously conducted at all times.

Section 5.7 Books and  Records.  The Borrower  will keep,  and
will cause each  Subsidiary  to keep,  adequate and proper  records and books of
account in which full and correct entries will be made of its dealings, business
and affairs.

Section 5.8  Compliance.  The Borrower  will comply,  and will
cause each Subsidiary to comply,  in all material respects with all laws, rules,
regulations,  orders, writs, judgments,  injunctions, decrees or awards to which
it may be subject;
<PAGE>
provided,  however,  that  failure  so to  comply  shall not be a breach of this
covenant if such failure does not have, or is not reasonably expected to have, a
materially  adverse effect on the properties,  business,  prospects or condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or such  Subsidiary and the Borrower or
such  Subsidiary  is acting in good faith and with  reasonable  dispatch to cure
such noncompliance.

Section  5.9  Notice of  Litigation.  The  Borrower  will give
prompt written  notice to the Bank of the  commencement  of any action,  suit or
proceeding before any court or arbitrator or any governmental department, board,
agency or other  instrumentality  affecting EAHC, the Borrower or any Subsidiary
or any  property of EAHC,  the Borrower or a  Subsidiary  or to which EAHC,  the
Borrower or a Subsidiary is a party in which an adverse  determination or result
could have a material  adverse effect on the business,  operations,  property or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as
a whole or on the ability of EAHC or the  Borrower  to perform  its  obligations
under the Loan Documents,  stating the nature and status of such action, suit or
proceeding.

Section 5.10 ERISA. The Borrower will maintain, and cause each
Subsidiary  to maintain,  each Plan in compliance  with all material  applicable
requirements  of ERISA  and of the Code and  with  all  applicable  rulings  and
regulations  issued under the  provisions  of ERISA and of the Code and will not
and not permit any of the ERISA  Affiliates to (a) engage in any  transaction in
connection  with  which the  Borrower  or any of the ERISA  Affiliates  would be
subject to either a civil penalty  assessed  pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA
or a tax  imposed  by  Section  4975 of the Code,  in  either  case in an amount
exceeding $50,000,  (b) fail to make full payment when due of all amounts which,
under the  provisions  of any Plan,  the  Borrower  or any  ERISA  Affiliate  is
required to pay as  contributions  thereto,  or permit to exist any  accumulated
funding  deficiency (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section
412 of the  Code),  whether  or not  waived,  with  respect  to any  Plan  in an
aggregate  amount  exceeding  $50,000  or (c)  fail to make any  payments  in an
aggregate amount exceeding $50,000 to any  Multiemployer  Plan that the Borrower
or any of the ERISA  Affiliates  may be  required  to make  under any  agreement
relating to such Multiemployer Plan or any law pertaining thereto.

Section  5.11  Fund  Agreements.   Subject  to  its  fiduciary
obligations  and except as may  otherwise be required by law, the Borrower  will
use its  best  efforts  to  cause  each  Fund  for  which a  Subsidiary  acts as
investment advisor or principal  distributor to continue such Subsidiary in such

and any and all claims of the Borrower or any Subsidiary against, the Bank. Such
right shall exist  whether or not the Bank shall have made any demand  hereunder
or under any other Loan Document,  whether or not the  Obligations,  or any part
thereof,  or deposits  and credits  held for the account of the  Borrower or any
Subsidiary  is or are matured or unmatured,  and  regardless of the existence or
adequacy  of any  collateral,  guaranty or any other  security,  right or remedy
available  to the Bank.  The Bank agrees  that,  as  promptly  as is  reasonably
possible  after the  exercise  of any such  setoff  right,  it shall  notify the
Borrower of its  exercise  of such setoff  right;  provided,  however,  that the
failure of the Bank to provide  such notice shall not affect the
<PAGE>
validity of the exercise of such setoff rights.  Nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed a waiver or prohibition of or restriction on the Bank to all rights of
banker's Lien, setoff and counterclaim available pursuant to law.

Section 8.1 Modifications.  Notwithstanding  any provisions to
the contrary herein,  any term of this Agreement may be amended with the written
consent of the Borrower;  provided that no amendment,  modification or waiver of
any  provision  of this  Agreement  or consent to any  departure by the Borrower
therefrom  shall in any event be  effective  unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Bank, and then such amendment, modification, waiver or consent
shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the purpose for which
given.

Section 8.2 Expenses;  Amendment or Waiver Fee. Whether or not
the transactions  contemplated  hereby are  consummated,  the Borrower agrees to
reimburse the Bank upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid or
incurred by the Bank (including filing and recording costs and fees and expenses
of  Dorsey  &  Whitney  LLP,  counsel  to  the  Bank)  in  connection  with  the
negotiation, preparation, approval, review, execution, delivery, administration,
amendment,  modification and interpretation of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and any commitment  letters relating thereto.  The Borrower shall also
reimburse  the  Bank  upon  demand  for all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses
(including expenses of legal counsel) paid or incurred by the Bank in connection
with the  collection  and  enforcement  of this  Agreement  and any  other  Loan
Document.  The  obligations of the Borrower under this Section shall survive any
termination  of this  Agreement.  In  addition,  the Company  shall pay a fee of
$1,500.00 to the Bank on the effective date of any amendment to, modification of
or waiver of any provision of this Agreement if the Bank determines, in its sole
discretion,  that its  policies  or  practices  required  the Bank to obtain the
approval of any credit committee or similar approval authority for the execution
of such amendment, modification or waiver.

Section 8.3  Waivers,  etc. No failure on the part of the Bank
or the  holder of a Note to  exercise  and no delay in  exercising  any power or
right  hereunder  or under any other  Loan  Document  shall  operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude
any other or further  exercise  thereof or the  exercise  of any other  power or
right.  The  remedies  herein  and in the  other  Loan  Documents  provided  are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

expressly authorized by this Agreement, any notice or other communication to any
party in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be sent by
manual
<PAGE>
delivery,  telegram, telex, facsimile transmission,  overnight courier or United
States mail (postage  prepaid)  addressed to such party at the address specified
on the signature page hereof,  or at such other address as such party shall have
specified to the other party  hereto in writing.  All periods of notice shall be

Section 8.5 Taxes.  The  Borrower  agrees to pay, and save the
Bank  harmless  from all  liability  for,  any stamp or other taxes which may be
payable  with  respect to the  execution  or delivery of this  Agreement  or the
issuance  of the Note,  which  obligation  of the  Borrower  shall  survive  the
termination of this Agreement.

Section 8.6  Successors  and  Assigns;  Disposition  of Loans;
Transferees.  This  Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,  except that the

under any other Borrower Loan Document  without the prior written consent of the
Bank. The Bank may at any time sell, assign,  transfer, grant participations in,
or otherwise dispose of any portion of the Commitment, the Loans and/or Advances

that each Transferee  shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.21,  2.22,

Transferee  may  exercise  any and all  rights  of  banker's  Lien,  setoff  and
counterclaim as if such Transferee were a direct lender to the Borrower.  If the
Bank makes any assignment to a Transferee, then upon notice to the Borrower such
Transferee,  to  the  extent  of  such  assignment  (unless  otherwise  provided
therein),  shall  become a "Bank"  hereunder  and shall  have all the rights and
obligations of the Bank hereunder and the Bank shall be released from its duties
and  obligations  under  this  Agreement  to  the  extent  of  such  assignment.
Notwithstanding  the sale by the  Bank of any  participation  hereunder,  (a) no
participant shall be deemed to be or have the rights and obligations of the Bank
hereunder except that any participant shall have a right of setoff under Section
7.3 as if it were  the Bank  and the  amount  of its  participation  were  owing
directly  to such  participant  by the  Borrower  and (b) the Bank  shall not in
connection  with selling any such  participation  condition the Bank's rights in
connection  with  consenting to amendments or granting  waivers  concerning  any
matter under any Loan  Document upon  obtaining the consent of such  participant
other  than on  matters  relating  to (i) any  reduction  in the  amount  of any
principal  of, or the amount of or rate of  interest  on, the Note or Advance in
which such  participation  is sold, (ii) any  postponement of the date fixed for
any  payment of  principal  of or  interest on the Note or Advance in which such
participation  is sold,  (iii) the  release  or  subordination  of any  material
<PAGE>
portion of any  collateral  other  than  pursuant  to the terms of any  Security

to the provisions hereof is used only for the purposes of this Agreement and any
other  relationship  between the Bank and the Borrower and shall not be divulged
to any Person other than the Bank, its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents, except: (a) to their attorneys and accountants,
(b) in connection  with the  enforcement of the rights of the Bank hereunder and
under the Note,  the  Guaranties  and the  Security  Documents  or  otherwise in
connection with applicable  litigation,  (c) in connection with  assignments and
participations  and the  solicitation of prospective  assignees and participants
referred to in the immediately  preceding  Section,  and (d) as may otherwise be
required or requested by any regulatory  authority having  jurisdiction over the
Bank or by any applicable law, rule, regulation or judicial process, the opinion
of the Bank's counsel  concerning the making of such disclosure to be binding on
the parties  hereto.  The Bank shall not incur any  liability to the Borrower by
reason of any disclosure permitted by this Section 8.7.

Section 8.8  Governing  Law and  Construction.  THE  VALIDITY,
CONSTRUCTION  AND  ENFORCEABILITY  OF THIS  AGREEMENT  AND THE  NOTES  SHALL  BE
GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA,  WITHOUT  GIVING EFFECT
TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THEREOF, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS OF THE
UNITED STATES APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other statement,  instrument
or  transaction  contemplated  hereby or thereby or  relating  hereto or thereto
shall be  interpreted  in such  manner as to be  effective  and valid under such
applicable  law,  but,  if any  provision  of this  Agreement,  the  other  Loan
Documents or any other statement,  instrument or transaction contemplated hereby
or  thereby or  relating  hereto or thereto  shall be held to be  prohibited  or
invalid under such applicable  law, such provision shall be ineffective  only to
the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement,  the other Loan
Documents or any other statement,  instrument or transaction contemplated hereby
or thereby or relating hereto or thereto.

BANK, THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY FEDERAL
COURT OR MINNESOTA STATE COURT SITTING IN HENNEPIN  COUNTY,  MINNESOTA;  AND THE
BORROWER CONSENTS TO THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF ANY SUCH COURT AND WAIVES ANY
<PAGE>
ARGUMENT THAT VENUE IN SUCH FORUMS IS NOT CONVENIENT.  IN THE EVENT THE BORROWER
COMMENCES ANY ACTION IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION OR VENUE UNDER ANY TORT OR CONTRACT
THEORY  ARISING  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  FROM THE  RELATIONSHIP  CREATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, THE BANK AT ITS OPTION SHALL BE ENTITLED TO HAVE THE CASE TRANSFERRED
TO ONE OF THE  JURISDICTIONS  AND VENUES  ABOVE-DESCRIBED,  OR IF SUCH  TRANSFER
CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, TO HAVE SUCH CASE DISMISSED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.

Section  8.10 Waiver of Jury Trial.  EACH OF THE  BORROWER AND
THE BANK  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES  ANY AND ALL  RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY  LEGAL
PROCEEDING  ARISING  OUT OF OR  RELATING  TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR ANY OTHER  LOAN
DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

warranties,  covenants and agreement made by the Borrower herein or in the other
Loan  Documents  and  in the  certificates  or  other  instruments  prepared  or
delivered  in  connection  with or pursuant to this  Agreement or any other Loan
Document  shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the Bank and shall survive
the making of the Loans by the Bank and the  execution  and delivery to the Bank
by the  Borrower  of the Note,  regardless  of any  investigation  made by or on
behalf of the Bank,  and shall  continue in full force and effect as long as any
Obligation is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitment have not been
terminated;  provided,  however,  that the  obligations  of the  Borrower  under
Sections 8.2, 8.5 and 8.12 shall survive  payment in full of the Obligations and
the termination of the Commitment.

defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Bank and its Affiliates and the
directors,  officers,  employees,  attorneys  and  agents  of the  Bank  and its

actions,  damages,  liabilities,  judgments,  costs and expenses  (including all

against any Indemnitee,  whether direct,  indirect or consequential  and whether
based on any federal,  state,  local or foreign laws or  regulations  (including
securities laws,  environmental  laws,  commercial laws and regulations),  under
common law or on equitable cause, or on contract or otherwise:

way of foreclosure of the Lien thereon, deed or bill of sale in lieu of
such foreclosure or otherwise;

provided,  however,  that the Borrower shall not be liable to any Indemnitee for
any portion of such claims,  damages,  liabilities  and expenses  resulting from
such  Indemnitee's  gross  negligence or willful  misconduct.  In the event this
indemnity  is  unenforceable  as a matter  of law as to a  particular  matter or
consequence  referred  to herein,  it shall be  enforceable  to the full  extent
permitted by law.

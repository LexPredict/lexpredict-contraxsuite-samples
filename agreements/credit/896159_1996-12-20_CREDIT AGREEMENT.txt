number of days as the Borrower and the Agent may agree) of any other Money
Market Quote Request.

(c)  Invitation for Money Market Quotes.  Promptly upon receipt of a
Money Market Quote Request, the Agent shall send to the Banks by telex or

Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower.

(ii)  Each Money Market Quote shall be in substantially the form of
Exhibit D hereto and shall in any case specify:

(A)  the proposed date of Borrowing,

(B)  the principal amount of the Money Market Loan for which each such
offer is being made, which principal amount (w) may be greater than or less
than the Commitment of the quoting Bank, (x) must be $5,000,000 or a larger

(D)  in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction, the rate of interest per

15
<PAGE>

1/10,000th of 1%) (the "Money Market Absolute Rate") offered for each such
Money Market Loan, and

(E)  the identity of the quoting Bank.

A Money Market Quote may set forth up to five separate offers by the quoting
Bank with respect to each Interest Period specified in the related Invitation
for Money Market Quotes.

(iii)  Any Money Market Quote shall be disregarded if it:

(A)  is not substantially in conformity with Exhibit D hereto or does
not specify all of the information required by subsection (d)(ii);

(B)  contains qualifying, conditional or similar language;

(C)  proposes terms other than or in addition to those set forth in
the applicable Invitation for Money Market Quotes; or

(D)  arrives after the time set forth in subsection (d)(i).

(e)  Notice to Borrower.  The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
of the terms (x) of any Money Market Quote submitted by a Bank that is in
accordance with subsection (d) and (y) of any Money Market Quote that amends,
modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Money Market Quote
submitted by such Bank with respect to the same Money Market Quote Request.  Any
such subsequent Money Market Quote shall be disregarded by the Agent unless such
subsequent Money Market Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in
such former Money Market Quote.  The Agent's notice to the Borrower shall
specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of Money Market Loans for which
offers have been received for each Interest Period specified in the related
Money Market Quote Request, (B) the respective principal amounts and Money
Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be, so offered
and (C) if applicable, limitations on the aggregate principal amount of Money

(f)  Acceptance and Notice by Borrower.  Not later than 10:30 A.M.
(New York City time) on (x) the third Euro-Dollar Business Day prior to the
proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of a LIBOR Auction or (y) the

16
<PAGE>

proposed date of Borrowing, in the case of an Absolute Rate Auction (or, in
either case, such other time or date as the Borrower and the Agent shall have
mutually agreed and shall have notified to the Banks not later than the date of
the Money Market Quote Request for the first LIBOR Auction or Absolute Rate
Auction for which such change is to be effective), the Borrower shall notify the
Agent of its acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it
pursuant to subsection (e). In the case of acceptance, such notice (such notice
to be signed by any two of the President or Executive Vice-President(s) or any
one of the President or Executive Vice-President(s) together with any one of the
Senior Vice-President(s) signing jointly and hereinafter referred to as a
"Notice of Money Market Borrowing") shall specify the aggregate principal amount
of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept
any Money Market Quote in whole or in part; provided that:

(i)  the aggregate principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing may
not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Money Market
Quote Request,

(ii)  the principal amount of each Money Market Borrowing must be
$5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000,

(iii)  acceptance of offers may only be made on the basis of ascending
Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may be,
and

(iv)  the Borrower may not accept any offer that is described in
subsection (d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the requirements
of this Agreement.

(g) Allocation by Agent. If offers are made by two or more Banks with
the same Money Market Margins or Money Market Absolute Rates, as the case may
be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which
such offers are accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal amount
of Money Market Loans in respect of which such offers are accepted shall be
allocated by the Agent among such Banks as nearly as possible (in multiples of
$1,000,000, as the Agent may deem appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate
principal amounts of such offers. Determinations by the Agent of the amounts of
Money Market Loans shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

SECTION 2.04.  Notice to Banks; Funding of Loans.

17
<PAGE>

(a)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly
notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such Bank's share (if any) of
such Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by
the Borrower.

(b)  Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of
each Borrowing, each Bank participating therein shall (except as provided in
subsection (c) of this Section) make available its share of such Borrowing, in
Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the Agent at
its address referred to in Section 10.01.  Unless the Agent determines that any
applicable condition specified in Article III has not been satisfied, the Agent
will make the funds so received from the Banks available to the Borrower at the
Agent's aforesaid address.

(c)  If any Bank makes a new Loan hereunder on a day on which the
Borrower is to repay all or any part of an outstanding Loan from such Bank, such
Bank shall apply the proceeds of its new Loan to make such repayment and only an
amount equal to the difference (if any) between the amount being borrowed and
the amount being repaid shall be made available by such Bank to the Agent as
provided in subsection (b), or remitted by the Borrower to the Agent as provided
in Section 2.12, as the case may be.

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to
the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent
such Bank's share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has
made such share available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2.04 and the Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made
such share available to the Agent, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to
repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to
the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the
case of the Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable
thereto pursuant to Section 2.07 and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal
Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount,
such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Loan included in such
Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

SECTION 2.05.  Notes.  (a)  The Loans of each Bank shall be evidenced
by a single Note payable to the order of

18
<PAGE>

such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office in an amount equal to
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Bank's Loans.

(b)  Each Bank may, by notice to the Borrower and the Agent, request
that its Loans of a particular type be evidenced by a separate Note in an amount
equal to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans.  Each such Note
shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto with appropriate
modifications to reflect the fact that it evidences solely Loans of the relevant
type.  Each reference in this Agreement to the "Note" of such Bank shall be
deemed to refer to and include any or all of such Notes, as the context may
require.

(c)  Upon receipt of each Bank's Note pursuant to Section 3.01(a), the
Agent shall forward such Note to such Bank.  Each Bank shall record the date,
amount, type and maturity of each Loan made by it and the date and amount of
each payment of principal made by the Borrower with respect thereto, and may, if
such Bank so elects in connection with any transfer or enforcement of its Note,
endorse on the schedule forming a part thereof appropriate notations to evidence
the foregoing information with respect to each such Loan then outstanding;
provided that the failure of any Bank to make any such recordation or
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or under
the Notes.  Each Bank is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to
endorse its Note and to attach to and make a part of its Note a continuation of
any such schedule as and when required.

SECTION 2.06.  Maturity of Loans.  Each Loan included in any Borrowing
shall mature, and the principal amount thereof shall be due and payable, on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing.

SECTION 2.07. Interest Rates. (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date
such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate for such day. Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on
the last day thereof. Any overdue principal of or interest on any Base Rate Loan
shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per
annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate
Loans for such day.

(b)  Each CD Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a
rate per annum

19
<PAGE>

equal to the sum of the CD Margin plus the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to such
Interest Period; provided that if any CD Loan or any portion thereof shall, as a
result of clause (2)(b) of the definition of Interest Period, have an Interest
Period of less than 30 days, such portion shall bear interest during such
Interest Period at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans during such period.
Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof
and, if such Interest Period is longer than 90 days, at intervals of 90 days
after the first day thereof. Any overdue principal of or interest on any CD Loan
shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per
annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the higher of (i) the sum of the CD Margin
plus the Adjusted CD Rate applicable to the Interest Period for such Loan and
(ii) the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day.

"CD Margin" means 0.400% per annum.

The "Adjusted CD Rate" applicable to any Interest Period means a rate
per annum determined pursuant to the following formula:


[ CDBR       ]*
ACDR  =  [ ---------- ]  + AR
[ 1.00 - DRP ]

ACDR  =  Adjusted CD Rate
CDBR  =  CD Base Rate
DRP  =  Domestic Reserve Percentage
AR  =  Assessment Rate

*  The amount in brackets being rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%


The "CD Base Rate" applicable to any Interest Period is the rate of
interest determined by the Agent to be the average (rounded upward, if
necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) of the prevailing rates per annum bid
at 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) (or as soon thereafter as practicable) on the
first day of such Interest Period by two or more New York certificate of deposit
dealers of recognized standing for the purchase at face value from each CD
Reference Bank of its certificates of deposit in an amount comparable to the
principal amount of the CD Loan of such CD Reference Bank to which such Interest
Period applies and having a maturity comparable to such Interest Period.

20
<PAGE>

"Domestic Reserve Percentage" means for any day that percentage
(expressed as a decimal) which is in effect on such day, as prescribed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) for
determining the maximum reserve requirement (including without limitation any
basic, supplemental or emergency reserves) for a member bank of the Federal
Reserve System in New York City with deposits exceeding five billion dollars in
respect of new non-personal time deposits in dollars in New York City having a
maturity comparable to the related Interest Period and in an amount of $100,000
or more.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
effective date of any change in the Domestic Reserve Percentage.

"Assessment Rate" means for any day the annual assessment rate in
effect on such day which is payable by a member of the Bank Insurance Fund
classified as adequately capitalized and within supervisory subgroup "A" (or a
comparable successor assessment risk classification) within the meaning of 12
C.F.R. (S) 327.4(a) (or any successor provision) to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (or any successor) for such Corporation's (or such
successor's) insuring time deposits at offices of such institution in the United
States.  The Adjusted CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the
effective date of any change in the Assessment Rate.

(c)  Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof, for each day during the Interest Period applicable
thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such
day plus the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Interest Period.
Such interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof
and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three
months after the first day thereof.

"Euro-Dollar Margin" means 0.285% per annum.

The "London Interbank Offered Rate" applicable to any Interest Period
means the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16 of 1%)
of the respective rates per annum at which deposits in dollars are offered to
each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks in the London interbank market at
approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two Euro-Dollar Business Days before the
first day of such Interest Period in an amount approximately equal to the
principal amount of the Euro-Dollar Loan of such Euro-Dollar Reference Bank to
which such Interest Period is to apply and for a period of time comparable to
such Interest Period.

21
<PAGE>

(d)  Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan
shall bear interest, payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per
annum equal to the higher of (i) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar Margin plus
the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to the Interest Period for such
Loan and (ii) the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar Margin plus the quotient
obtained (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) by
dividing (x) the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/16
of 1%) of the respective rates per annum at which one day (or, if such amount
due remains unpaid more than three Euro-Dollar Business Days, then for such
other period of time not longer than six months as the Agent may select)
deposits in dollars in an amount approximately equal to such overdue payment due
to each of the Euro-Dollar Reference Banks are offered to such Euro-Dollar
Reference Bank in the London interbank market for the applicable period
determined as provided above by (y) 1.00 minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage (or, if the circumstances described in clause (a) or (b) of Section
8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans for such day).

(e)  Subject to Section 8.01(a), each Money Market LIBOR Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for the Interest
Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the London
Interbank Offered Rate for such Interest Period (determined in accordance with
Section 2.07(c) as if the related Money Market LIBOR Borrowing were a Committed
Euro-Dollar Borrowing) plus (or minus) the Money Market Margin quoted by the
Bank making such Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.  Each Money Market
Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof, for the Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate per annum equal
to the Money Market Absolute Rate quoted by the Bank making such Loan in
accordance with Section 2.03.  Such interest shall be payable for each Interest
Period on the last day thereof and, if such Interest Period is longer than three
months, at intervals of three months after the first day thereof.  Any overdue
principal of or interest on any Money Market Loan shall bear interest, payable
on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2%
plus the Base Rate for such day.

(f)  The Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the
Loans hereunder.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and the
participating Banks of each rate of interest so determined, and its
determination

22
<PAGE>

thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(g)  Each Reference Bank agrees to use its best efforts to furnish
quotations to the Agent as contemplated by this Section.  If any Reference Bank
does not furnish a timely quotation, the Agent shall determine the relevant
interest rate on the basis of the quotation or quotations furnished by the
remaining Reference Bank or Banks or, if none of such quotations is available on
a timely basis, the provisions of Section 8.01 shall apply.

SECTION 2.08.  Facility Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for
the account of the Banks ratably a facility fee at the rate of 0.090% per annum.
Such facility fee shall accrue (i) from and including the Closing Date to but
excluding the Termination Date (or earlier date of termination of the
Commitments in their entirety), on the daily aggregate amount of the Commitments
(whether used or unused) and (ii) from and including the Termination Date or
such earlier date of termination to but excluding the date the Loans shall be
repaid in their entirety, on the daily aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the Loans.  Accrued fees under this Section shall be payable quarterly in
arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 and upon the
date of termination of the Commitments in their entirety (and, if later, the
date the Loans shall be repaid in their entirety).

SECTION 2.09.  Optional Termination or Reduction of Commitments.  The
Borrower may, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent,
(i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are outstanding at such
time or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time by an aggregate amount of
$25,000,000 or any larger multiple of $5,000,000, the aggregate amount of the
Commitments in excess of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
Loans.  Upon receipt of any notice pursuant to this Section 2.09, the Agent
shall promptly notify the Banks of the contents of such notice.

SECTION 2.10.  Scheduled Termination of Commitments.  The Commitments
shall terminate on the Termination Date, and any Loans then outstanding
(together with accrued interest thereon) shall be due and payable on such date.

SECTION 2.11.  Optional Prepayments.  (a)  Subject in the case of any
Fixed Rate Borrowing to Section 2.13, the Borrower may, in the case of any CD
Borrowing, upon at least three Domestic Business Days' notice to the Agent,
prepay

23
<PAGE>

such CD Borrowing, or, in the case of any other Domestic Borrowing (or
any Money Market Borrowing bearing interest at the Base Rate pursuant to Section
8.01(a)), upon at least one Domestic Business Day's notice to the Agent, prepay
such other Domestic Borrowing, or in the case of any Euro-Dollar Borrowing, upon
at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days' notice to the Agent, prepay any Euro-
Dollar Borrowing, in each case in whole at any time, or from time to time in
part in amounts aggregating $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000, by
paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with accrued interest thereon
to the date of prepayment.  Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to
prepay ratably the Loans of the several Banks included in such Borrowing.

(b)  Except as provided in Section 2.11(a), the Borrower may not
prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of any Money Market Loan prior
to the maturity thereof.

(c)  Upon receipt of a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section,
the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the contents thereof and of such
Bank's ratable share (if any) of such prepayment and such notice shall not
thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.

SECTION 2.12.  General Provisions as to Payments.  (a)  The Borrower
shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees
hereunder, not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date when due,
in Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City and in the
lawful currency of the United States, to the Agent at its address referred to in
Section 10.01.  The Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its ratable
share of each such payment received by the Agent for the account of the Banks.
Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Domestic Loans or of
fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for
payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day.
Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans
shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for
payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business
Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month, in
which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar
Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Money
Market Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the
date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar
Business Day.  If the date for any payment of

24
<PAGE>

principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall
be payable for such extended time.

(b)  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the
extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall
repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

SECTION 2.13.  Funding Losses.  If the Borrower makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan (pursuant to Article II, VI or
VIII or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, or the last day of an applicable period fixed pursuant to
Section 2.07(d), or if the Borrower fails to borrow or prepay any Fixed Rate
Loans after notice has been given to any Bank in accordance with Section 2.04(a)
or 2.11(c), the Borrower shall reimburse each Bank within 15 days after demand
for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an existing or, in the
case of the failure of the Borrower to borrow any Fixed Rate Loans, prospective
Participant in the related Loan), including (without limitation) any loss
incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits from third parties, but
excluding loss of margin for the period after any such payment or failure to
borrow or prepay, provided that such Bank shall have delivered to the Borrower a
certificate as to the amount of such loss or expense and setting forth the
calculation thereof, which certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error.

SECTION 2.14. Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the

SECTION 2.15.  Regulation D Compensation.  For so long as any Bank
maintains reserves against "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or any other category of
liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on
Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other
assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of such Bank to United
States residents), and as a result the cost to such Bank (or its Euro-Dollar
Lending Office) of making or maintaining its Euro-Dollar Loans is increased,
then such Bank may require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each
payment of interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans, additional interest on the related
Euro-Dollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum up to but not exceeding the
excess of (i) (A) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate divided by (B)
one minus the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate. Any Bank wishing to require payment of such additional
interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Agent, in which case such
additional interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans of such Bank shall be payable to
such Bank at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest
Period commencing at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days after the giving of
such notice and (y) shall furnish to the Borrower at least five Euro-Dollar
Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Dollar
Loans an officer's certificate setting forth the amount to which such Bank is
then entitled under this Section (which shall be consistent with such Bank's
good faith estimate of the level at which the related reserves are maintained by
it). Each such certificate shall be accompanied by such information as the

period of 12 consecutive calendar months, individuals who were directors of
the Borrower on the first day of such

40
<PAGE>

period shall cease to constitute a majority of the board of directors of
the Borrower; or either Guarantor shall cease to be a Wholly-Owned
Consolidated Subsidiary of the Borrower;

(j)  any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or
official which has jurisdiction in the matter shall decide, rule or order
that any provision of any of the Financing Documents is invalid or
unenforceable in any material respect, or any Obligor shall so assert in
writing; or

(k)  the registration of either Guarantor as an insurer shall be
revoked, suspended or otherwise have restrictions or conditions placed upon
it unless, in the case of the placing of any such restrictions or
conditions, such restrictions or conditions could not have a material
adverse effect on the interests of the Agent and the Banks under the
Financing Documents;

then, and in every such event, the Agent shall (i) if requested by Banks having
more than 50% in aggregate amount of the Commitments, by notice to the Borrower
terminate the Commitments and they shall thereupon terminate, and (ii) if
requested by Banks holding Notes evidencing more than 50% in aggregate principal
amount of the Loans, by notice to the Borrower declare the Notes (together with
accrued interest thereon) to be, and the Notes (together with accrued interest
thereon) shall thereupon become, immediately due and payable without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby waived by the Obligors; provided that in the case of any of the Events of
Default specified in clause (g) above with respect to any Obligor, without any
notice to any Obligor or any other act by the Agent or the Banks, the
Commitments shall thereupon terminate and the Notes (together with accrued
interest thereon) shall become immediately due and payable without presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by
the Obligors.

SECTION 6.02.  Notice of Default.  The Agent shall give notice to the
Borrower under Section 6.01(c) promptly upon being requested to do so by any
Bank and shall thereupon notify all the Banks thereof.

THE AGENT


SECTION 7.01.  Appointment and Authorization.  Each Bank irrevocably
appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and
to exercise such powers under the Financing Documents as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with all such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.

SECTION 7.02.  Agent and Affiliates.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
New York shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other
Bank and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not
the Agent, and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York and its affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate of the Borrower as if
it were not the Agent hereunder.

SECTION 7.03.  Action by Agent.  The obligations of the Agent under
this Agreement are only those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Agent shall not be required to take any action
with respect to any Default, except as expressly provided in Article VI.

SECTION 7.04.  Consultation with Experts.  The Agent may consult with
legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.

SECTION 7.05.  Liability of Agent.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection herewith
(i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks or (ii) in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Neither the Agent
nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain,
inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
connection with the Financing Documents or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any Obligor;
(iii) the satisfaction of any
42
<PAGE>

condition specified in Article III, except receipt of items required to be
delivered to the Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of
any Financing Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in
connection herewith. The Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in
reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other writing
(which may be a bank wire, telex, facsimile transmission or similar writing)
believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties.

SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  Each Bank shall, ratably in
accordance with its Commitment, indemnify the Agent, its affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including counsel fees
and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as
result from such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct) that such
indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with the Financing Documents or
any action taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder or thereunder.

SECTION 7.07.  Credit Decision.  Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank, and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking any action under this Agreement.

SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign at any time by
giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation,
the Required Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent, which
successor Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks, and shall have
accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice
of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a
successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized or licensed under
the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the

43
<PAGE>

rights and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's
resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent.

SECTION 7.09.  Agent's Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for
its own account fees in the amounts and at the times previously agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Agent.


ARTICLE VIII

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES


SECTION 8.01.  Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or
Unfair. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Fixed
Rate Borrowing:

(a)  the Agent is advised by the Reference Banks that deposits in
dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to the Reference
Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or

(b)  in the case of a Committed Borrowing, Banks having 50% or more of
the aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the Agent that the Adjusted
CD Rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate, as the case may be, as
determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Banks of funding their CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may
be, for such Interest Period,

the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Banks,
whereupon until the Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Banks to make CD
Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended. Unless the
Borrower notifies the Agent at least two Domestic Business Days before the date
of any Fixed Rate Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has previously been
given that it elects not to borrow on such date, (i) if such Fixed Rate
Borrowing is a Committed Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be made as a
Base Rate Borrowing and (ii) if such Fixed Rate Borrowing is a Money Market
LIBOR Borrowing, the Money Market LIBOR Loans comprising such Borrowing shall
bear interest for each day from and including the first day to but excluding the
last

44
<PAGE>

day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the Base Rate for such day.

SECTION 8.02.  Illegality.  If, on or after the date of this
Agreement, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change
in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any
Bank (or its Euro-Dollar Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-
Dollar Loans and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall forthwith
give notice thereof to the other Banks and the Borrower, whereupon until such
Bank notifies the Borrower and the Agent that the circumstances giving rise to
such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Bank to make Euro-Dollar
Loans shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this
Section, such Bank shall designate a different Euro-Dollar Lending Office if
such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the
judgment of such Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. If such Bank
shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund any of
its outstanding Euro-Dollar Loans to maturity and shall so specify in such
notice, the Borrower shall immediately prepay in full the then outstanding
principal amount of each such Euro-Dollar Loan, together with accrued interest
thereon. Concurrently with prepaying each such Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower
shall borrow a Base Rate Loan in an equal principal amount from such Bank (on
which interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously with the related
Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Banks), and such Bank shall make such a Base Rate
Loan.

SECTION 8.03.  Increased Cost and Reduced Return.  (a)  If on or after
(x) the date hereof, in the case of any Committed Loan or any obligation to make
Committed Loans or (y) the date of the related Money Market Quote, in the case
of any Money Market Loan, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any

45
<PAGE>

such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall impose, modify or deem
applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any such requirement
imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding
(i) with respect to any CD Loan any such requirement included in an applicable
Domestic Reserve Percentage and (ii) with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any
such requirement included in an applicable Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage),
special deposit, insurance assessment (excluding, with respect to any CD Loan,
any such requirement reflected in an applicable Assessment Rate) or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, any Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or shall impose on any
Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the United States market for
certificates of deposit or the London interbank market any other condition
affecting its Fixed Rate Loans, its Note or its obligation to make Fixed Rate
Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Bank (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Fixed Rate
Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank (or
its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its Note with
respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then, within
15 days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall
pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank
for such increased cost or reduction.

(b)  If any Bank shall have determined that, after the date hereof,
the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital
adequacy, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence of such Bank's
obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Bank (or its Parent)
could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive (taking
into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within 15 days after
demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such
Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank (or its
Parent) for such reduction.

46
<PAGE>

(c)  Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any
event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will
entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section and will designate a
different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for,
or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such
Bank, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank. A certificate of any Bank
claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount
or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. In determining such amount, such Bank may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

SECTION 8.04.  Taxes.  (a)  Any and all payments by any Obligor
hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings,
and all penalties, interest, expenses and similar liabilities with respect
thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Bank and the Agent, taxes imposed on
its income, and franchise and similar taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction
under the laws of which such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, shall be
organized or any political subdivision thereof, (ii) in the case of each Bank,
taxes imposed on its income, and franchise and similar taxes imposed on it, by
the jurisdiction of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof or in which such Bank's principal executive office is
located or any political subdivision thereof and (iii) any Taxes imposed as a
result of a change of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office to the extent such
Taxes would not have been imposed absent such change; provided however, that (x)
a change in such Bank's Applicable Lending Office to which the Obligor has
consented and (y) a change in such Bank's Applicable Lending Office as a result
of legal or regulatory restrictions shall not constitute a change for the
purposes of this Section 8.04 (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). Each Obligor agrees that, if any Obligor shall be required by law
to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Bank
or the Agent, (A) the sum payable to such Bank or the Agent shall be increased
as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions for Taxes
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
8.04), such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, shall receive an amount equal
to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (B) such
Obligor shall make such deductions and (C) such Obligor shall pay the full


47
<PAGE>

amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law.

(b)  In addition, each Obligor agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which shall arise from any payment made under, or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement (all such taxes, charges or levies being hereinafter referred to as
"Other Taxes").

(c) Each Obligor agrees to indemnify each Bank and the Agent for the
full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed
on amounts payable under this Section 8.04) paid by such Bank or the Agent or
any penalties, interest, expenses and similar liabilities arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted provided that such Bank has acted in good faith with respect to
such Taxes or Other Taxes and that such Bank reasonably cooperates with the
Obligors in challenging such Taxes or Other Taxes.  Each indemnification under
this paragraph (c) shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank or the
Agent makes demand therefor.

(d)  Each Bank shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and
regulatory restrictions) (x) to file any certificate or document or to furnish
any information as reasonably requested by any Obligor pursuant to any
applicable treaty, law, rule or regulation or (y) to designate a different
Lending Office if the making of such a filing, the furnishing of such
information or the designation of such other Lending Office would avoid the need
for or reduce the amount of any additional amounts payable by any Obligor
pursuant to this Section 8.04 and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that nothing in this Section 8.04 shall interfere with the
rights of any Bank to conduct its fiscal or tax affairs in such manner as it
deems fit.

(e)  Within 90 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the
Obligors will furnish to the Agent notarized copies for each Bank of the
original receipt evidencing payment thereof.  If no Taxes shall be payable in
respect of any payment under this Agreement, the Obligors will, upon the
reasonable request of the Agent, furnish to the Agent a certificate in form
reasonably acceptable to the Agent's counsel confirming that such payment is
exempt from or not subject to Taxes.

48
<PAGE>

(f)  For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to provide
the Obligors with the appropriate form pursuant to Section 8.04(d) (unless such
failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation occurring subsequent to
the date on which such form originally was required to be provided), such Bank
shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.04(a) or (b) with
respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that if a Bank, which is
otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax, becomes
subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder,
the Obligors shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably request to
assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.

SECTION 8.05.  Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Fixed Rate
Loans.  If (i) the obligation of any Bank to make Euro-Dollar Loans has been
suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any Bank has demanded compensation
under Section 8.03 or 8.04 with respect to its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans and
the Borrower shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days' prior notice to
such Bank through the Agent, have elected that the provisions of this Section
shall apply to such Bank, then, unless and until such Bank notifies the Borrower
that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for compensation
no longer exist:

(a)  all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Bank as CD Loans
or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may be, shall be made instead as Base
Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Fixed Rate Loans of the other Banks),
and

(b)  after each of its CD Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans, as the case may
be, has been repaid, all payments of principal which would otherwise be
applied to repay such Fixed Rate Loans shall be applied to repay its Base
Rate Loans instead.


ARTICLE IX

GUARANTY

SECTION 9.01.  The Guaranty.  Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally,
absolutely and irrevocably guarantees the full and punctual payment (whether at
stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) of all amounts payable by the
Borrower under the Financing Documents including, without limitation, the
principal of and interest on each Note issued by the Borrower pursuant to this

49
<PAGE>

Agreement.  Upon failure by the Borrower to pay punctually any such amount, each
Guarantor shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and
in the manner specified in this Agreement.

SECTION 9.02.  Guaranty Unconditional.  The obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional, absolute and irrevocable and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released,
discharged or otherwise affected by:

(i)  any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release
in respect of any obligation of any other Obligor under any of the
Financing Documents, by operation of law or otherwise;

(ii)  any modification or amendment of or supplement to any of the
Financing Documents;

(iii)  any release, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or
indirect security for any obligation of any other Obligor under any of the
Financing Documents;

(iv)  any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of
any Obligor, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting any other Obligor or its assets or any resulting
release or discharge of any obligation of any other Obligor contained in
any of the Financing Documents;

(v)  the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which any
Obligor may have at any time against any other Obligor, the Agent, any Bank
or any other corporation or person, whether in connection with any of the
Financing Documents or any unrelated transactions, provided that nothing
herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or
compulsory counterclaim;

(vi)  any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any
other Obligor for any reason of any of the Financing Documents, or any
provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the
payment by any other Obligor of the principal of or interest on any Note or
any other amount payable under any of the Financing Documents; or

(vii)  any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any
Obligor, the Agent, any Bank or any other corporation or person or any
other circumstance

50
<PAGE>

whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph,
constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to  either
Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

SECTION 9.03.  Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full; Reinstatement In
Certain Circumstances.  Each Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall remain in
full force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated and the
principal of and interest on the Notes and all other amounts payable by the
Borrower under the Financing Documents shall have been paid in full.  If at any
time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Note or any other amount
payable by the Borrower under the Financing Documents is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
of the Borrower or otherwise, each Guarantor's obligations hereunder with
respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due
but not made at such time.

SECTION 9.04.  Waiver by each of the Guarantors.  Each Guarantor
irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any
notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any
action be taken by any corporation or person against any other Obligor or any
other corporation or person.

SECTION 9.05.  Subrogation.  Each Guarantor irrevocably waives any and
all rights to which it may be entitled, by operation of law or otherwise, upon
making any payment hereunder to be subrogated to the rights of the payee against
the Borrower with respect to such payment or otherwise to be reimbursed,
indemnified or exonerated by the Borrower in respect thereof.

SECTION 9.06.  Stay of Acceleration.  If acceleration of the time for
payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under any of the Financing
Documents is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of
this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor hereunder
forthwith on demand by the Agent made at the request of the requisite proportion
of the Banks specified in Article VI.

SECTION 9.07.  Limit of Liability.  The obligations of each Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount
that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

MISCELLANEOUS


SECTION 10.01.  Notices.  All notices, requests and other
communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including bank wire,
telex, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such
party:  (x) in the case of any Obligor or the Agent, at its address, facsimile
number or telex number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (y) in the case
of any Bank, at its address, facsimile number or telex number set forth in its
Administrative Questionnaire or (z) in the case of any party, such other
address, facsimile number or telex number as such party may hereafter specify
for the purpose by notice to the Agent and the Borrower.  Each such notice,
request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by telex, when
such telex is transmitted to the telex number specified in this Section and the
appropriate answerback is received, (ii) if given by facsimile transmission,
when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and
confirmation of receipt is received, (iii) if given by mail, 10 days after such
communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid,
addressed as aforesaid or (iv) if given by any other means, when delivered at
the address specified in this Section; provided that notices to the Agent under
Article II or Article VIII shall not be effective until received.

SECTION 10.02.  No Waivers.  No failure or delay by the Agent or any
Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege under any Financing Document
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies provided in the
Financing Documents shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

SECTION 10.03.  Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Borrower shall pay
(i) all out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent, including fees and disbursements of
special counsel for the Agent, reasonably incurred in connection with the
preparation of the Financing Documents, any waiver or consent hereunder or
thereunder or any amendment hereof or thereof or any Default or alleged Default
hereunder or thereunder and (ii) if an Event of Default occurs, all out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Agent and each Bank, including (without
duplication) the fees and disbursements

52
<PAGE>

of outside counsel and the allocated cost of inside counsel, in connection with
such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency and other
enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.

(b)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Bank, their
respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and
employees of the foregoing (each an "Indemnitee") and hold each Indemnitee
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses of any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel, which may be reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding
(whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or
threatened relating to or arising out of the Financing Documents or any actual
or proposed use of proceeds of Loans; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the
right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 10.04.  Sharing of Set-Offs.  Each Bank agrees that if it
shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, receive
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal and interest due
with respect to any Note held by it which is greater than the proportion
received by any other Bank in respect of the aggregate amount of principal and
interest due with respect to any Note held by such other Bank, the Bank
receiving such proportionately greater payment shall purchase such
participations in the Notes held by the other Banks, and such other adjustments
shall be made, as may be required so that all such payments of principal and
interest with respect to the Notes held by the Banks shall be shared by the
Banks pro rata; provided that nothing in this Section shall impair the right of
any Bank to exercise any right of set-off or counterclaim it may have and to
apply the amount subject to such exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the
Borrower other than its indebtedness hereunder. Each Obligor agrees, to the
fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any holder of
a participation in a Note, whether or not acquired pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim and other rights
with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder of a participation
were a direct creditor of such Obligor in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 10.05.  Amendments and Waivers.  Any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes may be amended or

53
<PAGE>

waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by
the Obligors and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Agent
are affected thereby, by the Agent); provided that no such amendment or waiver
shall, unless signed by all the Banks, (i) increase or decrease the Commitment
of any Bank (except for a ratable decrease in the Commitments of all Banks) or
subject any Bank to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce the principal of or
rate of interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date
fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees
hereunder or for any reduction or termination of any Commitment, (iv) release
the Guarantors hereunder or (v) change the percentage of the Commitments or of
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Banks,
which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take any action under
this Section or any other provision of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.06.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Obligors may not
assign or otherwise transfer any of their rights under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of all Banks.

(b)  Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more banks or other
institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Commitment or
any or all of its Loans. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a
participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the
Borrower and the Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance
of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank
may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall
retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder including, without limitation, the right to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to
any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in clause (i),
(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 10.05 without the consent of the
Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall, to the extent
provided in its participation agreement and subject to subsection (e) below, be
entitled to the benefits of Article VIII with respect to its participating
interest. An assignment or other transfer which is not permitted by subsection
(c) or (d) below shall be given effect for

54
<PAGE>

purposes of this Agreement only to the extent of a participating interest
granted in accordance with this subsection (b).

(c)  Any Bank may at any time assign to one or more banks or other
institutions (each an "Assignee") all, or a proportionate part (equivalent to an
initial Commitment of not less than $5,000,000, unless the Borrower shall
otherwise consent or the assignment is for all of the rights and obligations of
the transferor Bank) of all, of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
and the Notes, and such Assignee shall assume such rights and obligations,
pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit I hereto executed by such Assignee and such transferor Bank, with (and
subject to) the subscribed consent of the Borrower, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and the Agent; provided that if an Assignee is an
affiliate of such transferor Bank or was a Bank immediately prior to such
assignment, no such consent shall be required; and provided further that such
assignment may, but need not, include rights of the transferor Bank in respect
of outstanding Money Market Loans; and provided further that, unless the
Borrower shall otherwise consent or the assignment is for all of the rights and
obligations of the transferor Bank, the Commitment of such transferor Bank after
giving effect to such assignment (together with the Commitments of its
affiliates) shall not be less than $5,000,000. Upon execution and delivery of
such instrument and payment by such Assignee to such transferor Bank of an
amount equal to the purchase price agreed between such transferor Bank and such
Assignee, such Assignee shall be a Bank party to this Agreement and shall have
all the rights and obligations of a Bank with a Commitment as set forth in such
instrument of assumption, and the transferor Bank shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent, and no further consent or
action by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of any assignment
pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Bank, the Agent and the Borrower
shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new Note is issued
to the Assignee. In connection with any such assignment, the transferor Bank
shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee for processing such assignment in
the amount of $2,500.

(d)  Any Bank may at any time assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal Reserve Bank.  No such assignment
shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

(e)  No Assignee, Participant or other transferee of any Bank's rights
shall be entitled to receive any

55
<PAGE>

greater payment under Section 8.03 or 8.04 than such Bank would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the rights transferred, unless such transfer
is made with the Borrower's prior written consent or by reason of the provisions
of Section 8.02, 8.03 or 8.04 requiring such Bank to designate a different
Applicable Lending Office under certain circumstances or at a time when the
circumstances giving rise to such greater payment did not exist.

SECTION 10.07.  Collateral.  Each of the Banks represents to the Agent
and each of the other Banks that it in good faith is not relying upon any
"margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the extension or
maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.

SECTION 10.08.  Governing Law.  This Agreement and each Note shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

SECTION 10.09.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon
the same instrument. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. This Agreement shall become effective upon receipt by the Agent of
counterparts hereof signed by each of the parties hereto (or, in the case of any
party as to which an executed counterpart shall not have been received, receipt
by the Agent in form satisfactory to it of telegraphic, telex, facsimile or
other written confirmation from such party of execution of a counterpart hereof
by such party).

SECTION 10.10.  Judicial Proceedings.  (a)  Consent to Jurisdiction.
Each Obligor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any federal court
sitting in New York City and, in the event that jurisdiction cannot be obtained
or maintained in a federal court, to the jurisdiction of any New York State
court sitting in New York City over any suit, action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to any of the Financing Documents. Each Obligor irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in such court and any claim that any suit, action or
proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Each Obligor agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in such a court shall be

56
<PAGE>

conclusive and binding upon it and will be given effect in Bermuda or the Cayman
Islands, as the case may be, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law
and may be enforced in any federal or New York State court sitting in New York
City (or any other courts to the jurisdiction of which such Obligor is or may be
subject) by a suit upon such judgment, provided that service of process is
effected upon it in one of the manners specified herein or as otherwise
permitted by law.

(b)  Appointment of Agent for Service of Process.  Each Obligor hereby
irrevocably designates and appoints CT Corporation System having an office on
the date hereof at 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019 as its authorized
agent, to accept and acknowledge on its behalf, service of any and all process
which may be served in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to
in subsection (a) above in any federal or New York State court sitting in New
York City. Each Obligor represents and warrants that such agent has agreed in
writing to accept such appointment and that a true copy of such designation and
acceptance has been delivered to the Agent. Said designation and appointment
shall be irrevocable until all principal and interest and all other amounts
payable hereunder and under the Notes shall have been paid in full in accordance
with the provisions hereof and thereof. If such agent shall cease so to act,
each Obligor covenants and agrees to designate irrevocably and appoint without
delay another such agent satisfactory to the Agent and to deliver promptly to
the Agent evidence in writing of such other agent's acceptance of such
appointment.

(c)  Service of Process.  Each Obligor hereby consents to process
being served in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in
subsection (a) above in any federal or New York State court sitting in New York
City by service of process upon the agent of such Obligor for service of process
in such jurisdiction appointed as provided in subsection (b) above; provided
that, to the extent lawful and possible, notice of said service upon such agent
shall be mailed by registered or certified air mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested, to such Obligor at its address specified on the signature
page hereof or to any other address of which such Obligor shall have given
written notice to the Bank. Each Obligor irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all claim of error by reason of any such service in
such manner and agrees that such service shall be deemed in every respect
effective service of process upon such Obligor in any such suit, action or
proceeding and shall, to the fullest extent

57
<PAGE>

permitted by law, be taken and held to be valid and personal service upon and
personal delivery to such Obligor.

(d)  No Limitation on Service or Suit.  Nothing in this Section 10.10
shall affect the right of the Agent or any Bank to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law or limit the right of the Agent or any Bank to bring
proceedings against any Obligor in the courts of any jurisdiction or
jurisdictions.

SECTION 10.11.  Judgment Currency.  If, under any applicable law and
whether pursuant to a judgment being made or registered against any Obligor or
for any other reason, any payment under or in connection with any of the
Financing Documents is made or satisfied in a currency (the "Other Currency")
other than that in which the relevant payment is due (the "Required Currency")
then, to the extent that the payment (when converted into the Required Currency
at the rate of exchange on the date of payment or, if it is not practicable for
the party entitled thereto (the "Payee") to purchase the Required Currency with
the Other Currency on the date of payment, at the rate of exchange as soon
thereafter as it is practicable for it to do so) actually received by the Payee
falls short of the amount due under the terms of this Agreement and the Notes,
each Obligor shall, to the extent permitted by law, as a separate and
independent obligation, indemnify and hold harmless the Payee against the amount
of such short-fall. For the purpose of this Section, "rate of exchange" means
the rate at which the Payee is able on the relevant date to purchase the
Required Currency with the Other Currency and shall take into account any
premium and other costs of exchange.

SECTION 10.12.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH OF THE OBLIGORS, THE AGENT
AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

SECTION 10.13.  Existing Credit Agreement.  On the Closing Date and
simultaneously with the closing the Borrower hereby gives notice to Morgan
Guaranty Trust Company of New York, as agent, under Section 2.09 of the Credit
Agreement referred to in clause (x) of Section 3.01 of the termination of the
Commitments (as defined therein) and the Banks hereby waive the requirement that
prior notice of such termination be given as therein provided.

be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year
first above written.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
<PAGE>

SECTION 1.  Definitions. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined

date hereof in Federal funds the amount heretofore agreed between them.* It is

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

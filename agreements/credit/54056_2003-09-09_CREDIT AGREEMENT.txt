with regard to each Lender individually, the sum of such Lender's share of
outstanding Revolving Loans plus such Lender's Commitment Percentage of
outstanding Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's Revolving
Committed Amount, and (ii) with regard to the Lenders collectively, the sum
of the aggregate amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus the aggregate
amount of all outstanding Swing Line Loans shall not exceed THREE HUNDRED
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ($350,000,000) (as such aggregate maximum amount may
be reduced from time to time as provided herein). Revolving Loans may
consist of Prime Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, or a combination thereof,
as the


20
<PAGE>

Borrower may request, and may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with
the provisions hereof.

(b) Revolving Loan Borrowings.

(i) Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall request a Revolving
Loan borrowing by written notice (or telephone notice promptly
confirmed in writing which confirmation may be by fax) to the Agent
not later than 10:30 A.M. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin time) on the Business
Day of the requested borrowing in the case of Prime Rate Loans, and on
the second Business Day prior to the date of the requested borrowing
in the case of Eurodollar Loans. Each such request for borrowing shall
be irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a Revolving Loan is
requested, (B) the date of the requested borrowing (which shall be a
Business Day), (C) the aggregate principal amount to be borrowed, and
(D) whether the borrowing shall be comprised of Prime Rate Loans,
Eurodollar Loans or a combination thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are
requested, the Interest Period(s) therefor. A form of Notice of
Borrowing a ("Notice of Borrowing") is attached as Exhibit 2.1(b)(i).
If the Borrower shall fail to specify in any such Notice of Borrowing
(I) an applicable Interest Period in the case of a Eurodollar Loan,
then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest
Period of one month, or (II) the type of Revolving Loan requested,
then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for a Prime Rate Loan
hereunder. The Agent shall give notice to each Lender (promptly upon
receipt of each Notice of Borrowing, and in any event not later than
12:00 noon, Milwaukee, Wisconsin time, with respect to any Notice of
Borrowing delivered to the Agent pursuant to this section) of the
contents thereof and each such Lender's share thereof.

(ii) Minimum Amounts. Each Revolving Loan borrowing shall be: (A)
if a Prime Rate Loan, in a minimum aggregate amount of $250,000 and
integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof; and (B) if a
Eurodollar Loan, in a minimum aggregate amount of $2,500,000 and
integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof (or, in either case,
the remaining amount of the Revolving Commitment, if less).

(iii) Advances. Each Lender will make its Commitment Percentage
of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the Agent for the
account of the Borrower at the office of the Agent specified in
Schedule 11.2, or at such other office as the Agent may designate in
writing, by 1:30 P.M. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin time) on the date
specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and in
funds immediately available to the Agent. Such borrowing will then be
made available to the Borrower by the Agent by crediting the account
of the Borrower on the books of such office with the aggregate of the
amounts made available to the Agent by the Lenders and in like funds
as received by the Agent by the close of Agent's business on such
date.

(c) Repayment. The principal amount of all Revolving Loans shall be
due and payable in full on the Revolving Termination Date.

(d) Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1, Revolving
Loans shall bear interest as follows:

21
<PAGE>

(i) Prime Rate Loans. During such periods as Revolving Loans
shall be comprised of Prime Rate Loans, each such Prime Rate Loan
shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of the Prime
Rate;

(ii) Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as Revolving Loans
shall be comprised of Eurodollar Loans, each such Eurodollar Loan
shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of the
applicable Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Percentage; and
Interest on Revolving Loans shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date.

(e) Revolving Notes. The Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by a duly
executed promissory note of the Borrower to each Lender in the original
principal amount of each such Lender's Revolving Committed Amount in
substantially the form of Exhibit 2.1(e).

2.2  Swing Line Loans.

(a) During the Revolving Commitment Period, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Credit Agreement, the Swing Line Lender agrees
to make Swing Line Loans to the Borrower as the Borrower may from time to
time request for the purposes permitted hereby; provided, however, that (i)
the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Swing Line Loans shall
not exceed the Swing Line Sublimit, (ii) the Loans of each Lender shall not
exceed such Lender's Revolving Commitment and (iii) the Loans of all
Lenders shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount at any
time. This is a revolving credit and, subject to the foregoing and the
other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and
reborrow Swing Line Loans as set forth herein without premium or penalty;
provided, however, that Swing Line Lender may terminate or suspend the
Swing Line at any time in its sole discretion upon notice to the Borrower.
Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest at a rate equal to the rate
applicable to Prime Rate Loans or at a rate quoted by the Agent and agreed
to by the Borrower.

(b) Unless notified to the contrary by Swing Line Lender, the Borrower
may irrevocably request a Swing Line Loan upon notice to the Swing Line
Lender. There is no minimum borrowing amount for a Swing Line Loan. Each
such request for a Swing Line Loan shall constitute a representation and
warranty by the Borrower that the conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are
satisfied. Promptly after receipt of such request, the Swing Line Lender
shall obtain telephonic verification from the Agent that such Swing Line
Loan is permitted hereunder. Upon receiving such verification, the Swing
Line Lender shall make such Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower.
Without the consent of Required Lenders and the Swing Line Lender, no Swing
Line Loan shall be made during the continuation of a Default or Event of
Default. Upon the making of each Swing Line Loan, each Lender shall be
deemed to have purchased from the Swing Line Lender a risk participation
therein in an amount equal to that Lender's Commitment Percentage times the
amount of the Swing Line Loan.

(c) Each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate per
annum equal to the rate of interest payable on Prime Rate Loans or at the
rate quoted by the Agent and agreed to by the Borrower and interest shall
be payable upon demand of the Swing Line Lender, on the last day of each
month and on the Revolving Termination Date. The Swing Line Lender


22
<PAGE>

shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower (or notifying the Agent to
so invoice the Borrower) for such interest. The interest payable on Swing
Line Loans is solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender, except
following any funding of a risk participation under clause (f) below.

(d) The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earliest of
(i) upon demand made by Swing Line Lender and (ii) the Revolving
Termination Date. The Borrower shall repay the principal amount of each
Swing Line Loan by payment directly to Swing Line Lender or by Swing Line
Lender debiting the Borrower's deposit account at Swing Line Lender not
later than 10:00 a.m. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin time) for payments hereunder.
If the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 can be satisfied, the
Borrower may request a Revolving Loan to repay Swing Line Lender, or,
failing to make such request, the Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested a Revolving Loan of Prime Rate Loans on such payment date
pursuant to subsection (f) below. Swing Line Lender shall promptly notify
the Agent of each Swing Line Loan and each payment thereof.

(e) If the Borrower fails to timely make any principal or interest
payment on any Swing Line Loan, Swing Line Lender shall notify the Agent of
such fact and the unpaid amount. The Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender of its pro rata share of such amount by 11:00 a.m. (Milwaukee,
Wisconsin time). Each Lender shall make funds in an amount equal to its pro
rata share of such amount available to the Agent at the Agent's payment
office not later than the 2:00 p.m. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin time) for
payments hereunder on the same Business Day. The obligation of each Lender
to make such payment shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by the occurrence of an Event of Default or any other occurrence
or event. Any such payment shall not relieve or otherwise impair the
obligation of the Borrower to repay the Swing Line Lender for any amount of
Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.

(f) If the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 can be
satisfied on any date the Borrower is obligated to, but fails to, repay a
Swing Line Loan, the funding by Lenders pursuant to the previous subsection
shall be deemed to be a borrowing of Prime Rate Loans (without regard to
the minimum amount therefor) deemed requested by the Borrower. If the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 cannot be satisfied on the
date the Borrower is obligated to make, but fails to make, such payment,
the funding by Lenders pursuant to the previous subsection shall be deemed
to be a funding by each Lender of its participation in such Swing Line
Loan, and each Lender making such funding shall thereupon acquire a pro
rata participation, to the extent of its payment, in the claim of Swing
Line Lender against the Borrower in respect of such payment and shall
share, in accordance with that pro rata participation, in any payment made
by the Borrower with respect to such claim. Any amounts made available by a
Lender under its risk participation shall be payable by the Borrower upon
demand of the Agent, and shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the Prime Rate plus 2% per annum.

2.3 [Reserved]

ARTICLE 3

OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

3.1  Default Rate. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an
Event of Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest
on the Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit
Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate which is
equal to the rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is
applicable, whether in respect of interest, fees or other amounts, then the
Prime Rate) plus 2%.

3.2  Extension and Conversion. The Borrower shall have the option, on any
Business Day, to extend existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest
Period or to convert Loans into Loans of another Type; provided, however, that
(i) except as provided in Sections 3.6 and 3.7, Eurodollar Loans may be
converted into Prime Rate Loans only on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, (ii) Eurodollar Loans may be extended, and Prime Rate Loans
may be converted into Eurodollar Loans, only if no Default or Event of Default
is in existence on the date of extension or conversion, (iii) Loans extended as,
or converted into, Eurodollar Loans shall be subject to the terms of the
definition of "Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such
minimum amounts as provided in Section 2.l(b)(ii) and (iv) any request for
extension or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan which shall fail to specify an
Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one
month. Each such extension or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by
giving a Notice of Extension/Conversion in the form of Exhibit 3.2 (or telephone
notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Agent prior to 10:30 A.M.
(Milwaukee, Wisconsin time) on the Business Day of, in the case of the
conversion of a Eurodollar Loan into a Prime Rate Loan and on the second
Business Day prior to, in the case of the extension of a Eurodollar Loan as, or
conversion of a Prime Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan, the date of the
proposed extension or conversion, specifying the date of the proposed extension
or conversion, the Loans to be so extended or converted, the Types of Loans into
which such Loans are to be converted and, if appropriate, the applicable
Interest Periods with respect thereto. Each request for extension or conversion
shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower of the matters
specified in paragraphs (a) and (b), and in (c) or (d), of Section 5.2. In the
event the Borrower fails to request extension or conversion of any Eurodollar
Loan in accordance with this Section, or any such conversion or extension is not
permitted or required by this Section, then such Loans shall be automatically
converted into Prime Rate Loans at the end of their Interest Period. The Agent
shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such proposed
extension or conversion affecting any Loan.

3.3  Reductions in Commitments and Prepayments.

(a) Reductions in Revolving Commitment. The Borrower may from time to
time permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount in whole
or in part without premium or penalty except as provided in Section 3.10
upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent; provided
that after giving effect to any such voluntary reduction the sum of
Revolving Loans plus Swing Line Loans then outstanding shall not exceed the
Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount, as reduced. Except as otherwise
specified herein,


24
<PAGE>

partial reductions in the Aggregate Revolving Committed Amount shall in
each case be in a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 and integral
multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof.

(b) Mandatory Prepayment on Revolving Loans. If at any time the
aggregate amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans plus the aggregate
amount of all outstanding Swing Line Loans shall exceed the Aggregate
Revolving Committed Amount, as reduced from time to time, the Borrower
shall immediately make payment on the Swing Line Loans and then, if
necessary, on the Revolving Loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the
deficiency. Any such payments shall be applied first to Prime Rate Loans
and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct order of their Interest Period
maturities.

(c) Voluntary Prepayments. Loans may be prepaid in whole or in part
without premium or penalty except as provided in Section 3.10. Any partial
prepayment shall be (i) if a Prime Rate Loan, in a minimum aggregate amount
of $250,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof; and (ii)
if a Eurodollar Loan, in a minimum aggregate amount of $2,500,000 and
integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof (or, in either case, the
remaining outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans). Except as
otherwise specified herein, amounts prepaid on the Revolving Loans may be
reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

3.4  Fees.

(a) Upfront Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the
benefit of the Lenders, the upfront fee (the "Upfront Fee") referred to in
that certain Lenders' fee letter of even date herewith. The Upfront Fee
shall be earned and payable as set forth in such letter.

(b) Unused Facility Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for
the ratable benefit of the Lenders, an unused facility fee (the "Unused
Facility Fee") in an amount equal to the product of (i) the average daily
unused portion of the Revolving Committed Amount, as the same may be
reduced from time to time hereunder, (computed on a quarterly basis in
arrears as of the last day of each June, September, December and March
commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter during which the Closing
Date occurs, based upon the daily utilization for that quarter as
calculated by the Agent) multiplied by (ii) the Applicable Percentage
divided by four. The Unused Facility Fee shall be due and payable quarterly
in arrears on the last day of each June, September, December and March
commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter during which the Closing
Date occurs, through the Revolving Termination Date (provided, that if the
last day of any such quarter is not a Business Day, then such payment shall
be due on the first Business Day thereafter). The Unused Facility Fee shall
be fully earned and payable on each such payment date. For purposes of
computing the Unused Facility Fee under this subsection 3.4(b), usage of
the Swing Line Sublimit shall not be considered usage of the Revolving
Committed Amount.

(c) Other Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent such other
closing, administrative and structuring fees referred to in that certain
Agent's fee letter of even date herewith.

25
<PAGE>

3.5  Capital Adequacy. If any Lender has reasonably determined that the
adoption or effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding
capital adequacy made after the date hereof, or any change therein made after
the date hereof, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof
by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof made after the date hereof, or
compliance by such Lender or its parent company with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency made after the date hereof, has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or its
parent company's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or
obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into
consideration the policies of such Lender and its parent company with respect to
capital adequacy), then, within 10 Business Days after the Borrower's receipt of
the certificate referred to in the next sentence, the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender and its
parent company for such reduction; provided that no such amounts shall be
payable with respect to reduction in rate of return incurred more than three (3)
months before such Lender demands compensation under this Section 3.5. A
certificate as to the amount of such reduction in rate of return, the good faith
basis therefor and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by
the applicable Lender to arrive at the amount or amounts claimed to be due,
shall be submitted to the Borrower and the Agent. Each determination by a Lender
of amounts owing under this Section shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of
the matters set forth therein. No demand for payment under this Section shall be
made unless the Lender shall make comparable demands of other similarly situated
borrowers. The provisions of this Section shall survive termination of this
Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

3.6  Inability To Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of any
Interest Period, the Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, the
Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (a) any
Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period
shall be made as Prime Rate Loans, (b) any Loans that were to have been
converted on the first day of such Interest Period to or continued as Eurodollar
Loans shall be converted to or continued as Prime Rate Loans and (c) any
outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such
Interest Period, to Prime Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by
the Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor
shall the Borrower have the right to convert Prime Rate Loans to Eurodollar
Loans.

3.7  Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof occurring after the Closing Date shall make it unlawful for
any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Credit
Agreement, (a) such Lender shall promptly give written notice of such
circumstances to the Borrower and the Agent (which notice shall be withdrawn
whenever such circumstances no longer exist), (b) the commitment of such Lender
hereunder to make


26
<PAGE>

Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and convert a Prime Rate
Loan to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be canceled and, until such time as it
shall no longer be unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar
Loans, such Lender shall then have a commitment only to make a Prime Rate Loan
when a Eurodollar Loan is requested and (c) such Lender's Loans then outstanding
as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Prime Rate
Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with
respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any
such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day
of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay
to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section
3.10.

3.8  Requirements of Law. If the adoption of or any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof applicable to
any Lender, or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether
or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority, in each case made subsequent to the Closing Date (or, if later, the
date on which such Lender becomes a Lender):

(a) (shall subject such Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever on or
in respect of any Eurodollar Loans made by it or its obligation to make
Eurodollar Loans, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such
Lender in respect thereof except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section
3.9 (including Non-Excluded Taxes imposed solely by reason of any failure
of such Lender to comply with its obligations under Section 3.9(b)) and
changes in taxes measured by or imposed upon the overall net income, or
franchise tax (imposed in lieu of such net income tax), of such Lender or
any branch or Affiliate thereof); or

(b) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
deposit, compulsory loan or similar condition or requirement against assets
held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances,
loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds
by, any office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the
determination of the Eurodollar Rate hereunder;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into,
continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans, or to reduce any amount receivable
hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, upon notice to the
Borrower from such Lender, through the Agent, in accordance herewith, the
Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount
receivable, provided that, in any such case, the Borrower may elect to convert
the Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender hereunder to Prime Rate Loans by giving
the Agent at least one Business Day's notice of such election, in which case the
Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender, upon demand, without duplication,
such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 3.10. If any Lender
becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it
shall provide prompt notice thereof to the Borrower, through the Agent,
certifying (a) that one of the events described in this Section 3.8 has occurred
and describing in reasonable detail the nature of such event, (b) as to the
increased cost or reduced amount resulting from such event and (c) as to the
additional amount demanded by such Lender and a reasonably detailed


27
<PAGE>

explanation of the calculation thereof. Such a certificate as to any additional
amounts payable pursuant to this subsection shall be submitted by such Lender,
through the Agent, to the Borrower and shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. No demand for payment under this Section shall be made unless
the Lender shall make comparable demands of other similarly situated borrowers.
This covenant shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

3.9  Taxes.

(a) Except as provided below in this subsection, all payments made by
the Borrower under this Credit Agreement and any Notes shall be made free
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of,
any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts,
duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter
imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental
Authority, excluding taxes measured by or imposed upon the overall net
income of any Lender or any branch or Affiliate thereof, and all franchise
taxes, branch taxes, taxes on doing business or taxes on the overall
capital or net worth of any Lender, or any branch or Affiliate thereof, in
each case imposed in lieu of net income taxes, imposed: (i) by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender, branch or Affiliate is
organized or is located, or in which its principal executive office is
located, or any nation within which such jurisdiction is located or any
political subdivision thereof; or (ii) by reason of any connection between
the jurisdiction imposing such tax and such Lender, branch or Affiliate
other than a connection arising solely from such Lender having executed,
delivered or performed its obligations, or received payment under or
enforced, this Credit Agreement or any Notes. If any such non-excluded
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings
("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable
to the Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any Notes, (A) the amounts so
payable to the Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent
necessary to yield to the Agent or such Lender (after payment of all
Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at
the rates or in the amounts specified in this Credit Agreement and any
Notes, provided, however, that the Borrower shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold any Non-Excluded Taxes and shall not be required to increase any
such amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof if such Lender fails to
comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this subsection whenever
any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower, and (B) as promptly as
possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Agent for its own
account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified
copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing
payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when
due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Agent the
required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower
shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes,
interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as
a result of any such failure. The agreements in this subsection shall
survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b) At least five Business Days prior to the first day on which
interest or Fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Lender, each
Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of
America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to each of


28
<PAGE>

the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United States
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, certifying in either case
that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and
the Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes. Each Lender which so delivers a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN further
undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional
copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that such
form expires (currently, three successive calendar years) or becomes
obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or
extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender is entitled
to receive payments under this Credit Agreement and the Notes without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless
an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law or
regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form
with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Agent that
it is not capable of receiving payments without any deductions or
withholding of United States federal income tax.

3.10 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold
each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or
incur (other than through such Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct)
as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of,
conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given
a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Credit
Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of a Eurodollar
Loan after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the
provisions of this Credit Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of
Eurodollar Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with
respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so
prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the
date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the
last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on
the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for
such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein over (ii) the amount of interest (as
reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on
such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with
leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market, provided, however, that the
amount of such lost interest, if any, shall be discounted to a present value as
of the date of the indemnification payment, using as the applicable discount
rate(s) the rate(s) of per annum interest used by such Lender in making the
computations pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii). Any Lender seeking indemnity
under this Section shall furnish a certificate to the Agent and the Borrower
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such Lender's indemnity claim.
This covenant shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

3.11 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

29
<PAGE>

(a) Loans. Each Loan, each payment or prepayment of principal of any
Loan, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of Fees (other
than fees payable to the Agent for its own account pursuant to Section
3.4), each reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount, and each conversion
or extension of any Loan, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in
accordance with the respective Commitment Percentages relating to such
respective Loans.

(b) Advances. Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by
any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount
that would constitute its Commitment Percentage of such borrowing available
to the Agent, the Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount
available to the Agent, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such
amount is not made available to the Agent by such Lender within the time
period specified therefor hereunder, such Lender shall pay to the Agent, on
demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the Federal
Funds Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately
available to the Agent. A certificate of the Agent submitted to any Lender
with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive
in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's Commitment Percentage of
such borrowing is not made available to the Agent by such Lender within two
business Days of the date of the related borrowing, (i) the Agent shall
notify the Borrower of the failure of such Lender to make such amount
available to the Agent and the Agent shall also be entitled to recover such
amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to Prime Rate
Loans hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower and (ii) then the Borrower
may, without waiving any rights it may have against such Lender, (x)
request any one or more of the Lenders to increase its Commitment
Percentage and make such borrowing available, which request each such
Lender may in its sole discretion approve or deny, and (y) if any Lender
serving as Agent shall deny a request submitted to it pursuant to the
foregoing clause (x), borrow a like amount on an unsecured basis from any
commercial bank for a period ending on the date upon which such Lender does
in fact make such borrowing available; provided, however, that at the time
any such replacement borrowing is made and at all times while such amount
is outstanding the Borrower would be permitted to borrow such amount
pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Credit Agreement.

3.12 Sharing of Payments. The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the
event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise
of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured
claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security
or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such
payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly
purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans and other
obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time,
as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in
accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit
Agreement. The Lenders further agree among themselves that if payment to a
Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff,
banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or
must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of
such


30
<PAGE>

payment shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its
share of that benefit (together with its share of any accrued interest payable
with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or
otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a
participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights
of payment, including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or
other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender or the Agent shall
fail to remit to the Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender
or the Agent to the Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement
on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made together with
interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due until the date
such amount is paid to the Agent or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal
to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to
which this Section 3.12 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable,
exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with
the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.12 to share in the benefits of
any recovery on such secured claim.

3.13 Place and Manner of Payments. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all payments hereunder shall be made to the Agent in Dollars in
immediately available funds, without offset, deduction, counterclaim or
withholding of any kind, at its offices at the Agent's office specified in
Schedule 11.2 not later than 1:00 P.M. (Milwaukee, Wisconsin time) on the date
when due. Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day. The Agent may, at the Borrower's
request, debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time to
Account No. 112045887 maintained by the Borrower with the Agent or any other
account which may be maintained by the Borrower with the Agent and designated
for such purpose by the Borrower. The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any
payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Agent the Loans, Fees or
other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be
applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, or if such application
would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Agent shall distribute such
payment to the Lenders in such manner as the Agent may determine to be
appropriate in respect of obligations owing by the Borrower hereunder, subject
to the terms of Section 3.11). The Agent will distribute such payments to such
Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to 1:00 p.m. (Milwaukee,
Wisconsin time) on a Business Day in like funds as received prior to the end of
such Business Day and otherwise the Agent will distribute such payment to such
Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder
shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date
thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, except that in
the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be
made in the next following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be
made on the next preceding Business Day. All computations of interest and fees
shall be made on the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360
days except computations of interest on Prime Rate Loans, which shall be made on
the basis of actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as
applicable. Interest shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing, but
exclude the date of payment.

3.14 [Reserved]

<PAGE>

3.15 Transfers at Borrower's Request. In the event that any Lender requests
payment by the Borrower of any additional amounts pursuant to Section 3.5, 3.7,
3.8 or 3.9, then, provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing at such time, the Borrower may, at its own expense (such expense
to include any transfer fee payable to the Agent under Section 11.6(b)), and in
its sole discretion require such Lender to transfer and assign in whole or in
part, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 11.6(b)), all or part of its interests, rights and
obligations under this Credit Agreement to an Eligible Transferee which shall
assume such assigned obligations; provided that (i) the other Lenders may, by
written notice to the Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower, in their respective
discretion, elect to assume such Lender's Revolving Commitment, pro rata based
upon the respective Commitment Percentages of the other Lenders so electing to
assume such Lender's Revolving Commitments hereunder, (ii) such Eligible
Transferee which is not a Lender shall be reasonably acceptable to the Required
Lenders, (iii) such assignment shall not relieve the Borrower from its
obligations to pay such additional amounts that may be due in accordance with
Section 3.5, 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9, (iv) such assignment shall not conflict with any
law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority
and (v) the Borrower or such Eligible Transferee shall have paid to the
assigning Lender in immediately available funds the principal of and interest
accrued to the date of such payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all
accrued Fees and other amounts owed to it hereunder.

ARTICLE 4

GUARANTY

4.1  The Guaranty. Each of the Credit Parties hereby jointly and severally
guarantees to each Lender and the Agent as hereinafter provided the prompt
payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) strictly in
accordance with the terms thereof. The Credit Parties hereby further agree that
if any of the Credit Party Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise), the
Credit Parties will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any
demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of
payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same will be
promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such
extension or renewal.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other
of the Credit Documents, the guaranty obligations of each Credit Party hereunder
shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would
not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any applicable state
law.

4.2  Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Credit Parties under
Section 4.1 hereof are joint and several, absolute and unconditional,
irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity or enforceability of any of the
Credit Documents, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or
any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee


32
<PAGE>

of or security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance
whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or
defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that
the obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances other than indefeasible payment in
full. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the
occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the
liability of any Credit Party hereunder which shall remain absolute and
unconditional as described above:

(a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Credit
Party, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Credit
Party Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance
shall be waived;

(b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any of the
Credit Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred therein
shall be done or omitted;

(c) the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be modified,
supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the
Credit Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein
shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Credit Party
Obligations or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in
whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

(d) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Agent or any Lender or
Lenders as security for any of the Credit Party Obligations shall fail to
attach or be perfected; or

(e) any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be determined to be void
or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor
of any Credit Party) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person
(including, without limitation, any creditor of any Credit Party).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Credit Party hereby expressly
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices
whatsoever, and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender exhaust any right,
power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit Documents
or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or against any other
Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Credit Party
Obligations.

4.3  Reinstatement. The obligations of the Credit Parties under this
Section 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any
reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party
Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of
the Credit Party Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in
bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each Credit Party agrees that it
will indemnify each of the Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against
any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent
transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

33
<PAGE>

4.4  Certain Additional Waivers. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of any other Section of this Section 4, each Credit Party further
agrees that it shall have no right of recourse to security for the Credit Party
Obligations. Each of the Credit Parties further agrees that it shall have no
right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity, nor any right of recourse to
security, if any, for the Credit Party Obligations until indefeasible payment in
full of all such obligations shall have been made.

4.5  Remedies. The Credit Parties agree that, as between the Credit
Parties, on the one hand, and the Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, the
Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due (and payable as
provided in Section 9 hereof and shall be deemed to have become automatically
due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9) for purposes of
Section 4.1 hereof notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition
preventing such declaration (or preventing such Credit Party Obligations from
becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in
the event of such declaration (or such Credit Party Obligations being deemed to
have become automatically due and payable), such Credit Party Obligations
whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due
and payable by the Credit Parties for purposes of said Section 4.1.

4.6  Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Section 4 is a continuing
guarantee, and shall apply to all Credit Party Obligations whenever arising.

ARTICLE 6

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Lenders to enter into this Credit Agreement and to make the
Loans herein provided for, each of the Credit Parties hereby represents and
warrants to the Agent and to each Lender that as of the Closing Date, and at all
times thereafter (except as specifically set forth below in this Section 6):

6.1  Financial Statements. Prior to the Closing Date the Borrower has or
will have furnished to the Lenders (a) the audited consolidated balance sheet of
the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and
related audited statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
the year ended on that date, together with an unqualified opinion thereon by
Ernst & Young LLP, and (b) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 15, 2003 and related
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the periods ended
on such date, prepared by the Borrower. Such financial statements were prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved,
are correct and complete and fairly present the consolidated financial condition
of the Borrower and such Subsidiaries as of such dates and the results of their
operations for the periods ended on such dates, subject, in the case of the
unaudited interim statements, to the absence of footnotes, audit and normal
year-end adjustments. Since June 15, 2003 there has been no development or event
which has had a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 6.1 sets forth the last day of
the Borrower's fiscal quarters for the period from the third fiscal quarter of
2003 through the fiscal year end 2008.

6.2  Ownership of Properties; Liens and Encumbrances. Each of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title (or has an interest as a
lessee) to all property, real and personal, as reflected on the most recent
financial statement of the Borrower furnished to the Lenders, and all property
purported to have been acquired (or leased) since the date of such financial
statement, except property sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course
of business, the property of any Subsidiaries that are sold through an asset
sale or otherwise disposed of and the return of any leased property upon the
termination of any lease subsequent to such date; and all such property is free
of any Lien except Permitted Liens. To the Borrower's knowledge, all owned and
leased buildings and equipment of the Borrower used in the Borrower's business
are in good operating condition, repair and working order, except for ordinary
wear and tear and insured losses, and, to the Borrower's knowledge, conform to
all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations the violation of which would
have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Borrower's knowledge, the Borrower
possesses adequate trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, service marks
and licenses, or rights thereto, for the present and planned future conduct of
its business substantially as now conducted, without any known conflict with the
rights of others which would result in a Material Adverse Effect.

37
<PAGE>

6.3  Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (a) is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing (or
similar concept under applicable law, including, without limitation, the concept
of active status under the laws of the State of Wisconsin) under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b) has the corporate power and authority and
the legal right to own and operate all its material property, to lease the
material property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it
is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign limited liability
company or corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction
where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law; except to the extent that the failure to comply with any of
(a) through (d) would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.4  Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. Each of the
Borrower and the other Credit Parties has full power and authority and the legal
right to make, deliver and perform the Credit Documents to which it is party and
has taken all necessary limited liability company or corporate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of the Credit Documents
to which it is party. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or
other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is
required in connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution,
delivery or performance of any Credit Document by the Borrower or the other
Credit Parties (other than those which have been obtained or which the failure
to obtain would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect) or with
the validity or enforceability of any Credit Document against the Borrower or
the Guarantors. Each Credit Document to which it is a party has been duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower or the other Credit Parties, as
the case may be. Each Credit Document to which it is a party constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower or the Guarantors, as the
case may be, enforceable against the Borrower or the other Credit Parties, as
the case may be, in accordance with its terms.

6.5  No Legal Bar; No Default. The execution, delivery and performance of
the Credit Documents, the borrowings thereunder and the use of the proceeds of
the Loans will not violate any Requirement of Law the violation of which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or any Contractual
Obligation of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries the violation of which would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (except those as to
which waivers or consents have been obtained), and will not result in, or
require, the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on
any of its or their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any
Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation. Neither the Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual
Obligations in any respect which would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

6.6  No Material Litigation. Except as set forth in the Audited Financial
Statements, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower and the other Credit Parties, threatened by or against the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective properties or
revenues (a) with respect to the Credit Documents or any Loan or any of the
transactions


38
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby, or (b) which, if adversely determined, would
reasonably be expected to (i) cause an adverse financial effect on the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $20,000,000 or (ii) have a Material
Adverse Effect.

6.7  Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any of the other
Credit Parties is an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

6.8  Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder
will be used directly or indirectly for any purpose which violates, or which
would be inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time
hereafter in effect. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a group do not
own "margin stock" except margin stock which is a Permitted Investment, but only
to the extent otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

6.9  ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding
deficiency" within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code (or Section 302 of
ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan
has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA
and the Code, except to the extent that any such occurrence or failure to comply
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred resulting in any liability
that has remained underfunded, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has
arisen, during such five-year period which would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accrued benefits under each
Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did
not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such
Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by an amount which, as determined in
accordance with GAAP, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity is currently
subject to any liability for a complete or partial withdrawal from a
Multiemployer Plan which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Section 6.9 only, the parties hereto agree that
"Material Adverse Effect" shall include any event referred to in this Section
6.9 which would or could be reasonably expected to cause a reduction in
Consolidated Net Worth of ten percent (10%) or more.

6.10 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in Schedule 6.10 and except
to the extent that all of the following, in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

(a) To the knowledge of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties, the
facilities and properties owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries (the "Properties") do not contain any Materials of
Environmental Concern in amounts or concentrations which (i) constitute a
violation of, or (ii) could give rise to liability under, any Environmental
Law.

(b) To the knowledge of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties, the
Properties and all operations at the Properties are in compliance, and have
in the last five years


39
<PAGE>

been in compliance, in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and there is no contamination at, under or about the
Properties or violation of any Environmental Law with respect to the
Properties or the business operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Business").

(c) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice of violation, alleged violation, non-compliance, liability or
potential liability regarding environmental matters or compliance with
Environmental Laws with regard to any of the Properties or the Business,
nor do the Borrower nor the other Credit Parties have knowledge or reason
to believe that any such notice will be received or is being threatened.

(d) To the knowledge of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties,
Materials of Environmental Concern have not been transported or disposed of
from the Properties in violation of, or in a manner or to a location which
could give rise to liability under any Environmental Law, nor have any
Materials of Environmental Concern been generated, treated, stored or
disposed of at, on or under any of the Properties in violation of, or in a
manner that could give rise to liability under, any applicable
Environmental Law.

(e) No judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative action is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties,
threatened, under any Environmental Law to which the Borrower or any
Subsidiary is or will be named as a party with respect to the Properties or
the Business, nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent
orders, administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative or
judicial requirements outstanding under any Environmental Law with respect
to the Properties or the Business.

(f) To the knowledge of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties,
there has been no unremediated release or threat of release of Materials of
Environmental Concern at or from the Properties, or arising from or related
to the operations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with the
Properties or otherwise in connection with the Business, in violation of or
in amounts or in a manner that could give rise to liability under
Environmental Laws.

6.11 Use of Proceeds. The Loans hereunder may be used for repayment in full
on the Closing Date of all loans and other obligations outstanding under the
Existing Credit Agreement and for working capital and other general corporate
purposes not prohibited by this Credit Agreement, but expressly including

and all other amounts under the Credit Documents shall immediately become
due and payable, and (B) if such event is any other Event of Default,

consent of the Required Lenders, the Agent may, or upon the written request
of the Required Lenders, the Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower declare
the Revolving Commitments to be terminated forthwith, whereupon the
Revolving Commitments shall immediately terminate; and (ii) with the
written consent of the Required Lenders the Agent may, or upon the written

and payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and
payable. Except as expressly provided above in this Section 9, presentment,

AGENCY PROVISIONS

10.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints U.S. Bank
National Association as Agent hereunder of such Lender to act as specified
herein and in the other Credit Documents, and each such Lender hereby authorizes
the Agent as the agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated by the
terms hereof and of the other Credit Documents, together with such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary elsewhere herein and in the other Credit Documents, the Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein and
therein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
be read into this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents, or
shall otherwise exist against the Agent. The provisions of this Section are
solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and none of the Credit
Parties shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of the provisions
hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Credit Agreement and
the other Credit Documents, the Agent shall act solely as agent of the Lenders
and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or
relationship of agency or trust with or for the Borrower or any other Credit
Party.

<PAGE>

10.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties
hereunder or under the other Credit Documents by or through agents or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care.

10.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i)
liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person
under or in connection herewith or in connection with any of the other Credit
Documents except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct, or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any of the Credit
Parties contained herein or in any of the other Credit Documents or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Agent under or in connection herewith or in connection with
the other Credit Documents, or enforceability or sufficiency herefor of any of
the other Credit Documents, or for any failure of the Borrower to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender for the effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectability or sufficiency of this Credit Agreement, or any of the other
Credit Documents or for any representations, warranties, recitals or statements
made herein or therein or made by the Borrower or any Credit Party in any
written or oral statement or in any financial or other statements, instruments,
reports, certificates or any other documents in connection herewith or therewith
furnished or made by the Agent to the Lenders or by or on behalf of the Credit
Parties to the Agent or any Lender or be required to ascertain or inquire as to
the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions,
covenants or agreements contained herein or therein or as to the use of the
proceeds of the Loans or of the existence or possible existence of any Default
or Event of Default or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Credit
Parties.

10.4 Reliance on Communications. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice,
consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or
teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by
it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including,
without limitation, counsel to the Agent and any of the Lenders, independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Agent with reasonable care). The
Agent may deem and treat the Lenders as the owner of their respective interests
hereunder for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or
transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Agent in accordance with Section
11.6(d). The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Credit Agreement or under any of the other Credit Documents
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required
Lenders, or all Lenders, as the case may be, as it deems appropriate. The Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting,
hereunder or under any of the other Credit Documents in accordance with a
request of the Required Lenders (or to the extent specifically provided in
Section 11.1, all the Lenders) and such request and any action taken or failure
to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders (including their
successors and assigns).

52
<PAGE>

10.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder (other
than the failure by the Borrower to pay any principal or interest on any Note
when due in accordance with the terms thereof or hereof) unless the Agent has
received notice from a Lender or a Credit Party referring to the Credit
Document, stating that a Default or Event of Default exists, and specifying the
particulars thereof. In the event that the Agent receives such a notice or the
Borrower fails to pay any principal or interest on any Note when due, the Agent
shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be directed by
the Required Lenders, otherwise than an action that the Agent reasonably
believes would be a violation of law or otherwise prohibited by the Credit
Documents.

10.6 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly
acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any representations
or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent or any Affiliate thereof
hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, assets, operations, property, financial and
other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Borrower and made its
own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Credit Agreement.
Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance
upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Credit Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other
conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations, assets, property, financial or other conditions, prospects or
creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the possession of the Agent
or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates.

10.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent in its
capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their
respective Commitment Percentages (or if the Revolving Commitments have expired
or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of
outstanding Loans of the Lenders), from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time
(including, without limitation, at any time following the termination of this
Credit Agreement) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent in
its capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out of this Credit
Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of
the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,


53
<PAGE>

penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent. If any indemnity
furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the reasonable opinion of the
Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for additional
indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until
such additional indemnity is furnished.

10.8  Agent in its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may
make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business
with the Borrower or any other Credit Party as though the Agent were not Agent
hereunder. With respect to its Loans, the Agent shall have the same rights,
obligations and powers under this Credit Agreement as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though they were not Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.

10.9  Successor Agent. The Agent may, at any time, resign upon 20 days'
written notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent (which shall
be a Lender) with the prior written consent of the Borrower, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30
days after the notice of resignation, as appropriate, then the retiring Agent
shall select a successor Agent provided such successor is a Lender hereunder or
a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of
any State thereof and has a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a
successor, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and
the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Agent,
as appropriate, under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and
the provisions of this Section 10.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Credit
Agreement.

10.10 Lead Arranger, Co-Syndication Agents, Co-Documentation Agents, Senior
Managing Agent and Managing Agents. The Lenders identified on the title page to
this Agreement as "Lead Arranger," "Co-Syndication Agents," "Co-Documentation
Agents," "Senior Managing Agent" and "Managing Agents" shall have no right,
power, obligation or liability other than those applicable to all Lenders as
such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders so identified shall
have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each
Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any Lender so
identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or omitting any
action hereunder.

ARTICLE 11

consent of the Required Lenders, the Agent may,


54
<PAGE>

from time to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower written amendments,
supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Credit Documents for the
purpose of adding, amending or deleting any provisions of this Credit Agreement
or the other Credit Documents or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the
Required Lenders may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this
Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents or any Default or Event of
Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such
amendment, waiver, supplement, modification or release shall (i) reduce the
amount or extend the scheduled date of maturity of any Loan or Note or any
installment thereon, or reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable
hereunder (other than interest at the increased post-default rate) or extend the
scheduled date of any payment thereof or increase the amount or extend the
expiration date of any Lender's Revolving Commitment, in each case without the
written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, or (ii) amend, modify
or waive any provision of this Section 11.1 or reduce the percentage specified
in the definition of Required Lenders, or consent to the assignment or transfer

amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 10 without the written consent
of the then Agent, (iv) amend Section 3.12 or 7.10 without the written consent
of all Lenders, or (v) release the obligation of any Guarantor under the
Guaranty if such release would cause the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, as a group,
to exceed the Threshold Requirement. Any such waiver, any such amendment,
supplement or modification and any such release shall apply equally to each of
the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Borrower, the Lenders, the Agent and
all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the
Lenders and the Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights
hereunder and under the outstanding Loans and Notes and other Credit Documents,
and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any such Lender, (ii)
legal proceedings commenced against or disputes among the Agent or any Lender by
any other Lender or its participants or the Agent, or (iii) the violation by the
Agent or any such Lender of an express provision of the Credit Documents, if so
determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The
agreements in this Section 11.5 shall survive repayment of the Loans, Notes and
all other amounts payable hereunder.

11.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing Lenders.

(a) This Credit Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Agent, all future holders of the
Notes and their respective


57
<PAGE>

successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer
any of its rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement or the other
Credit Documents without the prior written consent of each Lender and no
Lender may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Credit Agreement or the other Credit Documents without the prior written
consent of the Borrower, except as otherwise permitted by this Section
11.6.

(b) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law and, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Borrower if
the Participant (as defined below) is not an Affiliate of such Lender
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), at any time sell to one
or more banks or other entities ("Participant" or "Participants")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by
such Lender, any Revolving Commitment of such Lender, or any other interest
of such Lender hereunder, provided, however, that at all times such Lender
shall retain for its own account interests in Loans owing to such Lender in
an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when added to the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of any interests in Loans sold by
such Lender to Participants who are Affiliates of such Lender, equals not
less than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate principal amount of all such
Lender's outstanding Loans. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of
participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under
this Credit Agreement to the other parties to this Credit Agreement shall
remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note
for all purposes under this Credit Agreement, and the Borrower and the
Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
Agreement. No Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which
the Participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of
this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent
such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the scheduled maturity of any
Loan or Note or any installment thereon in which such Participant is
participating, or reduce the stated rate or extend the time of payment of
interest or Fees thereon except in connection with a waiver of interest at
the increased post-default rate) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or
increase the amount of the Participant's participation over the amount
thereof then in effect it being understood that a waiver of any Default or
Event of Default shall not constitute a change in the terms of such
participation, and that an increase in any Revolving Commitment or Loan
shall be permitted without consent of any Participant if the Participant's
participation is not increased as a result thereof, or (ii) consent to the
assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations
under this Credit Agreement. In the case of any such participation, the
Participant shall not have any rights under this Credit Agreement or any of
the other Credit Documents (the Participant's rights against such Lender in
respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement
executed by such Lender in favor of the Participant relating thereto) and
all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if
such Lender had not sold such participation, provided that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 11.5
with respect to its participation in the Revolving Commitments and the
Loans outstanding from time to time; provided, that no Participant shall be
entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the
transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the
amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such
Participant had no such transfer occurred.

58
<PAGE>

(c) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking
business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell or assign
(i) to any Lender or any Affiliate thereof, except that any such sale or
assignment shall be made only with the consent of the Borrower if such sale
or assignment would increase any amount payable by the Borrower hereunder,
or (ii) to one or more additional banks or financial institutions
("Purchasing Lenders"), except that any such sale or assignment shall be
made only with the consent of the Agent and, so long as no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing or at any time if any such sale or
assignment would increase any amount payable by the Borrower hereunder, the
consent of the Borrower: all or any part of its rights and obligations
under this Credit Agreement and the Notes in minimum amounts of $10,000,000
(or, if less, the entire amount of such Lender's obligations) if the
Purchasing Lender is not a Lender hereunder, or with no minimum amount if
the Purchasing Lender is a Lender hereunder, pursuant to a Commitment
Transfer Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Lender, such transferor
Lender (and, in the case of a Purchasing Lender that is not then a Lender
or an Affiliate thereof so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, by the Borrower and the Agent), and delivered to the Agent for
its acceptance and recording in the Register (as defined below). Upon such
execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the Transfer
Effective Date specified in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (x) the
Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent
provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and
obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Revolving Commitment as set forth
therein, and (y) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its
obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of a Commitment
Transfer Supplement covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor
Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement, such
transferor Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). Such Commitment
Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Credit Agreement to the
extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such
Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages
arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of
the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Credit
Agreement and the Notes. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date
specified in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, the Borrower, at its own
expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the Note
delivered to the Agent pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement a
new Note to the order of such Purchasing Lender in an amount equal to the
Revolving Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Commitment Transfer
Supplement and, unless the transferor Lender has not retained a Revolving
Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the transferor Lender in
an amount equal to the Revolving Commitment retained by it hereunder.
Except for the expense of executing and delivering such new Note to the
Agent pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay
any transfer fees, costs or expenses to the Agent or any Lender in
connection with any such transfer. Such new Note shall be dated the Closing
Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Note replaced thereby. The
Note surrendered by the transferor Lender shall be returned by the Agent to
the Borrower marked "canceled."

(d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section
11.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer supplement delivered to it and a
register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders and the Revolving Commitment of, and principal amount of the
Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the


59
<PAGE>

Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all
purposes of this Credit Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e) Upon its receipt of a Commitment Transfer Supplement executed by a
transferor Lender and a Purchasing Lender and, in the case of a Purchasing
Lender that is not then a Lender (or an Affiliate thereof, by the Borrower
and the Agent) together with payment to the Agent by the transferor Lender
or the Purchasing Lender, (as agreed between them) of a registration and
processing fee of $3,500 for each Purchasing Lender listed in such
Commitment Transfer Supplement, and the Notes subject to such Commitment
Transfer Supplement, the Agent shall (i) accept such Commitment Transfer
Supplement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register
and (iii) give prompt notice of such acceptance and recordation to the
Lenders and the Borrower.

(f) The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant
or Purchasing Lender each, (a "Transferee") and any permitted prospective
Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender's possession
concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such
Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Credit Agreement or
which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in
connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower and its
Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Credit Agreement.

(g) At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 11.6 to a
Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United
States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
for Federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall
provide to the Borrower and the Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue
Service Forms (and, if applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate)
described in Section 3.9.

(h) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or
assigning any of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including, without
limitation, any right to payment of principal and interest under any Note)
to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with applicable laws.

11.7 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off), each
Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such
notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, to setoff and appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other
credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or
owing by such Lender or any Affiliate, branch or agency thereof to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower, or any part thereof in such amounts as
such Lender may elect, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities
of the Borrower to such Lender hereunder and claims of every nature and
description of such Lender against the


60
<PAGE>

Borrower, in any currency, whether arising hereunder, under the Notes or under
any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein, as such Lender
may elect, whether or not such Lender has made any demand for payment. The
aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such Lender against the Borrower
or against any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of
the Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or
any such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit
of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor,
notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been
exercised by such Lender prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such
set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

11.8  Confidentiality. The Agent and each Lender shall hold in confidence
any material nonpublic information delivered or made available to them by the
Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Agent
or any Lender from disclosing any information delivered or made available to it
by the Borrower (a) to such Lender's Affiliates, the Agent or any Lender, (b)
upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (c) upon the request or
demand of any regulatory agency or authority, (d) which has been publicly
disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure by the Agent or any Lender
which is not permitted by this Agreement, (e) to the extent reasonably required
in connection with any litigation to which the Agent, any Lender, or any of
their respective Affiliates may be a party, along with the Borrower, any
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, (f) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy under this
Agreement, (g) to such Agent's or Lender's legal counsel and financial
consultants and independent auditors, and (h) to any Transferee or permitted
prospective Transferee and such Transferee or permitted prospective Transferee
agrees in writing to be bound by the duty of confidentiality under this Section
to the same extent as if it were a Lender hereunder. Further, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any party hereto (and any employee,
representative or other agent of such party) may disclose to any Person, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including tax
opinions or other tax analyses) provided to it relating to such tax treatment
and tax structure.

11.9  Table of Contents and Section Headings. The table of contents and the
Section and subsection headings herein are intended for convenience only and

11.10 Counterparts. This Credit Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Credit Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and
all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and
the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Credit Agreement signed by all
the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Agent.

11.11 Severability. Any provision of this Credit Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such


61
<PAGE>

prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

11.12 Integration. This Credit Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit
Documents represent the agreement of the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by the Agent, the Borrower or any
Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred
to herein or in the Notes.

11.13 Governing Law. This Credit Agreement and the Notes and the rights and
obligations of the parties under this Credit Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of Wisconsin without giving effect to its conflicts of law
provisions.

11.14 Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue. All judicial proceedings brought
against the Borrower or any other Credit Party with respect to this Credit
Agreement, any Note or any of the other Credit Documents shall be brought in any
state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Wisconsin, and,
by execution and delivery of this Credit Agreement, the Borrower and each of the
other Credit Parties accepts, for itself and in connection with its properties,
generally and unconditionally, the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any final judgment rendered thereby
in connection with this Credit Agreement from which no appeal has been taken or
is available. The Borrower, each of the other Credit Parties, the Agent and the
Lenders irrevocably waive any objection, including, without limitation, any
objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens
which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or
proceeding in any such jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall limit the right of any
Lender to bring proceedings against the Borrower and each of the other Credit
Parties in the court of any other jurisdiction.

11.15 Acknowledgements. Each of the Credit Parties hereby acknowledges
that:

(a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
delivery of each Credit Document;

(b) neither the Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary relationship
with or duty to the Credit Parties arising out of or in connection with
this Credit Agreement and the relationship between Agent and Lenders, on
one hand, and the Credit Parties, on the other hand, in connection herewith
is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

(c) no joint venture exists among the Lenders or among the Credit
Parties and the Lenders.

11.16 Waivers of Jury Trial. THE CREDIT PARTIES, THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS
CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

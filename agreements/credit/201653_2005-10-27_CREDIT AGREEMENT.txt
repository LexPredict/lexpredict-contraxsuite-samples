Loans, maturing on the last day of the Revolving Commitment Period, by means
of any combination of Base Rate Loans and/or LIBOR Loans.

(d) At the request of Borrower, subject to the notice and other
provisions of Section 2.2, Lender shall convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR
Loans at any time and shall convert LIBOR Loans to Base Rate Loans on any
Interest Adjustment Date.

(e) The obligation of Borrower to repay the Base Rate Loans and LIBOR
Loans made by Lender and to pay interest thereon shall be evidenced by a
Revolving Credit Note of Borrower in the form of Exhibit A.  Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, Borrower shall be entitled under this Section
2.1 to borrow funds, repay the same in whole or in part and re-borrow
hereunder at any time and from time to time during the Revolving Commitment
Period.

SECTION 2.2. Conditions to Loans.  The obligation of Lender to make a
Loan or to convert a LIBOR Loan or Base Rate Loan is conditioned, in the case
of each borrowing, conversion or continuation hereunder, upon:

(a) all conditions precedent as listed in Article IV shall have been
satisfied;

(b) receipt by Lender of a Notice of Loan, such notice to be received by
11:00 A.M. (Cleveland, Ohio time), (i) with respect to Base Rate Loans, on
the proposed date of borrowing or

<PAGE>                                13

conversion, and, (ii) with respect to LIBOR Loans, three Business Days prior
to the proposed date of borrowing, conversion or continuation;

(c) Borrower's request for a  Base Rate Loan shall be in an amount of
not less than $500,000 and increased by increments of $100,000 thereafter and
LIBOR Loan shall be in an amount of not less than $1,000,000 and increased by
increments of $500,000 thereafter;

(d) the fact that no Default or Event of Default shall then exist or
immediately after the making, conversion or continuation of such Loan would
exist;

(e) the fact that each of the representations and warranties contained
in Article VII shall be true and correct in all material respects (provided
that if any such representation or warranty contains any materiality
qualifier, such representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all
respects) with the same force and effect as if made on and as of the date of
the making, conversion or continuation of such Loan, except to the extent
that any thereof expressly relate to an earlier date; and

(f) at no time shall Borrower request that LIBOR Loans be outstanding
for more than five different Interest Periods at any time.

Each request by Borrower for the making of a Loan or conversion of a
LIBOR Loan or Base Rate Loan shall be deemed to be a representation and
warranty by Borrower as of the date of such request as to the facts specified
in clauses (d) and (e) above.

Each request for a LIBOR Loan shall be irrevocable and binding on
Borrower and Borrower shall indemnify Lender against any loss or reasonable
expense incurred by Lender as a result of any failure by Borrower to
consummate such transaction including, without limitation, any loss
(including loss of anticipated profits) or reasonable expense incurred by
reason of liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by
Lender to fund such LIBOR Loan, which losses shall be calculated by Lender in
a manner consistent with Section 2.4(b).  A certificate as to the amount of
such loss or expense submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

thereof and the applicable dates with respect thereto, by such method as
Lender may generally employ; provided, however, that failure to make any such
entry shall in no way detract from Borrower's obligations under the Note.
The aggregate unpaid amount of Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans set forth on
the records of Lender shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the
principal and interest owing and unpaid on the Note.  Whenever any payment to
be made hereunder, including, without limitation, any payment to be made on
the Note, shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension
of time shall in each case be included in the computation of the interest
payable on each Note; provided, however, that, with respect to any LIBOR
Loan, if the next succeeding Business Day falls in the succeeding calendar
month, such payment shall be made on the preceding Business Day and the
relevant Interest Period shall be adjusted accordingly.

SECTION 2.4. Prepayment.   Borrower has the right at any time or from
time to time to prepay all or any part of the principal amount of the Note
then outstanding, as designated by Borrower, plus interest accrued on the
amount so prepaid to the date of such prepayment. Borrower shall give Lender
notice of prepayment of any Base Rate Loan by not later than 11:00 A.M.

premium or penalty, other than any prepayment fees, penalties or other
charges that may be contained in any Hedge Agreement.

(b) In any case of prepayment of a LIBOR Loan, Borrower agrees that if
the LIBO Rate as determined as of 11:00 A.M. (London time), three Business
Days prior to the date of prepayment of such LIBOR Loan (hereinafter,
"Prepayment LIBOR") shall be lower than the last LIBO Rate previously
determined for such LIBOR Loan with respect to which prepayment is intended
to be made (hereinafter, "Last LIBOR"), then Borrower shall, upon written
notice by Lender, promptly pay to Lender in immediately available funds, a
prepayment fee equal to the product of (a) a rate (the "Prepayment Rate")
that shall be equal to the difference between the Last LIBOR and the
Prepayment LIBOR, times (b) all or such part of the principal amounts of the
Note as relate to the LIBOR Loan to be prepaid, times (c) the number of days
in the period commencing with the date on which such prepayment is to be made
to that date that coincides with the last day of the Interest Period
previously established when the LIBOR Loan, that is to be prepaid, was made.
In addition, Borrower shall immediately pay directly to Lender, the amount
claimed as additional costs or reasonable expenses (including, without
limitation, cost of facsimile or telex transmission, wires, or cables)
incurred in connection with the prepayment, upon Borrower's receipt of a
written statement from Lender. Each prepayment of a LIBOR Loan shall be in
the aggregate principal sum of not less than $500,000.

equal to 0.50% times the Unused Total Revolving Commitment in effect on such
day. The accrued Commitment Fee shall be payable in arrears on the last
Business Day of each December, March, June and September and on the last day
of the Revolving Commitment Period.

(b) Reduction of Revolving Commitment.  Borrower may at any time or from
time to time permanently reduce in whole or ratably in part the Revolving
Commitment to an amount not less than the existing Revolving Credit Exposure,
by giving Lender not fewer than three Business Days' prior written notice of
such reduction, provided that any such partial reduction shall be in an
amount of not less than $5,000,000.  After each such reduction, the
Commitment Fees payable hereunder shall be calculated upon the Revolving
Commitment as so reduced. Any partial reduction in the Revolving Commitment
shall be effective during the remainder of the Revolving Commitment Period.

SECTION 2.6. Computation of Interest and Fees; Default Rate.  Interest
on Loans, Related Expenses, Commitment Fees and other fees and charges
hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year having 360 days and
calculated for the actual number of days elapsed.  Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if an Event of Default shall occur hereunder, the
principal of each Note and the unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest,
until paid, at the Default Rate.  In no event shall the rate of interest
hereunder exceed the maximum rate allowable by law.

SECTION 2.7. Mandatory Payment.  If the Revolving Credit Exposure at any
time exceeds the Total Commitment Amount then in effect, Borrower shall, as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day,
prepay an aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans sufficient to
reduce the Revolving Credit Exposure to an amount that is equal to or less
than the Total Commitment Amount.  Any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan pursuant to
this Section 2.7 shall be subject to the prepayment fees set forth in Section
2.4.

ARTICLE III.   ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO LIBOR LOANS;
INCREASED CAPITAL; TAXES

SECTION 3.1. Reserves or Deposit Requirements, Etc.  If, at any time,
any law, treaty or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation D of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or the interpretation
thereof by any governmental authority charged with the administration thereof
or any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority shall impose
(whether or not having the force of law), modify or deem applicable any
reserve and/or special deposit requirement (other than reserves included in
the reserve percentage, the effect of which is reflected in the interest
rate(s) of the LIBOR Loan(s) in question) against assets held by, or deposits
in or for the amount of any LIBOR Loan by, Lender, and the result of the
foregoing is to increase the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a
cost) to Lender of making or maintaining hereunder such LIBOR Loan or to
reduce the amount of principal or interest received by Lender with respect to
such LIBOR Loan, then, upon demand by Lender, Borrower shall pay to Lender
from time to time on Interest Adjustment Dates with respect to such LIBOR
Loan, as additional consideration hereunder, additional amounts sufficient to
fully compensate and indemnify Lender for such increased cost or reduced
amount, provided such additional cost or reduced amount was allocable to such
LIBOR Loan.  A certificate as to the increased cost or reduced amount as a
result of any event mentioned in this Section 3.1, setting forth the
calculations therefor, shall be promptly submitted by Lender to Borrower and
shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the
amount thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, after
any such demand for compensation by Lender, Borrower, upon at least three
Business Days' prior written notice to Lender, may prepay any affected LIBOR
Loan in full or convert such LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate Loan regardless of the
Interest Period thereof. Any such prepayment or conversion shall be subject
to the prepayment fees set forth in Section 2.4. Lender shall notify Borrower
as promptly as practicable of the existence of any event that will likely
require the payment by Borrower of any such additional amount under this
Section.

SECTION 3.2. Tax Law, Etc.  (a) In the event that by reason of any law,
regulation or requirement or in the interpretation thereof by an official
authority, or the imposition of any requirement of any central Lender whether
or not having the force of law, Lender shall, with respect to this Agreement
or any transaction under this Agreement, be subjected to any tax, levy,
impost, charge, fee, duty, deduction or withholding of any kind whatsoever
(other than any tax imposed upon the total net income of Lender) and if any
such measures or any other similar measure shall result in an increase in the
cost to Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or in a reduction in
the amount of principal, interest or commitment fee receivable by Lender in
respect thereof, then Lender shall promptly notify Borrower stating the
reasons therefor. Borrower shall thereafter pay to Lender, upon demand from
time to time on Interest Adjustment Dates with respect to such LIBOR Loan, as
additional consideration hereunder, such additional amounts as shall fully
compensate Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount. A certificate as
to any such increased cost or reduced amount, setting forth the calculations
therefor, shall be submitted by Lender to Borrower and shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof.

(b) If Lender receives such additional consideration from Borrower
pursuant to this Section 3.2, Lender shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
the benefits of any refund, deduction or credit for any taxes or other
amounts on account of which such additional consideration has been paid and
shall reimburse Borrower to the extent, but only to the extent, that Lender
shall receive an actual refund of such taxes or other amounts together with
any interest thereon or an effective net reduction in taxes or other
governmental charges (including any taxes imposed on or measured by the total
net income of Lender) of the United States or any state or subdivision
thereof by virtue of any such deduction or credit, after first giving effect
to all other deductions and credits otherwise available to Lender. If, at the
time any audit of Lender's income tax return is completed, Lender determines,
based on such audit, that it was not entitled to the full amount of any
refund reimbursed to Borrower as aforesaid or that its net income taxes are
or

<PAGE>                                16

were not reduced by a credit or deduction for the full amount of taxes
reimbursed to Borrower as aforesaid, Borrower, upon demand of Lender, shall
promptly pay to Lender the amount so refunded to which Lender was not so
entitled, or the amount by which the net income taxes of Lender were not so
reduced, as the case may be.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, after any
such demand for compensation by Lender, Borrower, upon at least three
Business Days' prior written notice to Lender, may prepay any affected LIBOR
Loan in full or convert such LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate Loan regardless of the
Interest Period of any thereof. Any such prepayment or conversion shall be
subject to the prepayment fees set forth in Section 2.4.

SECTION 3.3. Eurodollar Deposits Unavailable or Interest Rate
Unascertainable.  In respect of any LIBOR Loan, in the event that Lender has
determined that dollar deposits of the relevant amount for the relevant
Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan is not available to Lender in the
applicable eurodollar market or that, by reason of circumstances affecting
such market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
LIBO Rate applicable to such Interest Period, as the case may be, Lender
shall promptly give notice of such determination to Borrower and (a) any
notice of a new LIBOR Loan (or conversion of an existing Loan to a LIBOR
Loan) previously given by Borrower and not yet borrowed (or converted, as the
case may be) shall be deemed a notice to make a Base Rate Loan, and (b)
Borrower shall be obligated either to prepay, or to convert to a Base Rate
Loan, any outstanding LIBOR Loan on the last day of the then current Interest
Period with respect thereto.

SECTION 3.4. Indemnity.  Without prejudice to any other provisions of
this Article III, Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Lender against any loss
or expense that Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of any default
by Borrower in payment when due of any amount hereunder in respect of any
LIBOR Loan, including, but not limited to, any loss of profit, premium or
penalty incurred by Lender in respect of funds borrowed by it for the purpose
of making or maintaining such LIBOR Loan, as determined by Lender in the
exercise of its sole discretion. A certificate as to any such loss or expense
shall be promptly submitted by Lender to Borrower and shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof.

SECTION 3.5. Changes in Law Rendering LIBOR Loans Unlawful.  If at any
time any new law, treaty or regulation, or any change in any existing law,
treaty or regulation, or any interpretation thereof by any governmental or
other regulatory authority charged with the administration thereof, shall
make it unlawful for Lender to fund any LIBOR Loan that it is committed to
make hereunder with moneys obtained in the eurodollar market, the commitment
of Lender to fund such LIBOR Loan shall, upon the happening of such event
forthwith be suspended for the duration of such illegality, and Lender shall
by written notice to Borrower declare that its commitment with respect to
such LIBOR Loan has been so suspended and, if and when such illegality ceases
to exist, such suspension shall cease and Lender shall similarly notify
Borrower.  If any such change shall make it unlawful for Lender to continue
in effect the funding in the applicable eurodollar market of any LIBOR Loan
previously made by it hereunder, Lender shall, upon the happening of such
event, notify Borrower thereof in writing stating the reasons therefor, and
Borrower shall, on the earlier of (a) the last day of the then current
Interest Period or (b) if required by such law, regulation or interpretation,
on such date as shall be specified in such notice, either convert such LIBOR
Loan to a Base Rate Loan or prepay such LIBOR Loan in full. Any such
prepayment or conversion shall be subject to the prepayment fees described in
Section 2.4.

SECTION 3.6. Funding.  Lender may, but shall not be required to, make
LIBOR Loans hereunder with funds obtained outside of the United States.

SECTION 3.7. Capital Adequacy.  If Lender has determined, after the
Closing Date, that the adoption of any applicable law, rule, regulation or
guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change

<PAGE>                                17

in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation
or administration thereof, or compliance by Lender (or its lending office)
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
Lender's capital (or the capital of its holding company) as a consequence of
its obligations hereunder to a level below that which Lender (or its holding
company) could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance
(taking into consideration Lender's policies or the policies of its holding
company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Lender to be
material, then from time to time, within 10 days after demand by Lender,
Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate Lender (or its holding company) for such reduction. Lender shall
designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need
for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment
of Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to Lender. A certificate of Lender
claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional
amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, Lender may use any
reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Failure on the part of Lender
to demand compensation for any reduction in return on capital with respect to
any period shall not constitute a waiver of Lender's rights to demand
compensation for any reduction in return on capital in such period or in any
other period. The protection of this Section shall be available to Lender
regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of
the law, regulation or other condition that shall have been imposed.

reasonable extent as Lender may request.

SECTION 5.5. Franchises.  Except as permitted by Section 6.6, Borrower
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, preserve and maintain at
all times its existence, rights and franchises.

SECTION 5.6. Environmental Compliance.  Borrower shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, comply in all respects with any and all
Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws in
jurisdictions in which any Company owns or operates a facility or site,
arranges for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, solid waste or
other wastes, accepts for transport any hazardous substances, solid waste or
other wastes or holds any interest in real property or otherwise. Borrower
shall furnish to Lender, promptly after receipt thereof, a copy of any notice
any Company may receive from any governmental authority or private Person or
otherwise that any material litigation or proceeding pertaining to any
environmental, health or safety matter has been filed or is threatened
against such Company, any real property in which such Company holds any
interest or any past or present operation of such Company. No Company shall
allow the release or disposal of hazardous waste, solid waste or other wastes
on, under or to any real property in which any Company holds any interest or
performs any of its operations, in violation of any Environmental Law.  As
used in this Section 5.7, "litigation or proceeding" means any demand, claim,
notice, suit, suit in equity action, administrative action, investigation or
inquiry whether brought by any governmental authority or private Person or
otherwise. Borrower shall defend, indemnify and hold Lender harmless against
all costs, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and reasonable expenses of
every kind or nature whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
arising out of or resulting from the noncompliance of any Company with any
Environmental Law.  Such indemnification shall survive any termination of
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.7. Use of Proceeds.  Borrower's use of the proceeds of the
Revolving Credit Note shall be solely for refinancing of existing
indebtedness, for working capital needs and for other general corporate
purposes of Borrower.

SECTION 5.8. Guaranties and Pledge Agreement.

(a) Each Domestic Subsidiary that is wholly-owned (directly or
indirectly) by Borrower which is created, acquired or held on or subsequent
to the Closing Date shall immediately become a party to the Closing Date
Guaranty or execute a separate Guaranty and shall deliver such corporate
governance and authorization documents and an opinion of counsel as may be
deemed necessary or advisable by Lender; provided, however, that no Dissolved
Subsidiary shall be required to become a party to the

<PAGE>                                22

Closing Date Guaranty or execute a separate Guaranty so long as on or before
November 4, 2005, (i) the appropriate documents, including, without
limitation, a certificate or articles of dissolution, have been filed with
the appropriate governmental authorities to effect dissolution of such
Dissolved Subsidiary in accordance with applicable law and (ii) evidence
thereof acceptable to Lender shall have been delivered to Lender; provided
further that no revocation of any such dissolution shall occur or be
requested.

(b) If at any time all or a portion of the equity interests of a Credit
Party (other than Borrower) are sold or transferred in accordance with this
Agreement, Borrower or such Credit Party shall deliver notice to Lender of
such sale or transfer and request that such Credit Party be released from its
obligations under the Guaranty to which it is a party. Upon receipt of such
notice by Lender, Lender shall promptly release such Credit Party from its
obligations under such Guaranty and, if requested by Borrower or such Credit
Party, shall execute and deliver to Borrower and such Credit Party written
confirmation thereof, all at the reasonable expense of Borrower and/or such
Credit Party. From and after release, such released Credit Party shall no
longer be deemed a Guarantor or Credit Party under any of the Loan Documents.

(c) If any Credit Party forms or acquires a Subsidiary on or after the
Closing Date, such Credit Party shall execute and deliver to Lender such
pledge agreements and take such other actions (including delivering the
certificates representing such shares of stock or other equity interests to
Lender) as shall be necessary to create and perfect valid and enforceable
first priority Liens in favor of Lender on all of the issued and outstanding
stock or other equity interests (or, in the case of any "controlled foreign
corporation," as defined in Section 957 of the Code, no more than 662/3% of
the issued and outstanding voting stock or other equity interests) of such
newly formed or acquired Subsidiary owned by such Credit Party, all of the
foregoing to be in form and substance satisfactory to Lender.

SECTION 5.9. Good Repair.  Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, ensure that its material properties and equipment used or
useful in its business in whomsoever's possession they may be, are kept in
good repair, working order and condition, normal wear and tear excepted, and
that from time to time there are made in such properties and equipment all
needful and proper repairs, renewals, replacements, extensions, additions,
betterments and improvements thereto, to the extent and in the manner
customary for companies in similar businesses.

SECTION 5.10. Compliance with Statutes, etc.  Borrower shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable statutes,
regulations and orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by, all
governmental authorities in respect of the conduct of its business and the
ownership of its property, other than those the noncompliance with which
would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 5.11. Further Assurances.  Borrower shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to Lender such documents, agreements and instruments, and will
take or cause to be taken such further actions that may be required by law or
that Lender may from time to time reasonably request to carry out the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to ensure
perfection and priority of the Liens created or intended to be created by the
Security Documents, all at the reasonable expense of Borrower.

ARTICLE VI.   NEGATIVE COVENANTS

(iii) when added together with the aggregate consideration for all other
Asset Sales permitted under this subpart (c), does not exceed $1,000,000;

permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any transaction or series of
transactions with any Affiliate other than in the ordinary course of business
of and pursuant to the reasonable requirements of Borrower's or such
Subsidiary's business and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to
Borrower or such Subsidiary than would be obtained in a comparable arm's-
length transaction with a Person other than an Affiliate, except (a)
transactions between or among Credit Parties in the ordinary course of
business; and (b) transactions between or among Subsidiaries that are not
Credit Parties in the ordinary course of business.

SECTION 6.8. ERISA Compliance.  Borrower shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, incur any material accumulated funding deficiency
within the meaning of ERISA, or any material liability to the PBGC,
established thereunder in connection with any ERISA Plan. Borrower shall
furnish to Lender (a) as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days
after any Company knows or has reason to know that any Reportable Event with
respect to any ERISA Plan has occurred, a statement of a Financial Officer of
such Company, setting forth details as to such Reportable Event and the
action that such Company proposes to take with respect thereto, together with
a copy of the notice of such Reportable Event given to the PBGC if a copy of
such notice is available to such Company, and (b) promptly after receipt
thereof, a copy of any notice such Company, or any member of the Controlled
Group may receive from the PBGC or the Internal Revenue Service with respect
to any ERISA Plan administered by such Company; provided that this latter
clause shall not apply to notices of general application promulgated by the
PBGC or the Internal Revenue Service.  Borrower shall promptly notify Lender
of any material taxes assessed, proposed to be assessed or which Borrower has
reason to believe may be assessed against a Company by the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to any ERISA Plan.  As used in this Section 6.7
"material" means the measure of a matter of significance that shall be
determined as being an amount equal to 5% of the Consolidated Net Worth of
Borrower.  As soon as practicable, and in any event within 20 days, after any
Company becomes aware that an ERISA Event has occurred, such Company shall
provide Lender with notice of such ERISA Event with a certificate by a
Financial Officer of such Company setting forth the details of the event and
the action such Company or another Controlled Group member proposes to take
with respect thereto.  Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, deliver or
cause to

<PAGE>                                27

be delivered to Lender true and correct copies of any document relating to
the ERISA Plan of any Company.

SECTION 6.9. Regulations U and X.  Borrower shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action that would result in any
non-compliance of the Loans with Regulations U and X, or any other
regulation, of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

SECTION 6.10. Amendment of Material Documents.  Borrower shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, modify or waive any of
its rights under (a) any agreement relating to any Subordinated Indebtedness
or Material Indebtedness; (b) its Organizational Documents; or (c) contracts,
agreements or arrangements to which such Company is party and which are
material to the operation or conduct of its business, in each case, to the
extent any such amendment, modification or waiver would be adverse to the
Lender in any material respect relating to this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

SECTION 6.11. Patriot Act; FCPA.  Borrower shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, comply in all material respects with the Patriot Act at all
times from and after the date of this Agreement.  No part of the proceeds of
the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, for any payments to any
governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political
party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official
capacity, in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any
improper advantage, in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended

SECTION 6.12. Restrictive Agreements.  Borrower shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into, incur
or permit to exist any contract, agreement or other arrangement that
prohibits, restricts or imposes any condition upon the ability of (a)
Borrower or such Subsidiary to create, incur or permit to exist any Lien upon
any of its property or assets or (b) any Subsidiary to pay dividends or other
distributions, including, without limitation, Capital Distributions with
respect to any shares of its issued and outstanding equity interests or to
make or repay loans or advances to any Company, or to guarantee Indebtedness
of any Company; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to (i)
restrictions and conditions imposed by law or by any Loan Document; or (ii)
customary restrictions and conditions contained in agreements relating to the
sale of a Subsidiary pending such sale, provided such restrictions and
conditions apply only to the Subsidiary that is to be sold and such sale is
permitted hereunder.  Clause (a) of the foregoing shall not apply to (i)
restrictions or conditions imposed by any agreement relating to secured
Indebtedness permitted by this Agreement if such restrictions or conditions
apply only to the property or assets securing such Indebtedness; or (ii)
customary provisions in leases and other contracts restricting the assignment
thereof.

ARTICLE VII.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Borrower hereby makes the following representations and warranties:

SECTION 7.1. Corporate Existence; Subsidiaries; Foreign Qualification.

(a) Each Company is an entity duly organized, validly existing, and in
good standing under the laws of its state of organization and is duly
qualified and authorized to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
entity in each jurisdiction where the character of its property or its
business activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The following information is set forth on Schedule 7.1 as of the
Closing Date: (i) the state of organization of Borrower, (ii) each state or
other jurisdiction in which Borrower is qualified to do

<PAGE>                                28

business as a foreign corporation, (iii) each Subsidiary of Borrower and each
Subsidiary of each other Company, (iv) such Subsidiary's state or country of
organization, (v) each state or other jurisdiction in which each Closing Date
Guarantor is qualified to do business as a foreign entity, and (vi) the
direct or indirect ownership of Borrower in each of its Subsidiaries.  As of
the Closing Date, Borrower has no wholly-owned Subsidiary other than the
Closing Date Guarantors and the Dissolved Subsidiaries.

(c) No Subsidiary of Borrower that is not wholly-owned (directly or
indirectly) by Borrower owns any Subsidiary.

SECTION 7.2. Corporate Authority.  Each Credit Party has the right and
power and is duly authorized and empowered to enter into, execute and deliver
the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to perform and observe the
provisions of the Loan Documents.  The Loan Documents to which each Credit
Party is a party have been duly authorized and approved by such Credit
Party's Board of Directors and are the valid and binding obligations of such
Credit Party, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective
terms.  The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents will
not conflict with nor result in any breach in any of the provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than
Liens permitted under Section 6.3 of this Agreement) upon any assets or
property of any Credit Party under the provisions of such Credit Party's
Organizational Documents or any agreement.

SECTION 7.3. No Violation.  Neither the execution, delivery and
performance by any Credit Party of the Loan Documents to which it is party
nor compliance with the terms and provisions thereof (a) will contravene in
any material respect any provision of any law, statute, rule, regulation,
order, writ, injunction or decree of any governmental authority applicable to
such Credit Party or its properties and assets, (b) will conflict with or
result in any breach of, any of the terms, covenants, conditions or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or
imposition of (or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien (other than
the Liens created pursuant to the Security Documents) upon any of the
property or assets of such Credit Party pursuant to the terms of any
promissory note, bond, debenture, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit
or loan agreement, or any other agreement or other instrument, to which such
Credit Party is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets are
bound or to which it may be subject, or (c) will violate any provision of the
Organizational Documents of such Credit Party.

SECTION 7.4. Lawful Operations, etc.  Each Company (a) holds all
necessary foreign, federal, state, local and other governmental licenses,
registrations, certifications, permits and authorizations necessary to
conduct its business; and (b) is in compliance with all requirements imposed
by law, regulation or rule, whether foreign, federal, state or local, that
are applicable to it, its operations, or its properties and assets,
including, without limitation, applicable requirements of Environmental Laws,
except for any failure to obtain and maintain in effect, or noncompliance
that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 7.5. Litigation and Administrative Proceedings.  There are no
(a) lawsuits, actions, investigations, or other proceedings pending or
threatened against any Company, or in respect of which any Company may have
any liability, in any court or before any governmental authority, arbitration
board, or other tribunal, (b) orders, writs, injunctions, judgments, or
decrees of any court or government agency or instrumentality to which any
Company is a party or by which the property or assets of any Company are
bound, or (c) grievances, disputes, or controversies outstanding with any
union or other organization of the employees of any Company, or threats of
work stoppage, strike, or pending demands for collective bargaining, which,
in each case, have had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>                                29

SECTION 7.6. Title to Assets.  Each Company has good title to and
ownership of all property it owns or purports to own, which property is free
and clear of all Liens, except those permitted under Section 6.3.

SECTION 7.7. Liens and Security Interests.  On and after the Closing
Date, except for Liens permitted pursuant to Section 6.3, (a) there is no
financing statement outstanding covering any personal property of any
Company, other than a financing statement in favor of Lender; (b) there is no
mortgage outstanding covering any real property of any Company, other than a
mortgage in favor of Lender; and (c) no real or personal property of any
Company is subject to any security interest or Lien of any kind other than
any security interest or Lien that may be or has previously been granted to
Lender.  Lender has a valid and enforceable first priority security interest
in the Collateral.  No Company has entered into any contract or agreement
that exists on or after the Closing Date that would prohibit Lender from
acquiring a security interest, mortgage or other Lien on, or a collateral
assignment of, any of the property or assets of any Company.

SECTION 7.8. Tax Returns.  All federal, state and local tax returns and
other reports required by law to be filed in respect of the income, business,
properties and employees of each Company have been filed and all taxes,
assessments, fees and other governmental charges that are due and payable
have been paid, except as otherwise permitted herein or the failure to do so
does not and will not cause or result in a Material Adverse Effect.  The
provision for taxes on the books of each Company is adequate for all years
not closed by applicable statutes and for the current fiscal year.

SECTION 7.9. Environmental Laws.  Each Company is in compliance with any
and all Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, all Environmental
Laws in all jurisdictions in which any Company owns or operates, or has owned
or operated, a facility or site, arranges or has arranged for disposal or
treatment of hazardous substances, solid waste or other wastes, accepts or
has accepted for transport any hazardous substances, solid waste or other
wastes or holds or has held any interest in real property or otherwise,
except to the extent that any such failure to comply has not had, or could
not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. No litigation
or proceeding arising under, relating to or in connection with any
Environmental Law is pending or, to the best knowledge of each Company,
threatened, against any Company, any real property in which any Company holds
or has held an interest or any past or present operation of any Company.  No
release, threatened release or disposal of hazardous waste, solid waste or
other wastes is occurring, or has occurred (other than those that are
currently being cleaned up in accordance with Environmental Laws), on, under
or to any real property in which any Company holds any interest or performs
any of its operations, in violation of any Environmental Law, except to the
extent of any such release, threatened release or disposal that has not had,
or could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. As
used in this Section 7.9, "litigation or proceeding" means any demand, claim,
notice, suit, suit in equity, action, administrative action, investigation or
inquiry whether brought by any governmental authority or private Person or
otherwise.

SECTION 7.10. Continued Business.  There exists no actual, pending, or,
to Borrower's knowledge, threatened termination, cancellation or limitation
of, or any modification or change in the business relationship of any Company
and any customer or supplier, or any group of customers or suppliers, whose
purchases or supplies, individually or in the aggregate, are material to the
business of any Company, and there exists no present condition or state of
facts or circumstances that would materially affect adversely any Company in
any respect or prevent a Company from conducting such business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in substantially the same manner
in which it was previously conducted.

SECTION 7.11. Employee Benefits Plans.  No ERISA Event has occurred or
is expected to occur with respect to an ERISA Plan.  Full payment has been
made of all amounts which a Controlled

<PAGE>                                30

Group member is required, under applicable law or under the governing
documents, to have been paid as a contribution to or a benefit under each
ERISA Plan.  The liability of each Controlled Group member with respect to
each ERISA Plan has been fully funded based upon reasonable and proper
actuarial assumptions, has been fully insured, or has been fully reserved for
on its financial statements.  No changes have occurred or are expected to
occur that would cause a material increase in the cost of providing benefits
under the ERISA Plan.  With respect to each ERISA Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Code Section 401(a), (a) the ERISA Plan and any associated
trust operationally comply with the applicable requirements of Code Section
401(a); (b) the ERISA Plan and any associated trust have been amended to
comply with all such requirements as currently in effect, other than those
requirements for which a retroactive amendment can be made within the
"remedial amendment period" available under Code Section 401(b) (as extended
under Treasury Regulations and other Treasury pronouncements upon which
taxpayers may rely); (c) the ERISA Plan and any associated trust have
received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
stating that the ERISA Plan qualifies under Code Section 401(a), that the
associated trust qualifies under Code Section 501(a) and, if applicable, that
any cash or deferred arrangement under the ERISA Plan qualifies under Code
Section 401(k), unless the ERISA Plan was first adopted at a time for which
the above-described "remedial amendment period" has not yet expired; (d) the
ERISA Plan currently satisfies the requirements of Code Section 410(b),
without regard to any retroactive amendment that may be made within the
above-described "remedial amendment period"; and (e) no contribution made to
the ERISA Plan is subject to an excise tax under Code Section 4972.  With
respect to any Pension Plan, the "accumulated benefit obligation" of
Controlled Group members with respect to the Pension Plan (as determined in
accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions") does not exceed the fair market value of pension
plan assets.  A Material Adverse Effect would not occur if all Controlled
Group members withdrew from all Multiemployer Plans in a "complete
withdrawal" (within the meaning of ERISA Section 4203).

SECTION 7.12. Consents or Approvals.  No consent, approval or
authorization of, or filing (except for the filing of financing statements
required to perfect Lender's security interest in the Collateral),
registration or qualification with, any governmental authority or any other
Person is required to be obtained or completed by any Company in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance of any of the Loan Documents,
that has not already been obtained or completed.

SECTION 7.13. Solvency.  Borrower has received consideration that is the
reasonable equivalent value of the obligations and liabilities that Borrower
has incurred to Lender. Borrower is not insolvent as defined in any
applicable state or federal statute, nor will Borrower be rendered insolvent
by the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents to Lender. Borrower is
not engaged or about to engage in any business or transaction for which the
assets retained by it will be an unreasonably small amount of capital, taking
into consideration the obligations to Lender incurred hereunder. Borrower
does not intend to, nor does it believe that it will, incur debts beyond its
ability to pay such debts as they mature.

SECTION 7.14. No Material Adverse Change.  Since December 31, 2004,
there has been no change in the condition, business, affairs or prospects of
Borrower or Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or their
properties and assets considered as an entirety, except for changes none of
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 7.15. Financial Statements.  The Consolidated financial
statements of Borrower for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, and the
interim Consolidated financial statements of Borrower for the fiscal quarters
ended March 31, 2005, and June 30, 2005, furnished to Lender, are true and
complete, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present the
Companies' financial condition as of the dates of such financial statements
and the results of their operations for the periods then

<PAGE>                                31

ended.  Since the dates of such statements, there has been no material
adverse change in any Companies' financial condition, properties or business
nor any change in any Company's accounting procedures.

SECTION 7.16. Regulations.  No Company is engaged principally, or as one
of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" (within the meaning of
Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the
United States of America).  Neither the granting of any Loan (or any
conversion thereof) nor the use of the proceeds of any Loan will violate, or
be inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation U or X of said Board of
Governors.

SECTION 7.17. Material Agreements.  Except as set forth on Schedule
7.17, no Company is a party to any (a) debt instrument; (b) lease (capital,
operating or otherwise), whether as lessee or lessor thereunder; (c)
contract, commitment, agreement, or other arrangement involving the purchase
or sale of any inventory by it, or the license of any right to or by it; (d)
contract, commitment, agreement, or other arrangement with any of its
"Affiliates" (as such term is defined in the 1934 Act); (e) management or

Section 2.  THE LOAN.  Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Bank will make the Loan described in this Section to the Company.









6













a.      The Revolving Loan.  The Bank will make a revolving loan to the Company on the following terms and subject to the following conditions:





(i)

The Commitment -- Use of Proceeds.  From this date and until the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, the Bank agrees to make Advances (collectively, the “Revolving Loan”) under a revolving line of credit from time to time to the Company of amounts not exceeding in the aggregate at any time outstanding the sum of Twenty Million
and 00/100 Dollars ($20,000,000.00).  Proceeds of the Revolving Loan may be used by the Company only for working capital and general corporate purposes.








(ii)

Method of Borrowing.  The obligation of the Company to repay the Revolving Loan shall be evidenced by a Promissory Note (the “Revolving Note”) of the Company in the form of Exhibit “B” attached hereto.  So long as no Event of Default or
Unmatured Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and until the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, the Company may borrow, repay (subject to the requirements of Section 2(b)(i)) and reborrow under the Revolving Note on any Banking Day; provided, that no borrowing may cause the principal balance of the Loan to exceed the Commitment or may result in an Event of Default or an Unmatured Event of Default.  The Company shall give the Bank written notice (effective upon receipt) of the Company’s
intent to draw down an Advance under this Agreement no later than 11:00 a.m. Indianapolis, Indiana time, not less than one (1) Banking Day before disbursement. The Company’s notice must specify: (A) the disbursement date, and (B) the amount of each Advance. There shall be  no minimum amount of any Advance. All requests for an Advance shall be requests for LIBOR Rate Advances. All notices under this Section 2(a)(ii) are irrevocable. By the Bank's close of business on the disbursement date and upon
fulfillment of the conditions set forth herein and in any other of the Loan Documents, the Bank shall disburse the requested Advances in immediately available funds by crediting the amount of such Advances to the Company's account with the Bank. All Advances by the Bank and payments by the Company shall be recorded by the Bank on its books and records, and the principal amount outstanding from time to time, plus interest payable thereon, shall












7

















be determined by reference to the books and records of the Bank.  The Bank's books and records shall be presumed prima facie to be correct as to such matters.  Upon receipt of the written request of the Company from time to time but not more frequently than once
each fiscal quarter, the Bank shall provide to the Company written reports on outstanding principal plus accrued interest paid to-date.








(iii)

Interest on the Revolving Loan.  Except as otherwise provided below in this Section 2(a)(iii), all Advances disbursed under the Revolving Loan shall accrue interest at the LIBOR-based Rate which initially shall be determined as of the date of the initial Advance and re-determined on each London Business Day thereafter.  Accrued
interest shall be due and payable on the last Banking Day of each calendar month beginning on the last Banking Day of September, 2009. After maturity, whether on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date or on account of acceleration upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and until paid in full, all Advances under the Revolving Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to three percent (3%) above the otherwise applicable rate of interest, and shall be payable as accrued and without demand. At any time the
LIBOR-based Rate is unavailable for any of the reasons set forth in Section 2(b)(i) herein, prior to maturity, then the applicable rate of interest under the Revolving Loan prior to maturity shall be the sum of the Prime Rate plus one percent (1%) per annum.








(iv)

Unused Fee.  The Company  shall pay to the Bank a facility  or unused fee for each partial or full calendar quarter during which the Commitment is outstanding equal to ten (10) Basis Points per annum of the average daily excess of the Commitment over the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan.  Unused
fees for each calendar quarter shall be due and payable within ten (10) days following the Bank's submission of a statement of the amount due.  Such fees may be debited by the Bank when due to any demand deposit account of the Company carried with the Bank without further authority.  The unused fee shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed.








(v)

Payments of Principal.  The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the












8

















Revolving Loan shall be due and payable in full on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date.








b.

Provisions Applicable to the Loan.  The following provisions are applicable to the Loan:








(i)

The LIBOR-based Rate -- Certain Effects. The LIBOR-based Rate shall be subject to the following conditions in addition to other consequences stated in this Agreement:








A.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Bank may elect not to offer the LIBOR-based Rate on any day on which the Bank has determined that it is not practical to quote such rate because of the unavailability of sufficient funds to the Bank for appropriate terms at rates approximating the relevant London Interbank Offered Rate, or because of legal or regulatory changes which make it impractical
or burdensome for the Bank to lend money at the LIBOR-based Rate.








B.

If, as a result of any regulatory change, the basis of taxation of payments to the Bank of the principal of or any interest on the Revolving Loan bearing interest at the  LIBOR-based Rate or any other amounts payable hereunder in respect thereof, other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of the Bank, is changed, or any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement relating to any extensions
of credit or other assets of or any deposits with or other liabilities of the Bank are imposed, modified, or deemed applicable, and the Bank reasonably determines that, by reason thereof, the cost to it of making, issuing, or maintaining the Revolving Loan at the LIBOR-based Rate is increased by an amount deemed by it to be material, then the Company shall pay promptly upon demand to the Bank such additional amounts as the Bank reasonably determines will compensate for such increased costs; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be the only borrower of the Bank that is singled out from a group of similarly situated borrowers of the Bank subject to this type of provision that is requested to remit increased costs.  Any determination by the












9

















Bank of increased costs of maintaining deposits made pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be final, absent manifest error.








(ii)

Calculation of Interest.  Interest on the Revolving Loan shall be calculated by applying the ratio of the annual interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding.








(iii)

Manner of Payment - Application.  All payments of principal and interest on the Loan shall be payable at the principal office of the Bank in Indianapolis, Indiana, in funds available for the Bank's immediate use in that city and no payment will be considered to have been made until received in such funds.  All payments received
on account of the Loan will be applied first to the satisfaction of any interest which is then due and payable, and to principal only after all interest which is due and payable has been satisfied.








(iv)

Commitment Fee.  The Bank acknowledges receipt from the Company of the sum of $5,000.00, either previous to or contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, as a fee for the Bank's commitment to make the Loans.








(v)

Automatic Debit.  After the occurrence of an Event of Default or an Unmatured Event of Default, the Bank may debit when due all payments of principal and interest due under the terms of this Agreement to any deposit account of the Company carried with the Bank without further authority.




Section 3.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  To induce the Bank to make the Loan, the Company represents and warrants to the Bank that:

USA PATRIOT ACT NOTIFICATION.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT.  To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person
or entity who opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. What this means for the Company is that when the Company opens an account, if the Company is not an individual, the Bank will ask for the Company's name, tax identification number, business address, and other information which will allow the Bank to identify the Company.  The Bank may also ask if the Company is not an individual, to see the
Company's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

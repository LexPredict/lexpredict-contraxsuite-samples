SECTION 2.01 Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth

conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow
Revolving Loans.

any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments and
Competitive Bids of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible
for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.

comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as the Borrower may request
in accordance herewith, and (ii) each Competitive Borrowing shall be comprised
entirely of Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans as the Borrower may request in
accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurodollar Loan by
causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such
Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation
of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000. At the time that
each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate

provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is
equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments. Each Competitive
Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and not less than $3,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and

2.05 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the

Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings which may not be converted or
continued.

(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a

Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent,
at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long
as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may
be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid,
each Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at
the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at

conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case
such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.
Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments.

SECTION 2.10 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of
each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the
Maturity Date and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
applicable Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan on
the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan.

(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

SECTION 2.11 Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part,
subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section;
provided that the Borrower shall not have the right to prepay any Competitive
Loan without the prior consent of the Lender thereof.

[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


(b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:30 a.m., New
York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the
case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:30 a.m., New
York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal
amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a
notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of
termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice
of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in
accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice
relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.
Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans
included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.

SECTION 2.12 Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent for account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the
Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether
used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such
Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment
terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount
of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which
its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases
to have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in
arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and
on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such
date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing
after the date on which the Commitments terminate, shall be payable on demand.
All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

(b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its
own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon
between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

(c) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in
the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid
shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

SECTION 2.13 Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

(b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Loan, the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the
Applicable Rate or (ii) in the case of



20
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect
for such Borrowing plus (or minus, as applicable) the Margin applicable to such
Loan.

(c) Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of
any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided above.

(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant
to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event
of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR
Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on
the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar
Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued
interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion
and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon termination of the
Commitments.

(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate,
Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent,
and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of
any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable,
for such Interest Period; or

(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders (or,
in the case of a Eurodollar Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required to
make such Loan) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for
such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included
in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders (or Lender) by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the
Lenders (or Lender) that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the


21
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving
Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing
Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made
as an ABR Borrowing and (iii) any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar
Competitive Borrowing shall be ineffective; provided that (A) if the
circumstances giving rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then
requests by the Borrower for Eurodollar Competitive Borrowings may be made to
Lenders that are not affected thereby and (B) if the circumstances giving rise
to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of
Borrowings shall be permitted.

SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any
other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate
Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any
sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional
costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital
requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as
a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made or Commitments held by, such
Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such
Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect
to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be,
as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than six months prior to the


22
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to
such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Lender
shall not be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section in respect of any
Competitive Loan if the Change in Law that would otherwise entitle it to such
compensation shall have been publicly announced prior to submission of the
Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Loan was made.

SECTION 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day
of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be
revocable under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith), (d) the
failure to borrow any Competitive Loan after accepting the Competitive Bid to
make such Loan, or (e) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or Fixed Rate Loan
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result
of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event,
the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the loss to any
Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount
determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount
of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal
amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion,
failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for
such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the
duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing,
conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were
equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount
of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period
if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the
interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender)
for dollar deposits from other banks in the eurodollar market at the
commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

SECTION 2.17 Taxes. Any and all payments by or an account of any obligation
of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction
for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the
case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and
(iii) the Borrower shall



23
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

(a) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section)
paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(d) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and
executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments
to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

SECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder
(whether of principal, interest or fees, or under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or
otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in
immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and
9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative
Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other
Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any
payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case
of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the
period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.



24
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and
fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest
and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and
(ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such
parties.

(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans resulting in such Lender receiving
payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans
and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender,
then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at
face value) participations in the Revolving Loans of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans; provided that (i) if any
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee
or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make
such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made
such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally
agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.06 or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in
its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such
Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

SECTION 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any
Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required
to pay any additional



25
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender
pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder
or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,
branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if
any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower
may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
(other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it) to an assignee that
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive
Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to
it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts)
and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

SECTION 2.20 New Lender. So long as no Default or Event of Default shall be
continuing, the Borrower, on at least five Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, may at any time increase the aggregate level of
Commitments hereunder up to $175,000,000 by causing one or more banks or
financial institutions (which may be an existing Lender), in each case
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, to execute and deliver an
instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (the "New Lender
Instrument") pursuant to which such Person(s) agree(s) to become a party hereto
as a Lender and which identifies such Person(s)' Commitment hereunder.
Commitments added pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall be in minimum amounts of
$5,000,000 and shall be in multiples thereof. If, at the time such Person
becomes a Lender hereunder there shall be outstanding any Revolving Loans, such
Person shall contemporaneously make available to the Administrative Agent a
Revolving Loan in an amount equal to its pro rata portion (based upon the
then-existing Commitments of all of the Lenders, including the New Lender) of
the aggregate principal amount of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and such
Revolving Loans made by such Person shall be applied by the Administrative Agent
to repay, in part, the Revolving Loans of the existing Lenders pro rata (based
on their


26
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


Revolving Loans principal balances); provided that no Commitment of a New Lender
shall be effective other than on the last day of any Interest Period.

(b) Except as disclosed in GATX Corporation's Form 8-K filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission dated April 23, 2002 and May 6, 2002 and
GATX Corporation's Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
dated May 15, 2002 (copies of which have been furnished to the Lenders), since

(b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to
use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual
property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and its

SECTION 3.06 Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

(b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any of

Liability.

(c) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in the

its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any
Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is

expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to
disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information
relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or
obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or
in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the
Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents
of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in
connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any
other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not


39
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice
of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York,
New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees
payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as
those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower
and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its
benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as Administrative Agent.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

SECTION 9.02 Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not
be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no
such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or
reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the
scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest
thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse
any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv)
change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing
of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, or (v)
change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "REQUIRED
LENDERS" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of
Lenders required to waive, amend or



41
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent.

SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower shall pay
(i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent
and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of
counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the
credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of
this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions
hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated) and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent, or any Lender (acting under common
counsel), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in
connection with the Loans made hereunder, including in connection with any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof.

(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person
being called an "INDEMNITEE") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from,
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including
the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred
by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as
a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their
respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any
other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds
therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous
Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether
any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required
to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such
Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not
assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special,



42
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan
or the use of the proceeds thereof.

(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after
written demand therefor.

SECTION 9.04 Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may
not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment
or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void).
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except
in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, each of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent must give their prior written consent to
such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except
in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or an assignment
of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount
of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$5,000,000, and the amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment shall not be
less than $5,000,000 after the effectiveness of such assignments, unless each of
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that this
clause (iii) shall not apply to rights in respect of outstanding Competitive
Loans, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire; provided further that any consent of the Borrower otherwise
required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph
(d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this


43
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (e) of this Section.

(c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary.

(d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

(e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.

(f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as
though it were a Lender. So long as a



44
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


Participant agrees, such Participant shall be bound by Section 2.19 as if it
were a Lender in each case thereunder.

(g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank,
and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security
interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest
shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

SECTION 9.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any
Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty
at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or
any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and
unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The
provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive
and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or
termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

SECTION 9.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest



45
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]


extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective
of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement
and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under
this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

SECTION 9.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the
law of the State of New York.

(b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States
District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New
York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

(c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in
paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

SECTION 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE


46
<PAGE>
[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]



BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 9.11 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

SECTION 9.12 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party
to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder
or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement
of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section, to any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement (provided that, in the case of an
assignee or Participant, or prospective assignee or Participant, which is a
competitor of the Borrower, the prior written consent of the Borrower shall be
required, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, prior to disclosing
the Information thereto), (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the
extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of
a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.
For the purposes of this Section, "INFORMATION" means all information received
from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower;
provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower after the
date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as
confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information.

SECTION 9.13 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such
Loan under applicable law (collectively the "CHARGES"), shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together



47

[Credit Agreement [Three Year]]



with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

Schedule 3.06
Disclosed Matters


The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Heartland Steel,
Inc., et al. v. Enron North America, John Hancock Mutual Life Ins, Ares
Leveraged Investment Fund, Mass. Mutual Life Insurance, Gerlach and Co., Inc.,
GATX Capital Corporation (the former name of the Borrower), Kavener Investments,
U.S., Inc., Kavener Corporate Development, Ltd., MacQuarie Infrastructure, Ltd.

This litigation is brought by the Official Creditors' Committee in the
pending Chapter 11 proceeding in regard to Heartland Steel, Inc. ("Heartland"),
against nine institutions that hold Heartland subordinated debt and/or stock.
The complaint seeks to equitably subordinate the claims of the defendants in
Heartland's bankruptcy and to recover $40 million of trade debt that was
allegedly incurred while Heartland was insolvent or under-capitalized. Heartland
was allegedly able to incur this debt due to actions of the defendants who
allegedly exercised control over Heartland. The Borrower became aware of this
claim on June 10, 2002. It has not had sufficient time to assess its actual
potential liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the following is
noted: the complaint alleges that the Board of Directors consisted of agents of
the defendants; however, GATX Capital Corporation, while a shareholder of
Heartland, did not have, nor did it exercise, any particular right to nominate
directors. The Borrower is one of nine defendants, all but one of which appear
able to meet their share of the potential liability, if any, under this claim.
Assuming that the plaintiffs are totally successful, the Borrower's share should
not be material.

In any event, the Borrower will vigorously defend itself against this
claim.

GATX Financial Corporation

July 2, 2002



To The Parties Listed on Schedule I Hereto

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to (i) the Credit Agreement [Three Year] dated as of
July 2, 2002 (the "2002 Credit Agreement") among GATX Financial Corporation (the
"Borrower"), the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as
administrative agent, (ii) the Credit Agreement [Three Year] dated as of June
22, 2001 (the "2001 Credit Agreement") among GATX Financial Corporation
(formerly known as GATX Capital Corporation), the lenders party thereto and
JPMorgan Chase Bank (as successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank), as
administrative agent, and (iii) the Credit Agreement dated as of May 14, 1998
(as amended through the date hereof, the "1998 Credit Agreement", and, together
with the 2002 Credit Agreement and the 2001 Credit Agreement, each individually
a "Credit Agreement" and collectively the "Credit Agreements") among the
Borrower (successor to General American Transportation Corporation), the banks
listed therein, Bank One N.A. (successor to The First National Bank of Chicago),
as administrative agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank (successor by merger to Morgan
Guaranty Trust Company of New York), as documentation agent. Unless otherwise
defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth or
incorporated in the 2002 Credit Agreement.

The Borrower hereby agrees that the loan pricing under each of the
2001 Credit Agreement and the 1998 Credit Agreement will increase to levels
comparable to those provided under the 2002 Credit Agreement so long as either
(x) the Borrower's Moody's Rating or S&P Rating on its Index Debt falls below
investment grade or (y) more than $50,000,000 of the commitments outstanding
under either the 1998 Credit Agreement or the 2001 Credit Agreement is borrowed
and any portion thereof in excess of $50,000,000 remains outstanding, and upon
the occurrence of any event described in clause (x) or (y) herein, the Borrower
shall provide notice thereof to the administrative agent under each of the 1998
Credit Agreement and the 2001 Credit Agreement. The Borrower agrees to execute
and deliver any documents necessary to effectuate such an increase.

</TABLE>

For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if either Moody's or S&P shall not
have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the
circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this definition), then such
rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in its lowest rating
category and (ii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established
by Moody's and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result
of a change in the rating system of Moody's or S&P), such change shall be
effective as of two Business Days after it is first announced by the applicable
rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during the period
commencing two Business Days after the effective date of such change and ending
on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If
the rating system of Moody's or S&P shall change, or if either such rating
agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations,
the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
definition to reflect such changed rating system and, in the case of the
unavailability of amendment, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by
reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or
cessation; provided, however, that the foregoing is subject to the following: in
order to qualify for a particular category of Applicable Margin or Facility Fee
either (x) each of the Moody's Rating and the S&P Rating required for that
category of Applicable Margin or Facility Fee must be attained or (y) if there
is a split rating (that is, if the two ratings fall within different
categories), the category will be determined based on the higher rating, with
pricing retroactive to the date when such difference occurred; provided,
however, that in the case of clause (y), if there is a difference of more than
one category gradation, the category will be determined based on the category
immediately below the higher rating.

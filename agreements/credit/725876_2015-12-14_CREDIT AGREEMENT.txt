ARTICLE 9


ILLEGALITY AND TAXES







9.1


Illegality










Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if on any date the Lender’s ability to maintain or continue to offer the Commitment or fund or hold the Loan has become unlawful or impossible because:







(a)


of any change in applicable Laws, or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction in the matter; or












(b)


the imposition of any condition, restriction or limitation upon such Lender which is outside of its control,










then the Lender shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, and the Borrower shall forthwith (or at the end of such period as is permitted under the applicable Law) repay to the Lender all principal amounts affected thereby, together with all unpaid interest accrued thereon to the date of repayment and all other expenses incurred in connection with the termination of the Loan.

9.3


Taxes












(a)


Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 9.3, the term “applicable Law” includes FATCA.












(b)


Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Loan Parties shall be required by applicable Law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) such Lender shall increase the sum payable as necessary so that after all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 9.3) the Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable Loan Parties shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable Loan Parties shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law.


















20























(c)


Payment of Other Taxes by Loan Parties. Without limiting the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law.












(d)


Indemnification by Borrower. Each Loan Party shall indemnify the Lender within ten (10) Business Days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 9.3) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Taxing Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by the Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error.












(e)


Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Taxing Authority, the relevant Loan Party shall deliver to the Lender the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Taxing Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.












(f)


Status of Lenders. (i) If the Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document, the Lender shall deliver to the Borrower, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, the Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will enable the Borrower to determine whether or not the Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject the Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the Lender.












(ii)


Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,












(A)


the Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower, whichever of the following is applicable:

Solely for purposes of this clause (C), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.


















22

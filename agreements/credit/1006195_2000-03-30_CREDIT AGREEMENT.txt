and/or expenses due under this Credit  Agreement by charging  Borrower's  demand

in the ordinary course of business in such account or accounts shall be evidence
of the  existence  and  amounts  of the  obligations  of  the  Borrower  therein
recorded.  The failure to record any such amount  shall not,  however,  limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower  hereunder to repay all amounts

days of the filing thereof;  or an order,  order for relief,  judgment or decree

authority  approving a petition or complaint seeking  reorganization of Borrower

deem necessary or appropriate, all of which remedies shall be deemed cumulative,
and not alternative:

accommodations in any form to or for the benefit of Borrower,

(ii) Declare the  principal of, and all interest then accrued on,

payable,  whereupon the same shall become  immediately due and payable
without presentment,  demand,  protest,  notice of default,  notice of
acceleration or of intention to accelerate or other notice of any kind
all of which Borrower  hereby  expressly  waives,  anything  contained
herein or in the Note to the contrary notwithstanding,

(iii) Reduce any claim to judgment, and/or

(iv) Without notice of default or demand,  pursue and enforce any
of  Lender'  rights  and  remedies  under  the  Credit  Documents,  or
otherwise  provided  under  or  pursuant  to  any  applicable  law  or
agreement;  provided,  however, that if any Event of Default specified
in Sections  9.1(g) and 9.1(h) shall occur,  the principal of, and all
interest on, the Note and other liabilities  hereunder shall thereupon
become due and  payable  concurrently  therewith,  without any further
action by Lender and without presentment,  demand,  protest, notice of
default, notice of acceleration or of intention to accelerate or other

Upon the  occurrence  and during the  continuance  of any Event of Default,
Lender is  hereby  authorized  at any time and from time to time,  with five (5)

other property of Borrower and the proceeds therefrom,  now or hereafter held or
received  by or in transit to Lender or its  agents,  from or for the account of
Borrower, whether for safe keeping, custody, pledge, transmission, collection or
otherwise,  and also upon any and all deposits  (general or special) and credits
of  Borrower,  and any and all  claims of  Borrower  against  Lender at any time
existing.  Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrower prior to and after any such
setoff and application,  provided that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such setoff and  application.  The rights of Lender under

without limitation, other rights of setoff) which Lender may have.

duty or agreement with respect to the pay ment of taxes,  obtaining  licenses or
permits,  or any other  requirement  contained  herein  or in any of the  Credit

failure,  Lender may, with five (5) days prior notice, at its option, perform or
attempt to perform such  covenant,  duty or agreement on behalf of Borrower . In
such event,  Borrower shall,  at the request of Lender,  promptly pay any amount
expended by Lender in such per  formance or attempted  performance  to Lender at
its office in  Inglewood,  California,  together  with  interest ther eon at the
Default Rate, from the date of such expenditure until paid.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is e xpressly understood that Lender does not assume any liability
or  responsibility  for the  performance of any duties of Borrower  hereunder or
under any of the Credit  Documents or other control over the  management and aff
airs of Borrower.

parties  hereto,  before or after  signing  this Credit  Agreement or any of the
other  Credit  Documents,  neither  this Credit  Agreement  nor any other Credit

against Lender, or any of its officers, directors, agents or employees, in favor
of any materialman, supplier, contractor, subcontractor,  purchaser or lessee of
any  property  owned by  Borrower,  nor to any other person or entity other than

controversy, dispute or claim exists), will be settled by a reference proceeding
in Los Angeles,  California, in accordance with the provisions of Section 638 et

law. The referee  shall (a) be  requested  to set the matter for hearing  within
sixty  (60) days  after the Claim  Date and (b) try any and all issues of law or
fact and report a statement of decision  upon them,  if possible,  within ninety

binding and conclusive and judgment shall be entered  pursuant to CCP 644 in the
Court.  All discovery  permitted by this  Agreement  shall be completed no later

The referee may extend such period in the event of a party's  refusal to provide
requested  discovery for any reason whatsoever,  including,  without limitation,
legal objections  raised to such discovery or unavailability of a witness due to
absence or  illness.  No party  shall be entitled  to  "priority"  in  conducing
discovery.  Depositions may be taken by either party upon seven (7) days written
notice,  and,  request  for  production  of  inspection  of  documents  shall be
responded  to within ten (10) days  after  service.  All  disputes  relating  to
discovery  which  cannot be resolved by the parties  shall be  submitted  to the
referee whose decision shall be final and binding upon the parties.

(b)  The  referee  shall  be  required  to  determine  all  issues  in
accordance  with  existing  case  law and the  statutory  laws of the  State  of
California.  The rules of evidence applicable to proceedings at law in the State
of California will be applicable to the reference proceeding.  The referee shall
be  empowered  to  enter  equitable  as well as legal  relief,  to  provide  all
temporary and/or provisional remedies and to enter equitable orders that will be
binding upon the parties. The referee shall issue a single judgment at the close
of the  reference  proceeding  which  shall  dispose of all of the claims of the
parties  that are the subject to the  reference.  The parties  hereto  expressly
reserve the right to contest or appeal from the final judgment or any appealable
order or  appealable  judgment  entered by the  referee.  The parties  expressly
reserve the right to findings of fact,  conclusions of law, a written  statement
of  decision,  and the  right to move for a new trial or a  different  judgment,
which new trial,  if granted,  is also to be a reference  proceeding  under this
provision.

(c) No  provision  of  Paragraphs  (a) or (b) of this  Section  10.13,
however,  shall limit the right of Lender to bring action for  possession of any

<PAGE>
collateral  in any  jurisdiction,  wherever  located,  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of the Security Documents.

attached hereto,  if any, are hereby  incorporated into this Credit Agreement by
each reference thereto as if fully set forth at each such reference.

10.15  Counterparts.  This  Credit  Agreement  may be  executed in multiple
counterparts,  each of which, when so executed,  shall be deemed an original but
all such counterparts shall constitute but one and the same agreement.

10.16  Participations.  Lender,  at any time, shall have the right to sell,
assign, transfer, negotiate or grant participation interests in the Loans and in
any documents and instruments executed in connection  herewith.  Borrower hereby
acknowledges  and agrees that any such  disposition  shall give rise to a direct
obligation  of  Borrower  to  each  such  assignee  or  participant.  Lender  is
authorized  to  furnish  to  any  participant  or  prospective  participant  any
information  or  document  that Lender may have or obtain  regarding  the Loans,

all liens, security interests,  claims, rights and demands of every kind against
the Collateral.

3. The undersigned hereby grants permission to Lender, its officers, agents
and  employees,  to enter,  at any time, the Real Property or any other premises
where the  Collateral may be found and to remove the  Collateral,  provided that
Lender shall promptly  reimburse the  undersigned  for the cost of repairing any

distraint or execution by the undersigned or to any claim of the undersigned.

5. The undersigned shall notify any purchaser of the Real Property, and any
subsequent  mortgagee or other encumbrance holder or claimant,  of the existence
of this  Waiver/Release  Agreement,  which shall be binding upon the  executors,
administrators, successors, assigns and transferees of the undersigned and shall
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Lender.

6. In the event of any default  under its lease or  agreement  with Debtor,
then  prior  to:  (i)  terminating  its lease or  agreement  with  Debtor,  (ii)
incurring any  attorneys'  fees, or (iii)  incurring any other expenses which it
would,  but for this  provision,  charge Debtor,  the  undersigned  shall notify
Lender in writing at the above  address of such default and allow Lender 30 days

provided, however, that if the default cannot reasonably be remedied within that

Debtor or incur any  attorneys'  fees or other  expenses so long as Lender shall
commence  to remedy  the  default  within  that  30-day  period  and  thereafter
diligently prosecute the remedy to completion.

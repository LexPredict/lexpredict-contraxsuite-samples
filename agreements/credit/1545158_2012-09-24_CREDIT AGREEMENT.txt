Item 1.02.    Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement









On September 18, 2012, Kraft Foods Group, Inc. provided notice to Barclays Bank PLC, as co-administrative agent and paying agent under the revolving credit agreement referred to below, of our optional election to terminate all of the lenders' commitments under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement among Kraft Foods Group, Inc., as borrower, Kraft Foods Inc. (our parent company), as guarantor, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and RBS Securities Inc., as joint bookrunners, Barclays Bank PLC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-administrative agents, and the lenders and other agents party thereto.  Kraft Foods Inc. was the guarantor of our obligations under the revolving credit agreement until the consummation of Kraft Foods Inc.'s previously announced spin-off of Kraft Foods Group, its North American grocery business, to its shareholders or the termination of the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement was scheduled to terminate on March 7, 2013. The initial aggregate principal amount available to us under the revolving credit agreement was $4 billion. No borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of the termination date referred to below.   Effective September 24, 2012, we repaid in full all of our obligations under the revolving credit agreement, including accrued fees and other amounts owing to the lenders. This amount did not include any material prepayment penalties or breakage costs or fees. Upon making these payments, (1) our and Kraft Foods Inc.'s obligations under the revolving credit agreement were satisfied in full and (2) the revolving credit agreement was immediately terminated other than customary provisions expressly specified to survive termination.
Some of the lenders under the revolving credit agreement and their affiliates have various relationships with us, Kraft Foods Inc. and our subsidiaries involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, investment banking and trust services.  In addition, we, Kraft Foods Inc. and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into foreign exchange and other derivatives arrangements with certain of the lenders and their affiliates.

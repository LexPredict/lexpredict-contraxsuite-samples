SECTION 2. The Commitments.

2.1 Advances. (a) Each Bank agrees, for itself only, to lend and to relend,
and to participate in Letter of Credit Advances pursuant to Section 3.1, in each
case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  to the Borrowers at
any time and from time to time from the  Effective  Date  until the  Termination
Date amounts equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such  aggregate  Advances as
any Borrower  may from time to time  request,  provided  that no Advances may be
made if the aggregate  outstanding amount of all Advances to all Borrowers would
exceed the lesser of the Commitments or the Borrowing Base;  provided,  however,
that the aggregate principal amount of Letters of Credit outstanding at any time
shall not exceed $5,000,000.  Each Loan made hereunder shall be evidenced by the
Notes, which shall mature and bear interest as set forth in Section 4 hereof and
in such Notes.  On the Effective  Date, the Borrowers shall issue and deliver to
each Bank a Note in the  principal  amount  of such  Bank's  Commitment  for the
period  beginning on the Effective Date. Each Loan which is a Floating Rate Loan
shall be in a minimum  amount of $500,000 and in integral  multiples of $100,000
and each  Loan  which is a  Eurodollar  Loan  shall be in a  minimum  amount  of
$1,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000.  No more than ten Eurodollar
Interest  Periods  shall be permitted  to exist at any one time.  Subject to the
terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  the  Borrowers  may  borrow,  prepay
pursuant to Section 4.1(b) and reborrow under this Section 2.1(a).

(b) For  purposes of this  Agreement,  a Letter of Credit  Advance (i)
shall be deemed  outstanding in an amount equal to the sum of the maximum amount
available to be drawn under the related Letter of Credit on or after the date of
determination and on or before the stated expiry date thereof plus the amount of
any draws under such Letter of Credit that have not been  reimbursed as provided
in Section 3.3 and (ii) shall be deemed  outstanding  at all times on and before
such stated  expiry date or such earlier date on which all amounts  available to
be drawn under such Letter of Credit have been fully drawn, and thereafter until
all related reimbursement obligations have been paid pursuant to Section 3.3. As
provided in Section  3.3,  upon each payment made by the Agent in respect of any
draft or other demand for payment under any Letter of Credit,  the amount of any
Letter of Credit Advance outstanding  immediately prior to such payment shall be
automatically  reduced by the amount of each Loan deemed  advanced in respect of
the related reimbursement obligation of the Borrowers.

(c) The  Borrowers  shall  have the right to  terminate  or reduce the
Commitments  at any time and from time to time,  provided that (i) the Borrowers

shall give notice of such  termination or reduction to the Agent  specifying the
amount  and  effective  date  thereof,   (ii)  each  partial  reduction  of  the
Commitments shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples
of  $1,000,000   and  shall  reduce  the   Commitments   of  all  of  the  Banks
proportionally in accordance with the respective Commitment amounts of each such
Bank,  (iii)  no such  termination  or  reduction,  either  in whole or part and
including without limitation any termination, shall be permitted with respect to
any  portion  of the  Commitments  as to which a request  for  Advances  is then
pending, and (iv) the Commitments may not be terminated if any Advances are then
outstanding  and may not be reduced below the principal  amount of Advances then
outstanding. The Commitments or any portion thereof so terminated or reduced may
not be reinstated.  Any Borrower may request Advances without the consent of any
other  Borrower,  and  each  Borrower  consents  to and  approves  any  Advances
requested by any other Borrower.  The Advances  hereunder  replace the revolving
credit loans and letters of credit outstanding pursuant to Section 2.1(a) of the
Existing Credit Agreement and provide additional credit as described above.

(d) This Agreement amends and restates the Existing Credit  Agreement,
and all Advances  and Letters of Credit  outstanding  under the Existing  Credit
Agreement shall  constitute  Advances and Letters of Credit under this Agreement
and all fees and other  obligations  accrued under the Existing Credit Agreement
will continue to accrue and be paid under this Agreement. As stated in the Notes
and the Consent and  Amendment  to Security  Documents,  the  Advances and other
obligations  pursuant  hereto are issued in  exchange  and  replacement  for the
Advances and other obligations under an Existing Credit Agreement,  shall not be
a novation or satisfaction  thereof and shall be entitled to the same collateral
with the same priority.

SECTION 3. The Advances.

3.1 Disbursement of Advances.  (a) Borrowers shall give notice to the Agent
of each requested Advance in substantially  the form of Exhibit C hereto,  which
notice  given shall be received by the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m.  (Chicago
time), (i) three Business Days prior to the date such Advance is requested to be
made if such Advance is to be made as a Eurodollar  Loan,  (ii) one Business Day
prior to the date such  Advance is requested to be made if such Advance is to be
made as a Floating  Rate Loan and (iii)  three  Business  Days prior to the date
such  Advance is to be made if such  Advance is to be made as a Letter of Credit
Advance.  Each  such  notice  given  shall be  irrevocable  and  binding  on the
Borrowers,  any such notice must  specify  the  Advance  Date,  which shall be a
Business  Day,  the  aggregate  amount  of such  Advance,  the  Type of  Advance
selected,  in the case of any Eurodollar  Loan, the Eurodollar  Interest  Period
applicable  thereto,  and in the case of any Letter of Credit Advance such other
information  and documents with respect thereto as may be required by the Agent.
The Agent shall  provide  notice of such  requested  Advance to each Bank on the
same  Business Day such notice is received  from the  Borrowers.  Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement,  the Agent shall, on the date any Letter
of Credit Advance is requested to be made, issue the related Letter of Credit on
behalf of the Banks for the account of the designated Borrower.  Notwithstanding
anything  herein to the  contrary,  the Agent may decline to issue any requested
Letter of Credit on the basis that the  beneficiary,  the purpose of issuance or
the terms or the  conditions  of drawing  are illegal or contrary to a policy of
the Agent.

(b) Floating  Rate Loans shall  continue as Floating Rate Loans unless
and until such Floating Rate Loans are converted  into  Eurodollar  Loans.  Each
Eurodollar  Loan of any Type shall  continue as a  Eurodollar  Loan of such Type
until the end of the then  applicable  Interest Period  therefor,  at which time
such Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically  converted into a Floating Rate Loan
unless the Borrower shall have given the Agent a Conversion/Continuation  Notice
requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Loan either
continue  as a  Eurodollar  Loan for the same or another  Interest  Period or be
converted into a Loan of another Type.  Subject to the terms of Section 2.1, the
Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of a Loan of any
Type into any other Type or Types of a Loan; provided that any conversion of any
Eurodollar  Loan  shall be made on,  and only on,  the last day of the  Interest


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 11


<PAGE>



Period applicable thereto. The Borrowers shall give the Agent irrevocable notice
(a   "Conversion/Continuation   Notice")  of  each   conversion  of  a  Loan  or
continuation  of a Eurodollar  Loan not later than 10:00 a.m.  (Chicago time) at
least one Business  Day, in the case of a conversion  into a Floating Rate Loan,
or three Business Days, in the case of a conversion  into or  continuation  of a
Eurodollar Loan, prior to the date of the requested  conversion or continuation,
specifying:

(i) the  requested  date,  which shall be a Business Day, of such
conversion or continuation,

(ii) the  aggregate  amount  and Type of the Loan  which is to be
converted or continued, and

(iii) the amount and  Type(s) of Loan(s)  into which such Loan is
to be  converted  or  continued  and,  in  the  case  of a  conversion  into  or
continuation  of  a  Eurodollar  Loan,  the  duration  of  the  Interest  Period
applicable thereto.

(c)  Subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  the
proceeds of such  requested  Loan shall be made  available  to the  Borrowers by
depositing the proceeds thereof, in immediately  available funds, on the Advance
Date for such Loan in an account  maintained  and designated by the Borrowers at
the principal  office of the Agent.  Each Bank, on the Advance Date of each such
Loan  shall  make  its Pro Rata  Share of such  Loan  available  in  immediately
available  funds at the principal  office of the Agent for  disbursement  to the
Borrowers.  Unless the Agent shall have  received  notice from any Bank prior to
the date of any  requested  Loan under this  Section 3.1 that such Bank will not
make  available  to the Agent such Bank's Pro Rata  Share,  the Agent may assume
that such Bank has made such share available to the Agent on the Advance Date of
such Loan in accordance with this Section 3.1(b). If and to the extent such Bank
shall not have so made such Pro Rata Share available to the Agent, the Agent may
(but shall not be obligated  to) make such amount  available to the Borrowers on
the relevant Advance Date, and such Bank agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on
demand such amount  together with interest  thereon,  for each day from the date
such amount is made  available to the Borrowers by the Agent until the date such
amount is paid to the Agent,  at the Federal  Funds Rate. If such Bank shall pay
to the Agent such  amount,  such amount so paid shall  constitute a Loan by such
Bank as a part of such borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.  The failure of
any Bank to make its Pro Rata  Share of any such  Loan  available  to the  Agent
shall not relieve any other Bank of its  obligations  to make  available its Pro
Rata Share of such Loan on the Advance  Date of such Loan,  but no Bank shall be
responsible  for failure of any other Bank to make such Pro Rata Share available
to the Agent on the Advance Date of any such Loan.


(d) Each Bank may book its Loans at any Lending Installation  selected
by such Bank and may  change its  Lending  Installation  from time to time.  All
terms of this  Agreement  shall apply to any such Lending  Installation  and the
Notes  shall  be  deemed  held by each  Bank  for the  benefit  of such  Lending
Installation.  Each Bank may,  by written  or telex  notice to the Agent and the
Borrowers,  designate a Lending Installation through which Loans will be made by
it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.

(e)  Nothing  in this  Agreement  shall be  construed  to  require  or
authorize any Bank to issue any Letter of Credit,  it being  recognized that the
Agent has the sole obligation under this Agreement to issue Letters of Credit on
behalf of the Banks, and the Commitment of each Lender with respect to Letter of
Credit Advances is expressly  conditioned  upon the Agent's  performance of such
obligations.  Upon such issuance by the Agent, each Bank shall automatically and
unconditionally  acquire a risk participation  interest to the extent of its Pro
Rata Share in such Letter of Credit Advance based on its respective  Commitment.
If the Agent shall honor a draft or other  demand for payment  presented or made
under any Letter of Credit,  the Agent shall provide notice thereof to each Bank


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 12


<PAGE>



on the date such draft or demand is  honored  unless  the  Borrowers  shall have
satisfied  their  reimbursement  obligation  under Section 3.3 by payment to the
Agent on such date.  Each Bank,  not later than the Business Day after the Agent
shall have given the notice specified in the previous  sentence,  shall make its
Pro  Rata  Share  of the  amount  paid by the  Agent  available  in  immediately
available  funds at the  principal  office of the Agent for the  account  of the
Agent.  If and to the extent such Bank shall not have made any required Pro Rata
Share  amount  available  to the  Agent or made its  portion  of Loan  available
pursuant to Section  3.3(a)(i),  such Bank and the Borrowers  severally agree to
pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date such  amount was paid by the Agent  until such amount
is so made  available to the Agent at (i) the interest  rate then  applicable to
Floating  Rate Loans for such day in the case of the Borrowers and (ii) the rate
per  annum  equal  to the  Federal  Funds  Rate for the  first  five  days,  and
thereafter at the interest rate  applicable to Floating Rate Loans,  in the case
of any Bank. If such Bank shall pay such amount to the Agent  together with such
interest,  such amount so paid shall  constitute  a Loan by such Bank as part of
the Loans disbursed in respect of the reimbursement  obligation of the Borrowers
under  Section 3.3 for  purposes of this  Agreement.  The failure of any Bank to
make its Pro Rata Share of any such  amount paid by the Agent  available  to the
Agent shall not relieve any other Bank of its  obligation to make  available its
Pro Rata Share of such amount,  but no Bank shall be responsible  for failure of
any other Bank to make such Pro Rata Share available to the Agent.

3.2 Conditions of Advances.  The Banks and the Agent shall not be obligated

3.3 Letter of Credit Reimbursement Payments.  (a)(i) The Borrowers agree to
pay to the  Agent,  on the day on which the Agent  shall  honor a draft or other
demand for payment presented or made under any Letter of Credit, an amount equal
to the amount paid by the Agent in respect of such draft or other  demand  under
such Letter of Credit and all  expenses  paid or incurred by the Agent  relative
thereto.  Unless the Borrowers shall have made such payment to the Agent on such


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 14


<PAGE>



day,  upon each such  payment  by the Agent,  the Agent  shall be deemed to have
disbursed to the Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to
satisfy the  reimbursement  obligation by borrowing,  a Loan bearing interest at
the Floating  Rate for the account of the Banks in an amount equal to the amount
so paid by the Agent in respect of such draft or other  demand under such Letter
of Credit.  Such Loan shall be  disbursed,  and each Bank shall  advance its Pro
Rata Share  thereof,  notwithstanding  any failure to satisfy any conditions for
disbursement of any Loan set forth in Article III or any other condition and, to
the  extent  of the  Loan so  disbursed,  the  reimbursement  obligation  of the
Borrowers under this Section 3.3 shall be deemed satisfied;  provided,  however,
that  such  disbursement  shall  not be  deemed  to be a waiver  of any Event of
Default or Default, if any.

(ii) If for any reason (including  without limitation as a result
of the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to Section  6.1(h)),  Floating
Rate Loans may not be made by the Banks as described in Section 3.3(a)(i),  then
(A) the Borrowers agree that each reimbursement  amount not paid pursuant to the
first sentence of Section  3.3(a)(i)  shall bear interest,  payable on demand by
the Agent, at the interest rate then applicable to Floating Rate Loans,  and (B)
effective on the date each such  Floating  Rate Loan would  otherwise  have been
made, each Bank severally agrees that it shall  unconditionally and irrevocably,
without regard to the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,  in lieu of
a deemed  disbursement  of Loans,  to the extent of such  Bank's Pro Rata Share,
purchase a participating  interest in each reimbursement  amount. Each Bank will
immediately  transfer  to the  Agent,  in same  day  funds,  the  amount  of its
participation.  Each Bank  shall  share in  accordance  with its Pro Rata  Share
(calculated  by reference to the  Commitments)  in any  interest  which  accrues
thereon and in all repayments  thereof. If and to the extent that any Bank shall
not have so made the  amount of such  participating  interest  available  to the
Agent, such Bank and the Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand
such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand
by the Agent until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at (x) in the case
of the Borrowers,  the interest rate then  applicable to Floating Rate Loans and
(y) in the case of such Bank,  the  Federal  Funds Rate for the first five days,
and thereafter the interest rate applicable to Floating Rate Loans.

(b) The reimbursement  obligations of the Borrowers under this Section
3.3 shall be absolute,  unconditional  and  irrevocable and shall remain in full
force and effect  until all  obligations  of the  Borrowers to the Agent and the
Banks hereunder shall have been satisfied, and such obligations of the Borrowers
shall not be  affected,  modified or impaired  upon the  happening of any event,
including without limitation,  any of the following,  whether or not with notice
to, or the consent of, the Borrowers:

(i) Any lack of  validity  or  enforceability  of any  Letter  of
Credit  or  any  documentation  relating  to  any  Letter  of  Credit  or to any
transaction  related in any way to such Letter of Credit (the  "Letter of Credit
Documents");

(ii) Any  amendment,  modification,  waiver  or  consent,  or any
substitution,  exchange  or release of or failure  to perfect  any  interest  in
collateral or security, with respect to any of the Letter of Credit Documents.

(iii) The existence of any claim, setoff,  defense or other right
which  the  Borrowers  may  have at any  time  against  any  beneficiary  or any
transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any persons or entities for whom any such
beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting),  the Agent or any Bank or any
other person or entity,  whether in connection  with any of the Letter of Credit
Documents,  the  transactions  contemplated  herein or therein or any  unrelated
transactions;

(iv) Any draft or other statement or document presented under any
Letter of Credit proving to be forged,  fraudulent,  invalid or  insufficient in
any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 15


<PAGE>





(v) Payment by the Agent to the  beneficiary  under any Letter of
Credit against  presentation  of documents which do not comply with the terms of
the Letter of Credit,  including  failure of any documents to bear any reference
or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit;

(vi)  Any  failure,  omission,  delay  or lack on the part of the
Agent or any Bank or any  party to any of the  Letter  of  Credit  Documents  to
enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred upon the Agent,
any Bank or any such party under this  Agreement  or any of the Letter of Credit
Documents,  or any other acts or omissions on the part of the Agent, any Bank or
any such party; or

(vii) Any other event or circumstance  that would, in the absence
of this  clause,  result in the  release or  discharge  by  operation  of law or
otherwise the Borrowers from the  performance  or observance of any  obligation,
covenant or agreement  contained  in this Section 3.3. No setoff,  counterclaim,
reduction or diminution  of any  obligation or any defense of any kind or nature
which the Borrowers  have or may have against the  beneficiary  of any Letter of
Credit shall be available  hereunder to the  Borrowers  against the Agent or any
Bank.  Nothing in this  Section  3.3 shall limit the  liability,  if any, of the
Borrowers to the Banks pursuant to Section 10.5(b).

3.4.  Withholding  Tax Exemption.  At least five Business Days prior to the
first date on which  interest or fees are payable  hereunder  for the account of
any Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States
of  America,  or a state  thereof,  agrees  that it will  deliver to each of the
Borrowers  and the Agent two duly  completed  copies of United  States  Internal
Revenue  Service Form 1001 or 4224,  certifying in either case that such Bank is
entitled  to  receive  payments  under  this  Agreement  and the  Notes  without
deduction or withholding  of any United States  federal income taxes.  Each Bank
which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further  undertakes  to deliver to each of
the Borrowers and the Agent two  additional  copies of such form (or a successor
form) on or before the date that such form expires (currently,  three successive
calendar  years for Form 1001 and one  calendar  year for Form  4224) or becomes
obsolete  or after the  occurrence  of any event  requiring a change in the most
recent forms so delivered by it, and such  amendments  thereto or  extensions or
renewals  thereof as may be reasonably  requested by the Borrowers or the Agent,
in each case  certifying  that such Bank is entitled to receive  payments  under
this  Agreement and the Notes  without  deduction or  withholding  of any United
States federal income taxes,  unless an event (including  without limitation any
change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any
such  delivery  would  otherwise  be  required  which  renders  all  such  forms
inapplicable  or  which  would  prevent  such  Bank  from  duly  completing  and
delivering  any such form with respect to it and such Bank advises the Borrowers
and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction
or withholding of United States federal income tax.

SECTION 4. Payment and Prepayment; Fees; Change in Circumstances.

4.1 Principal Payments.

(a) Unless  earlier  payment is  required  under this  Agreement,  the
Borrowers shall pay the entire  outstanding  principal amount of the Advances on
the Termination Date.

(b) The Borrowers may from time to time prepay all or a portion of the
Advances without premium or penalty,  provided,  however, that (i) the Borrowers
shall have given not less than one Business  Day's prior written  notice thereof
to the Agent, (ii) other than mandatory payments,  each such prepayment,  in the
case of  prepayment of Floating  Rate Loans,  shall be in the minimum  amount of
$500,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000 and, in the case of prepayment of
Eurodollar  Loans,  shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 and in integral
multiples  thereof,  (iii)  any  prepayment  of any  Eurodollar  Loan  shall  be
accompanied by any amount required pursuant to Section 4.10.

CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 16


<PAGE>



(c) If it should be  determined by the Agent at any time and from time
to time that the principal  amount of the Advances exceed the lesser of the then
Borrowing Base or the Commitments (such condition defined herein as a "Borrowing
Base Deficiency"), the Borrowers shall within thirty (30) days of written notice
to the Borrowers of such  Borrowing  Base  Deficiency,  in addition to all other
payments of principal and interest  required to be paid on the Advances,  prepay
upon demand and without  premium or penalty the  Advances in an amount by which,
in the determination of the Agent, such aggregate  principal amount  outstanding
exceeds the lesser of the then Borrowing Base or the Commitments,  provided that
such  prepayment  shall be made  first on the Loans and if the Loans are paid in
full and such excess still exists,  the Borrowers  shall provide cash collateral
for any outstanding Letters of Credit to the extent of such remaining excess.

(d) In addition to all other  payments  required  hereunder,  upon any
sale or other  disposition of any assets when a Default exists,  or if such sale
or other disposition would cause a Default or would cause a required  prepayment
of, or offer to purchase,  the Indenture  Notes,  the Borrowers shall prepay the
Advances by an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds  (net only of reasonable
and  customary  costs  of  such  sale or  other  disposition)  of  such  sale or
disposition, which prepayment is due upon receipt of such net proceeds.

(e) In addition to all other  payments  required  hereunder,  upon any
sale or other disposition of any assets when a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists,
or if such sale or other  disposition  would cause a Borrowing Base  Deficiency,
the  Borrower  shall  prepay the  Advances by the amount of the  Borrowing  Base
Deficiency from the net proceeds (net only of any reasonable and customary costs
of such sale or other disposition) of such sale or disposition, which prepayment
is due upon receipt of such net proceeds.

Unless  specified  as  a  determination  to  be  made  by  all  Banks,  all
determinations  made  pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall be made by the Agent or
the Required Banks, as the case may be, and shall be conclusively binding on the
parties absent manifest error.

4.2 Interest Payment.  (a) The Borrowers shall pay interest to the Banks on
the unpaid principal  amount of each Loan for the period  commencing on the date
such Loan is made until such Loan is paid in full, on each Interest Payment Date
and at maturity (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise),  and
thereafter on demand,  at the following rates per annum: (i) during such periods
that such Loan is a Floating Rate Loan,  the Floating Rate, and (ii) during such
periods that such Loan is a Eurodollar  Loan, the Eurodollar  Rate applicable to
such Loan for each related Eurodollar Interest Period.

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Borrowers hereby
agree,  if  requested by the  Required  Banks,  to pay interest on demand at the
Overdue  Rate on the  outstanding  principal  amount  of any Loan and any  other
amount payable by the Borrowers  hereunder (other than interest) upon and during
the continuance of any Default.

4.3 Fees.  (a) The  Borrowers  agree to pay to the Agent,  for the pro rata
account of the Banks in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares,  a commitment fee
computed at the per annum rate equal to the  Applicable  Margin on the amount by
which the Borrowing Base exceeds the aggregate  outstanding  principal amount of
the Advances for the period from the Effective Date until the Termination  Date.
Such fee shall be paid  quarterly  in arrears on the last  Business  Day of each
March, June, September and December and on the Termination Date.

(b) The  Borrowers  agree (i) to pay to the Agent,  for the benefit of
the  Banks,  a fee  computed  at the  Applicable  Margin on the  maximum  amount
available  to be drawn under each Letter of Credit at the time such fee is to be
paid for the period  from and  including  the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit to and  including  the stated  expiry date of such Letter of Credit,  and
(ii) to pay an additional  fee to the Agent for its own account  computed at the


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 17


<PAGE>


rate of 0.25% per annum on such maximum amount for such period.  Such fees shall
be payable  each month in  advance,  payable on the date of the  issuance of any
Letter of Credit and each month thereafter.  Such fees are nonrefundable and the
Borrowers  shall not be entitled  to any rebate of any  portion  thereof if such
Letter of Credit  does not remain  outstanding  through  the date for which such
fees have been paid. The Borrowers further agree to pay to the Agent, on demand,
such other customary  administrative  fees, charges and expenses of the Agent in
respect  of the  issuance,  negotiation,  acceptance,  amendment,  transfer  and
payment  of  each  Letter  of  Credit  or  otherwise  payable  pursuant  to  the
application  and  related  documentation  under  which such  Letter of Credit is
issued.

(c) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent,  for the pro rata benefit
of the Banks,  an upfront fee equal to 0.50% of the amount of the  Commitment of
each Bank, payable on the Effective Date.

(d) The Borrowers  agree to pay to the Agent agency and servicing fees
for its  services  under this  Agreement  in such amounts as it may from time to
time be agreed upon  between  the  Borrowers  and the Agent,  which fee shall be
retained solely by the Agent.

4.4 Payment Method. All payments to be made by the Borrowers hereunder will
be made in  Dollars  and in  immediately  available  funds  to the  Agent at its
address set forth in Section 10.2 not later than 11:00 a.m.  Chicago time on the
date on which such payment shall become due.  Payments received after 11:00 a.m.
Chicago  time shall be deemed to be  payments  made prior to 11:00 a.m.  Chicago
time on the next  succeeding  Business  Day.  At the time of  making  each  such
payment,  the  Borrowers  shall  specify  to the Agent  that  obligation  of the
Borrowers  hereunder  to which such  payment is to be applied,  or, in the event
that the  Borrowers  fail to so  specify  or if an Event of  Default  shall have
occurred  and be  continuing,  the  Agent  may  apply  such  payments  as it may
determine in its sole  discretion.  On the day such payments are  received,  the
Agent  shall  remit  to the  Banks  their  respective  Pro Rata  Shares  of such
payments, in immediately available funds.

4.5 No Setoff or  Deduction.  All  payments of principal of and interest on
the Advances and other amounts payable by the Borrowers  hereunder shall be made
by the  Borrowers  without  setoff or  counterclaim,  and free and clear of, and
without  deduction or  withholding  for, or on account of, any present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments,  or other charges of whatever
nature, imposed by any governmental authority,  or by any department,  agency or
other political subdivision or taxing authority.

4.6 Payment on Non-Business Day; Payment Computations.  Except as otherwise
provided  in  this  Agreement  to the  contrary,  whenever  any  installment  of
principal  of, or interest on, any Advances  outstanding  hereunder or any other
amount due  hereunder,  becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business
Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding  Business Day
and, in the case of any  installment  of  principal,  interest  shall be payable
thereon  at the rate per annum  determined  in  accordance  with this  Agreement
during such extension. Computations of interest and other amounts due under this
Agreement shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number
of days  elapsed,  including  the  first day but  excluding  the last day of the
relevant period.

4.7. Yield Protection. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental
rule,  regulation,  policy,  guideline or  directive  (whether or not having the
force of law),  or any  interpretation  thereof,  or the  compliance of any Bank
therewith,

(i) subjects any Bank or any applicable  Lending  Installation to
any tax, duty,  charge or withholding on or from payments due from the Borrowers
(excluding  federal taxation of the overall net income of any Bank or applicable
Lending Installation),  or changes the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank
in respect of its Loans or other amounts due it hereunder, or

CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 18


<PAGE>



(ii)  imposes  or  increases  or deems  applicable  any  reserve,
assessment,  insurance charge,  special deposit or similar  requirement  against
assets of,  deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank
or any  applicable  Lending  Installation  (other than reserves and  assessments
taken into account in  determining  the interest  rate  applicable to Eurodollar
Loans), or

(iii)  imposes  any  other  condition  the  result of which is to
increase the cost to any Bank or any applicable Lending  Installation of making,
funding or maintaining loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Bank or any
applicable  Lending  Installation in connection with loans, or requires any Bank
or any  applicable  Lending  Installation  to make  any  payment  calculated  by
reference  to the amount of loans held or interest  received by it, by an amount
deemed material by such Bank,

then,  within 30 days of demand by such Bank, the Borrowers  shall pay such Bank
that  portion of such  increased  expense  incurred  or  reduction  in an amount
received  which such Bank  determines  is  attributable  to making,  funding and
maintaining its Loans and its Commitment.

4.8.  Changes in Capital  Adequacy  Regulations.  If a Bank  determines the
amount of capital  required  or  expected  to be  maintained  by such Bank,  any
Lending  Installation of such Bank or any corporation  controlling  such Bank is
increased as a result of a Change,  then, within 15 days of demand by such Bank,
the Borrowers  shall pay such Bank the amount  necessary to  compensate  for any
shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such  increased  capital which
such Bank  determines is  attributable  to this  Agreement,  its Advances or its
Commitment  (after  taking  into  account  such  Bank's  policies  as to capital
adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in the
Risk-Based  Capital  Guidelines  or (ii) any  adoption of or change in any other
law, governmental or quasi-governmental  rule,  regulation,  policy,  guideline,
interpretation,  or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the
date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital  required or expected
to be  maintained  by any Bank or any Lending  Installation  or any  corporation
controlling any Bank.  "Risk-Based  Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including  transition  rules,  and (ii) the  corresponding  capital  regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle  Committee on Banking  Regulation and  Supervisory
Practices  Entitled  "International  Convergence  of  Capital  Measurements  and
Capital  Standards,"  including  transition  rules,  and any  amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

4.9.  Availability  of  Types of  Advances.  If any  Bank  determines  that
maintenance of its Eurodollar  Loans at a suitable  Lending  Installation  would
violate any  applicable  law,  rule,  regulation,  or directive,  whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Banks determine that (i) deposits of
a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Loans are not available
or (ii) the interest rate  applicable  to a Type of Advance does not  accurately
reflect the cost of making or  maintaining  such  Advance,  then the Agent shall
suspend  the  availability  of the  affected  Type of Advance  and  require  any
Eurodollar Loans of the affected Type to be repaid.

4.10. Funding  Indemnification.  If any payment of a Eurodollar Loan occurs
on a date which is not the last day of the applicable  Interest Period,  whether
because of  acceleration,  prepayment or otherwise,  or a Eurodollar Loan is not
made on the date specified by the Borrowers for any reason other than default by
the Banks,  the Borrowers will indemnify each Bank for any loss or cost incurred
by it resulting therefrom,  including,  without limitation,  any loss or cost in
liquidating  or employing  deposits  acquired to fund or maintain the Eurodollar
Loan.

4.11.  Bank  Statements;  Survival of Indemnity.  To the extent  reasonably
possible,  each Bank shall  designate an  alternate  Lending  Installation  with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 19


<PAGE>


Bank  under  Sections  4.7 and 4.8 or to avoid the  unavailability  of a Type of
Advance under Section 4.9, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to
such  Bank.  Each Bank  shall  deliver a written  statement  of such Bank to the
Borrowers  (with  a copy to the  Agent)  as to the  amount  due,  if any,  under
Sections 4.7, 4.8 or 4.10. Such written  statement shall set forth in reasonable
detail the calculations upon which such Bank determined such amount and shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error.
Determination  of amounts  payable  under such  Sections  in  connection  with a
Eurodollar  Loan shall be calculated  as though each Bank funded its  Eurodollar
Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to
the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to
such Loan,  whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless  otherwise  provided

documents,  and shall take such other action, as the Agent or the Required Banks
may reasonably consider necessary or proper to evidence or perfect the liens and
security interests described in Section 5.1 hereof.

SECTION 6. Representations and Warranties.

Each of the Borrowers represents and warrants that:

6.1 Corporate  Existence and Power.  It is a  corporation  duly  organized,
validly  existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, and is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each
additional  jurisdiction  where  failure  to so  qualify  would  have a Material
Adverse Effect.  It has all requisite  corporate power to own its properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted,
and to execute and deliver this Agreement,  the Notes and the Security Documents
and to engage in the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, the Notes and
the Security Documents.

6.2 Corporate Authority.  The execution,  delivery and performance by it of
this  Agreement,  the Notes and the Security  Documents are within its corporate
powers,  have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and are not
in contravention of any law, rule or regulation, or any judgment,  decree, writ,
injunction,  order or award of any arbitrator,  court or governmental authority,
or of the terms of its charter or by-laws,  or of any contract or undertaking to
which it is a party or by which it or its property may be bound or affected.

6.3  Binding  Effect.  This  Agreement  is, and the Notes and the  Security
Documents to which it is a party when delivered  hereunder will be, legal, valid
and binding obligations of each Borrower, enforceable against each in accordance
with their respective terms.

6.4  Subsidiaries.  All  Subsidiaries  of CRI are duly  organized,  validly
existing  and in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of  their  jurisdictions  of
organization  and are duly qualified to do business in each  jurisdiction  where
failure to so qualify  would have a Material  Adverse  Effect.  All  outstanding
shares of Capital  Stock of each class of each  Subsidiary  of CRI have been and
will be validly issued and are and will be fully paid and  nonassessable and are
and will be owned,  beneficially  and of record,  by CRI,  free and clear of any
Liens.  Schedule 6.4 is a complete list of all  Subsidiaries  of CRI. COG is and
will  remain  a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of CRI and COGL is and will  remain a
wholly owned  subsidiary  of COG, and Offshore is and will remain a wholly owned
subsidiary of COGL.

6.5 Liens.  The  properties  of each  Borrower and each  Subsidiary  of any
Borrower  (including  without  limitation the Collateral) are not subject to any
Lien except Permitted Liens.

6.6 Litigation.  There is no action,  suit or proceeding pending or, to the
best of its  knowledge,  threatened  against  or  affecting  it before or by any
court, governmental authority, or arbitrator which would be reasonably likely to
result in, either  individually or collectively,  a Material Adverse Effect and,
to the best of the Borrowers' knowledge,  there is no basis for any such action,
suit or proceeding.

6.7  Financial  Condition.  The  consolidated  balance sheet of CRI and its
Subsidiaries and the consolidated  statements of income and cash flow of CRI and
its  Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 and reported on by
Arthur Andersen,  LLP, copies of which have been furnished to the Banks,  fairly
present,  and  the  financial  statements  of CRI  and  its  Subsidiaries  to be
delivered  pursuant  to Section  7.1(d) will fairly  present,  the  consolidated
financial  position  of CRI  and its  Subsidiaries  as of the  respective  dates
thereof,  and the consolidated results of operations of CRI and its Subsidiaries
for the respective periods indicated,  all in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles   consistently  applied.  There  has  been  no  event  or
development  which  has had or would be  reasonably  likely  to have a  Material
Adverse Effect since December 31, 1998.

<PAGE>



There is no material Contingent Liability of CRI or any of its Subsidiaries that
is not reflected in such financial statements or in the notes thereto.

6.8 Use of  Advances.  The  Advances  will be used for working  capital and
general corporate  purposes.  No Borrower extends or maintains,  in the ordinary
course of business,  credit for the purpose, whether immediate,  incidental,  or
ultimate, of buying or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U
of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve  System),  and no part of the
proceeds  of each  Advance  will be used  for the  purpose,  whether  immediate,
incidental,  or  ultimate,  of  buying  or  carrying  any such  margin  stock or
maintaining or extending  credit to others for such purpose.  After applying the
proceeds of the Advances, such margin stock will not constitute more than 25% of
the value of the assets that are subject to any  provisions of this Agreement or
any Security  Document  that may cause the  Advances to be secured,  directly or
indirectly by margin stock.

6.9  Security  Documents.   The  Security  Documents  create  a  valid  and
enforceable  first-  priority  lien on and  perfected  security  interest in all
right,  title and interest of each Borrower in and to the  Collateral  described
therein,  securing all amounts intended to be secured thereby (including without
limitation  all  principal  of and  interest on the Notes)  subject  only to the
Permitted Liens. The respective net revenue interests of each Borrower in and to
the Oil and Gas  Interests as set forth in the Security  Documents  are true and
correct and  accurately  reflect the interests to which each Borrower is legally
entitled, subject only to the Permitted Liens.

6.10  Consents,   Etc.  No  consent,   approval  or   authorization  of  or
declaration,  registration  or filing  with any  governmental  authority  or any
nongovernmental  Person or entity,  including without limitation any creditor or
stockholder  of it,  is  required  on the  part  of it in  connection  with  the
execution,  delivery and performance of this Agreement,  the Notes, the Security
Documents  or the  transactions  contemplated  hereby or as a  condition  to the
legality,  validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes or any of the
Security Documents.

6.11  Taxes.  It has  filed all tax  returns  (federal,  state  and  local)
required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown  thereon to be due,  including
interest and penalties,  or has established  adequate  financial reserves on its
books and records for payment  thereof,  except where the failure to do so would
not have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.12 Title to Properties.  It has good and defensible title to, and a valid
indefeasible ownership interest in, all of its properties and assets (including,
without  limitation,  the Collateral subject to the Security Documents) free and
clear of any Lien  except the  Permitted  Liens,  and it is the owner of all the
Collateral described in the Security Documents to which it is a party. All wells
on any of the mortgaged premises have been drilled, operated, shut-in, abandoned
or  suspended  in  accordance  with  good  oil and gas  field  practices  and in
compliance with all applicable laws, permits,  statutes, orders, licenses, rules
and  regulations.  All leases with respect to any Oil and Gas Interests owned by
any  Borrower  are in good  standing  and  are in full  force  and  effect,  all
royalties,  rents,  taxes,  assessments  and other  payments  thereunder or with
respect thereto have been properly and timely paid and all conditions  necessary
to keep such leases in full force have been fully performed,  including  without
limitation  any condition to maintain  continuous  production or other  activity
with respect  thereto.  The Borrowers have delivered to the Agent title opinions
satisfactory  to the Agent and the Agent's  counsel with respect to at least 80%
of the value of the assets included in the Borrowing Base.

6.13 ERISA.  CRI and its  Subsidiaries and their Plans are in compliance in
all material  respects with those  provisions of ERISA and of the Code which are
applicable  with respect to any Plan. No prohibited  transaction  (as defined in
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 9975 of the Code) and no  reportable  event (as
defined in ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Plan. Neither CRI, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of  its ERISA Affiliates is an employer with respect to any

CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 22


<PAGE>



multiemployer  plan (as  defined  in Section  4001(a)(3)  of  ERISA).  CRI,  its
Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates have met the minimum funding  requirements
under ERISA and the Code with respect to each of the respective  Plans,  if any,
and  have not  incurred  any  liability  to the  PBGC or any  Plan.  There is no
unfunded benefit liability with respect to any Plan.

6.14 Environmental and Safety Matters.  It is in compliance in all material
respects  with all federal,  state and local laws,  ordinances  and  regulations
relating to safety and  industrial  hygiene or to the  environmental  condition,
including without limitation all Environmental Laws in jurisdictions in which it
owns any  interest in or operates,  a well, a facility or site,  or arranges for
disposal or treatment of hazardous  substances,  solid waste,  or other  wastes,
accepts for transporting any hazardous substances, solid waste, or other wastes,
or holds any  interest in real  property  or  otherwise,  except  where any such
noncompliance  would not have a  Material  Adverse  Effect.  No  demand,  claim,
notice, suit, suit in equity, action,  administrative  action,  investigation or
inquiry whether brought by any governmental authority,  private Person or entity
or otherwise, arising under, relating to or in connection with any Environmental
Laws is pending or, to the best of any Borrower's knowledge,  threatened against
it, any real  property  in which it holds or has held an interest or any past or
present  operation  of  it.  It (a)  does  not  know  of any  federal  or  state
investigation  evaluating  whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a
release of any toxic  substances,  radioactive  materials,  hazardous  wastes or
related  materials into the environment,  (b) has not received any notice of any
toxic substances,  radioactive  materials,  hazardous waste or related materials
in, or upon any of its  properties in violation of any  Environmental  Laws, and
(c) does not know of any basis for any such investigation,  notice or violation.
No material release,  threatened  release or disposal of hazardous waste,  solid
waste or other  wastes is  occurring  or has  occurred  on, under or to any real
property in which it holds any  interest or performs any of its  operations,  in
violation of any Environmental Law which would have a Material Adverse Effect.

6.15 Direct  Benefit.  The initial  Advances  hereunder and all  additional
Advances are for the direct  benefit of each of the  Borrowers,  and the initial
Advances  hereunder  are  used to  refinance  and  replace  indebtedness  owing,
directly or indirectly,  by the Borrowers to the Banks under the Existing Credit
Agreement.  The Borrowers are engaged as an integrated  group in the business of
oil and gas exploration and related fields,  and any benefits to any Borrower is
a  benefit  to all  of  them,  both  directly  or  indirectly,  inasmuch  as the
successful  operation  and  condition of the  Borrowers  is  dependent  upon the
continued  successful  performance of the functions of the integrated group as a
whole.

6.16  Solvency.  Each of the  following  is true for each  Borrower and the
Borrowers on a consolidated  basis:  (a) the fair saleable value of its property
is (i) greater than the total amount of its  liabilities  (including  contingent
liabilities), and (ii) greater than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable aggregate  liability on its then existing debts as they become absolute
and matured; (b) its property is not unreasonable in relation to its business or
any contemplated or undertaken transaction; and (c) it does not intend to incur,
or believe  that it will  incur,  debts  beyond its ability to pay such debts as
they become due.

6.17  Disclosure.  This  Agreement and all other  documents,  certificates,
reports or statements or other information furnished to any Bank or the Agent in
writing by or on behalf of any Borrower in connection  with the  negotiation  or
administration  of this Agreement or any transactions  contemplated  hereby when
read together do not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein
and therein not  misleading.  There is no fact known to any  Borrower  which has
caused,  or which likely would in the future in the  reasonable  judgment of the
Borrowers cause, a Material  Adverse Effect (except for any economic  conditions
which  affect   generally   the  industry  in  which  the  Borrowers  and  their
Subsidiaries  conduct business),  which has not been set forth in this Agreement
or  in  the  other  documents,  certificates,   statements,  reports  and  other
information furnished in writing to the Banks by or on behalf of any Borrower in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.18  Indenture  Debt  Documents  and  Preferred   Stock   Documents.   All
representations  and warranties of the Borrowers contained in any Indenture Debt
Document  or  Preferred  Stock  Document  are true and  correct in all  material
respects.  CRI has issued  the  Indenture  Notes in the face  amount of at least
$150,000,000  on or prior to the Effective Date and all Indenture Debt Documents
have been delivered to the Agent and the Banks prior to the Effective  Date. CRI
has issued the Preferred  Stock in the amount of  $30,000,000 on or prior to the
Effective  Date and all Preferred  Stock  Documents  have been  delivered to the
Agent and the Banks prior to the Effective Date. There is no event of default or
event or  condition  which could become an event of default with notice or lapse
of time or both, under the Indenture Debt Documents or Preferred Stock Documents
and each of the Indenture Debt Documents and the Preferred Stock Documents is in
full force and effect.

6.19 Year 2000. The Borrowers  have made a full and complete  assessment of
the Year 2000 Issues. Based on such assessment,  the Borrowers do not reasonably
anticipate that Year 2000 Issues will have a Material Adverse Effect.

financial reserves have been established on its books and records.

any Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, any of the Notes or
the  Security  Documents,  any and all  deposits  (general or  special,  time or
demand,  provisional  or final) at any time held and other  indebtedness  at any
time owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the account of any  Borrower and
any  property  of any  Borrower  from time to time in  possession  of such Bank,
irrespective of whether or not any Bank shall have made any demand hereunder and
although such  obligations  may be contingent and  unmatured.  The rights of the
Banks under this  Section  8.2(c) are in addition to other  rights and  remedies
(including,  without  limitation,  other  rights of setoff)  which the Banks may

of any Letter of Credit then  outstanding  but not drawn upon shall be deemed to
be then due and owing.  Amounts  distributable to any of the Banks on account of
such Bank  Obligations  under  such  Letter of Credit  shall be  deposited  in a
separate  interest  bearing  collateral  account  in the name of and  under  the
control of the Agent and held by the Agent first as security  for such Letter of
Credit Bank  Obligations and then as security for all other Bank Obligations and
the  amount  so  deposited  shall  be  applied  to the  Letter  of  Credit  Bank
Obligations  at such times and to the  extent  that such  Letter of Credit  Bank
Obligations become absolute liabilities. If and to the extent that the Letter of
Credit Bank Obligations fail to become absolute Bank Obligations  because of the
expiration or  termination  of the  underlying  Letters of Credit  without being
drawn upon, then such amounts shall be applied to the remaining Bank Obligations
in the order provided in Section 8.3. Each Borrower  hereby grants to the Agent,
for the  benefit of the Banks,  a lien and  security  interest in all such funds
deposited in such separate interest bearing collateral  account, as security for
all the Bank Obligations as set forth above. The Borrowers acknowledge and agree
that all  reimbursement  and other  obligations and liabilities  pursuant to any
Letters  of  Credit  issued by the Agent for the  account  of any  Borrower  are
secured by all Collateral and the Security Documents.

SECTION 9. The Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Banks.

9.1 Appointment; Nature of Relationship. The First National Bank of Chicago
is hereby appointed by the Banks as the administrative agent hereunder and under
each other Loan Document, and each of the Banks irrevocably authorizes the Agent
to act as the contractual representative of such Bank with the rights and duties
expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  The Agent agrees to
act as such contractual  representative upon the express conditions contained in
this  Section 9.  Notwithstanding  the use of the  defined  term  "Agent," it is
expressly  understood  and agreed  that the Agent  shall not have any  fiduciary
responsibilities  to any Bank by reason  of this  Agreement  or any  other  Loan
Document and that the Agent is merely acting as the  representative of the Banks
with only those  duties as are  expressly  set forth in this  Agreement  and the
other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Banks' contractual  representative,
the Agent (i) does not hereby assume any  fiduciary  duties to any of the Banks,
(ii) is a  "representative"  of the Banks within the meaning of Section 9-105 of
the Uniform  Commercial  Code and (iii) is acting as an independent  contractor,
the rights and duties of which are limited to those  expressly set forth in this
Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents.  Each of the Banks  hereby  agrees to
assert no claim  against the Agent on any agency  theory or any other  theory of
liability  for breach of  fiduciary  duty,  all of which claims each Bank hereby
waives.

9.2 Powers.  The Agent shall have and may  exercise  such powers  under the
Loan Documents as are  specifically  delegated to the Agent by the terms of each
thereof,  together with such powers as are reasonably  incidental  thereto.  The
Agent shall have no implied duties to the Banks,  or any obligation to the Banks
to take any action  thereunder  except any action  specifically  provided by the
Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

9.3 General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrowers, any Borrower, the Banks or
any Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them  hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or in connection  herewith or therewith except for
its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

9.4 No Responsibility for Loans,  Recitals,  etc. Neither the Agent nor any
of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have
any duty to ascertain,  inquire into, or verify (i) any  statement,  warranty or
representation  made in  connection  with any  Loan  Document  or any  borrowing
hereunder;  (ii)  the  performance  or  observance  of any of the  covenants  or
agreements  of  any  obligor  under  any  Loan  Document,   including,   without
limitation,  any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Bank;  (iii) the  satisfaction  of any  condition  specified  in Section  3.2 or
otherwise   hereunder;   (iv)  the  validity,   enforceability,   effectiveness,
sufficiency  or  genuineness  of any Loan  Document or any other  instrument  or


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 33


<PAGE>



writing furnished  in  connection  therewith;  or (v) the  value,  sufficiency,
creation, perfection or priority of any interest in any collateral security. The
Agent  shall  have no duty to  disclose  to the  Banks  information  that is not
required to be  furnished  by the  Borrowers  to the Agent at such time,  but is
voluntarily  furnished by the  Borrowers to the Agent (either in its capacity as
Agent or in its individual capacity).

9.5 Action on Instructions of Banks.  The Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other
Loan Document in  accordance  with written  instructions  signed by the Required
Banks,  and such  instructions  and any action  taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto  shall be binding on all of the Banks and on all  holders of Notes.  The
Banks  hereby  acknowledge  that  the  Agent  shall be under no duty to take any
discretionary  action  permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of
this  Agreement  or any other  Loan  Document  unless it shall be  requested  in
writing to do so by the Required  Banks.  The Agent shall be fully  justified in
failing  or  refusing  to take any  action  hereunder  and under any other  Loan
Document  unless it shall first be indemnified to its  satisfaction by the Banks
pro rata  against any and all  liability,  cost and expense that it may incur by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

9.6  Employment  of Agents and  Counsel.  The Agent may  execute any of its
duties  as Agent  hereunder  and under any other  Loan  Document  by or  through
employees,  agents,  and  attorneys-in-fact  and shall not be  answerable to the
Banks, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents,
for the default or misconduct of any such agents or  attorneys-in-fact  selected
by it with  reasonable  care.  The Agent  shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning  all matters  pertaining to the agency hereby  created and its duties
hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

9.7  Reliance on  Documents;  Counsel.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any  Note,  notice,  consent,  certificate,  affidavit,  letter,  telegram,
statement,  paper or  document  believed  by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been  signed or sent by the proper  Person or  Persons,  and, in respect to
legal matters,  upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

9.8 Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Banks agree to reimburse
and indemnify the Agent  ratably in proportion to their  respective  Commitments
(or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments
immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the
Borrowers  for which the Agent is entitled  to  reimbursement  by the  Borrowers
under the Loan Documents,  (ii) for any other expenses  incurred by the Agent on
behalf of the Banks, in connection with the  preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration  and  enforcement  of  the  Loan  Documents  and  (iii)  for  any
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted  against the Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document  delivered in connection
therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of
the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Bank shall be
liable  for any of the  foregoing  to the  extent  they  arise  from  the  gross
negligence or willful  misconduct  of the Agent.  The  obligations  of the Banks
under  this  Section  9.8 shall  survive  payment  of the Bank  Obligations  and
termination of this Agreement.

9.9 Notice of Default.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have  knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the
Agent has received  written  notice from a Bank or a Borrower  referring to this
Agreement  describing  such  Default or Event of Default and  stating  that such
notice is a "notice of  default".  In the event that the Agent  receives  such a
notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks.

9.10  Rights as a Bank.  In the event the Agent is a Bank,  the Agent shall
have the same rights and powers  hereunder  and under any other Loan Document as


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 34


<PAGE>



any Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term
"Bank"  or  "Banks"  shall,  at any time when the  Agent is a Bank,  unless  the
context otherwise indicates,  include the Agent in its individual capacity.  The
Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally  engage in any kind
of trust, debt, equity or other  transaction,  in addition to those contemplated
by this Agreement or any other Loan Document,  with any Borrower or any of their
respective  Subsidiaries  in  which  any  Borrower  or  such  Subsidiary  is not
restricted  hereby  from  engaging  with any other  Person.  The  Agent,  in its
individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Bank.

9.11  Bank  Credit   Decision.   Each  Bank   acknowledges   that  it  has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank and based on
the financial  statements prepared by the Borrowers and such other documents and
information  as it has  deemed  appropriate,  made its own credit  analysis  and
decision to enter into this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents.  Each Bank
also  acknowledges  that it will,  independently  and without  reliance upon the
Agent or any other Bank and based on such documents and  information as it shall
deem  appropriate  at the time,  continue  to make its own credit  decisions  in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

9.12  Successor  Agent.  The Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrowers,  such resignation to be effective
upon the  appointment  of a successor  Agent or, if no successor  Agent has been
appointed,  forty-five  days  after  the  retiring  Agent  gives  notice  of its
intention to resign.  Upon any such  resignation,  the Required Banks shall have
the right to  appoint,  on behalf of the  Borrowers  and the Banks,  a successor
Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks
within thirty days after the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to
resign,  then the resigning Agent may appoint,  on behalf of the Borrowers,  and
the Banks, a successor  Agent.  If the Agent has resigned and no successor Agent
has been appointed,  the Banks may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder
and the Borrowers shall make all payments in respect of the Bank  Obligations to
the  applicable  Bank and for all other  purposes  shall deal  directly with the
Banks. No successor  Agent shall be deemed to be appointed  hereunder until such
successor Agent has accepted the appointment.  Any such successor Agent shall be
a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least  $50,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor  Agent,
such successor Agent shall  thereupon  succeed to and become vested with all the
rights,  powers,  privileges  and  duties  of  the  resigning  Agent.  Upon  the
effectiveness  of the  resignation  of the Agent,  the resigning  Agent shall be
discharged  from  its  duties  and  obligations  hereunder  and  under  the Loan
Documents.  After  the  effectiveness  of  the  resignation  of  an  Agent,  the
provisions  of this  Section 9 shall  continue in effect for the benefit of such
Agent in respect of any actions  taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

9.13 Pro Rata  Sharing by Banks.  Each Bank  agrees  with every  other Bank
that,  in the event that it shall  receive  and retain any payment on account of
the  Borrower's  obligations  under this  Agreement,  the Notes or the  Security
Documents in a greater  proportion than that received by any other Bank, whether
such payment be voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, by application of
set-off of any indebtedness or otherwise, then such Bank shall promptly purchase
a participation interest from the other Banks, without recourse, for cash and at
face value,  ratably in  accordance  with its Pro Rata Share,  in such an amount
that each Bank shall have  received  payment in respect of such  obligations  in
accordance with its Pro Rata Share; provided,  that if any such purchase be made
by any Bank and if any such excess payment  relating thereto or any part thereof
is thereafter  recovered from such Bank,  appropriate  adjustment in the related
purchase from the other Banks shall be made by rescission and restoration of the
purchase  price as to the portion of such  excess  payment so  recovered.  It is
further  agreed that,  to the extent there is then owing by the Borrowers to any
Bank indebtedness other than that evidenced by this Agreement, the Notes and the
Security  Documents  to which such Bank may apply any  involuntary  payments  of
indebtedness by the Borrowers, including those resulting from exercise of rights


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 35


<PAGE>



of  set-off  or  similar  rights,  such Bank  shall  apply all such  involuntary
payments first to obligations of the Borrowers to the Banks  hereunder and under
the Notes and the Security Documents and then to such other indebtedness owed to
it by the Borrowers. In addition, it is further agreed that any and all proceeds
resulting  from a sale or  other  disposition  of any  collateral  which  may be
hereafter  granted for the benefit of the Banks to secure the obligations of the
Borrowers  hereunder,  shall be applied first to obligations of the Borrowers to
the Banks  hereunder  and under the Notes and the Security  Documents,  and then
ratably to any other  indebtedness  owed by the  Borrowers to the Banks which is
secured by such collateral.

9.14  Determination  of Borrowing  Base, Etc. (a) As of the Effective Date,
the  Borrowing  Base  shall be  equal  to  $162,500,000  and  scheduled  monthly
reductions  to the  Borrowing  Base shall be $0 (any monthly  reductions  in the
Borrowing Base  redetermined  at any time under this Section 9.14 are defined as
the "Monthly Borrowing Base Reductions").

(b)  Any  redetermination  of  the  Borrowing  Base  and  the  Monthly
Borrowing Base Reductions shall be made by the Agent and submitted to the Banks.
Such  redetermined  Borrowing Base and Monthly  Borrowing Base Reductions  shall
then be  effective  when  approved  by Banks  holding  not less  than 75% of the
aggregate  principal  amount of the  Advances  then  outstanding  (or 75% of the
Commitments if no Advances are then  outstanding).  If any of such  redetermined
Borrowing Base and Monthly  Borrowing Base  Reductions are not approved by Banks
holding not less than 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then
outstanding  (or 75% of the  Commitments  if no Advances  are then  outstanding)
within  ten (10) days  after they are  submitted  to the Banks,  each Bank shall
submit to the Agent,  on or within ten (10) days  after the Agent  notifies  the
Banks that such Banks have not approved any such redetermined  Borrowing Base or
Monthly  Borrowing Base Reductions,  its  determination of each of the foregoing
which was not so approved,  and the redetermined amount of each of the foregoing
which  was  not so  approved  will  be  based  on the  weighted  average  of the
redetermined   amount  thereof  of  each  Bank  which   properly   submits  such
redetermination to the Agent, weighted according to each Bank's Commitment.

NOTWITHSTANDING  ANYTHING  HEREIN TO THE  CONTRARY,  WITHOUT  THE PRIOR  WRITTEN
APPROVAL OF ALL THE BANKS,  SUCH APPROVAL TO BE IN EACH BANK'S SOLE  DISCRETION,
(1) THE BORROWING BASE MAY NOT BE GREATER THAN $162,500,000 AT ANY TIME, (2) THE
REDETERMINATION  OF THE BORROWING BASE AND THE MONTHLY BORROWING BASE REDUCTIONS
SCHEDULED TO OCCUR ON OR ABOUT OCTOBER, 1999 SHALL BE EFFECTIVE WHEN APPROVED BY
ALL OF THE BANKS AND (3) THE MONTHLY BORROWING BASE REDUCTIONS DETERMINED AT ANY
TIME AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ABOVE PROCEDURE MAY NOT BE MODIFIED.

(c) The Borrowing Base and the Monthly  Borrowing Base  Reductions may
be  redetermined  from time to time as requested by the Required Banks (provided
that the Required Banks may not request any such optional  redetermination until
after the mandatory redetermination scheduled to occur on or about October, 1999
unless any representation or warranty contained in Section 6 hereof shall not be
true and  correct in all  material  respects  at any time as if made at any such
time), and will be redetermined upon the request of the Borrowers (provided that
the Borrowers  cannot request a  redetermination  of the Borrowing  Base, or the
Monthly   Borrowing  Base  Reductions  more  than  once  between  the  mandatory
redeterminations  hereinafter  provided for),  and, in addition,  at least twice
each year (provided that the first such redetermination  shall not be made until
October,  1999) as follows:  upon receipt of the reserve reports  referred to in
Section  7.1(d)(vii)  hereof  (and  in  connection  with  such  twice  per  year
redeterminations of the Borrowing Base and the Monthly Borrowing Base Reductions
the Agent shall submit the redetermined Borrowing Base and the Monthly Borrowing
Base Reductions as required under this Section 9.14 on or prior to 30 days after
the receipt of each (i) reserve report  referred to in Section  7.1(d)(vii)  (A)


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 36


<PAGE>



hereof and (ii)  reserve  report  referred to in Section  7.1(d)(vii)(B)).  Each
redetermination  of the Monthly  Borrowing Base Reductions  shall determine such
reductions for each of the six months following such  determination.  Except for
the scheduled  redeterminations  of the Borrowing Base and the Monthly Borrowing
Base Reductions,  each Bank requesting a  redetermination  of the Borrowing Base
and the Monthly Borrowing Base Reductions agrees to give notice to the Agent and
the Borrowers of such request.

(d) Within  five days after  notification  to  Borrower of a Borrowing
Base  redetermination  pursuant to the  provisions  of this  Section  9.14,  the
Borrowers may notify Agent as to what portion of the Borrowing  Base they desire
access (the "Elected  Borrowing  Limit").  Thereafter,  the Borrowers may obtain
Advances which do not exceed in the aggregate the lesser of (i) the  Commitments
or  (ii)  the   Elected   Borrowing   Limit  until  the  next   Borrowing   Base
redetermination,  subject to the provisions of Section 9.14(b) and (c) above. If
no such  notification is received by the Agent the Elected Borrowing Limit shall
be the Borrowing Base as so determined.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the
contrary,  the  Elected  Borrowing  Limit may not  exceed  the lesser of (A) the
Borrowing Base or (B) the aggregate stated Commitment  amounts for the Banks set
forth  next  to the  names  of  the  Banks  on the  signature  pages  hereof  or
established  pursuant to Section 10.6, as the case may be, as such amount may be
reduced from time to time. As of the Effective Date, the Elected Borrowing Limit
shall be equal to $162,500,000.

9.15 Syndication and Documentation Agent.  Toronto Dominion (Texas),  Inc.,
as Syndication Agent hereunder,  and Paribas,  as Documentation Agent hereunder,
shall have no duties or liabilities hereunder in such capacities.

SECTION 10. Miscellaneous.

10.1  Amendments;  Etc. (a) This Agreement and any term or provision hereof
may be amended, waived or terminated by an instrument in writing executed by the
Borrowers and the Required Banks,  and to the extent any rights or duties of the
Agent may be  affected  thereby,  the  Agent,  provided,  that,  notwithstanding
anything in this  Agreement to the contrary,  except by an instrument in writing
executed by the Borrowers  and all of the Banks,  no such  amendment,  waiver or
termination  shall  authorize  or permit the  extension  of the time or times of
payment of the  principal  of, or  interest  on, the Notes or the  reduction  in
principal  amount thereof or the rate of interest  thereon,  or any fees payable
hereunder,  or increase or extend the aggregate  Commitments  or the  respective
Commitments  of any  Bank,  or  change  the  percentage  of Banks  required  for
approvals of the  Borrowing  Base as specified in Section  9.14,  or release any
Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document,
or release any material amount of the Collateral from the Liens granted pursuant
hereto or the Security Documents, or amend this Section 10.1.

(b) Any such amendment,  waiver or termination shall be effective only
in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Bank that has
failed to fund any  Advance or other  amount  required to be funded by such Bank
hereunder  shall not be entitled to vote  (whether to consent or to withhold its
consent) with respect to any amendment,  modification,  termination or waiver of
any  provision of any Loan  Document or a departure  therefrom or any  direction
from the Banks to the Agent and, for purposes of determining the Required Banks,
the Commitments and Advances of such Bank shall be disregarded.

10.2 Notices.  (a) Except as otherwise  provided in Section 10.2(c) hereof,
all notices,  requests,  consents and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be delivered or sent to the Borrowers, the Banks and the Agent
at the respective addresses for notices set forth on the signature pages hereof,
or to such other address as may be designated by the Borrowers, the Agent or any
Bank by notice to the other parties hereto.  All notices shall be deemed to have
been given at the time of actual delivery thereof to such address, or if sent by


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 37


<PAGE>



the Agent or any Bank to the Borrowers by certified or registered mail,  postage
prepaid, to such address, on the fifth day after the date of mailing.

(b) Notices by the Borrowers to the Agent with respect to requests for
Advances  pursuant to Section 3.1 and notices of prepayment  pursuant to Section
4.1(c) shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrowers.

(c) Any notice to be given by the  Borrowers to the Agent  pursuant to
Section  4.1(c) or  Section  3.1 and any  notice to be given by the Agent or any
Bank hereunder, may be given by telephone, by telex or by facsimile transmission
and must be immediately  confirmed in writing in the manner  provided in Section
10.2(a).  Any such notice given by  telephone,  telex or facsimile  transmission
shall be deemed  effective upon receipt thereof by the party to whom such notice
is given.

10.3 Conduct No Waiver;  Remedies  Cumulative.  No course of dealing on the
part of the  Agent or the  Banks,  nor any delay or  failure  on the part of the
Agent or any Bank in exercising any right,  power or privilege  hereunder  shall
operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege or otherwise prejudice the
Agent's or the Banks'  rights and  remedies  hereunder;  nor shall any single or
partial  exercise  thereof preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right,  power or privilege.  No right or remedy  conferred  upon or
reserved  to the Agent or the Banks  under  this  Agreement  is  intended  to be
exclusive  of any other  right or remedy,  and every  right and remedy  shall be
cumulative and in addition to every other right or remedy given hereunder or now
or hereafter  existing under any applicable law. Every right and remedy given by
this  Agreement or by applicable  law to the Agent or the Banks may be exercised
from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by them.

10.4 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions.  All terms, covenants,
agreements,  representations  and  warranties of the Borrowers made herein or in
any certificate or other document  delivered  pursuant hereto shall be deemed to
be  material  and to have been  relied  upon by the Banks,  notwithstanding  any
investigation  heretofore or hereafter made by any Bank or on any Bank's behalf,
and those  covenants  and  agreements of the Borrowers set forth in Section 10.5
hereof shall survive the repayment in full of the Advances and other obligations
of the Borrowers  hereunder and under Security  Documents and the termination of
the Commitments.

10.5 Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Borrowers agree to pay and save the
Agent  harmless  from  liability  for the  payment  of the  reasonable  fees and
expenses  of any  counsel  the  Agent  shall  employ,  in  connection  with  the
preparation,  execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement,  the  Notes  and the
Security Documents and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby
and in connection with any amendments,  waivers or consents and other matters in
connection therewith, and all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the
Banks (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any
enforcement of this Agreement, the Notes or the Security Documents.

(b)  Each of the  Borrowers  hereby  indemnifies  and  agrees  to hold
harmless  the Banks and the Agent,  and their  respective  officers,  directors,
employees  and agents,  from and against  any and all claims,  damages,  losses,
liabilities,  costs or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever which the Banks
or the Agent or any such Person may incur or which may be claimed against any of
them by reason of or in  connection  with any Letter of Credit,  and neither any
Bank nor the Agent or any of their respective officers, directors,  employees or
agents shall be liable or responsible  for: (i) the use which may be made of any
Letter of Credit or for any acts or omissions of any  beneficiary  in connection
therewith; (ii) the validity,  sufficiency or genuineness of documents or of any
endorsement thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or
all respects invalid,  insufficient,  fraudulent or forged; (iii) payment by the
Agent to the  beneficiary  under any Letter of Credit  against  presentation  of
documents which do not comply with the terms of any Letter of Credit,  including

CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 38


<PAGE>





failure of any  documents to bear any  reference  or adequate  reference to such
Letter  of  Credit;  (iv)  any  error,   omission,   interruption  or  delay  in
transmission,   dispatch  or   delivery  of  any  message  or  advice,   however
transmitted,  in connection with any Letter of Credit; or (v) any other event or
circumstance  whatsoever  arising  in  connection  with any  Letter  of  Credit;
provided,  however,  that the  Borrowers  shall not be required to indemnify the
Agent and such other Persons,  and the Agent shall be liable to the Borrowers to
the extent,  but only to the extent,  of any direct, as opposed to consequential
or  incidental,  damages  suffered by any Borrower  which were caused by (A) the
Agent's  wrongful  dishonor of any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it
by the  beneficiary  thereunder of a draft or other demand for payment and other
documentation strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of
Credit,  or (B) the payment by the Agent to the beneficiary  under any Letter of
Credit against  presentation  of documents which do not comply with the terms of
the Letter of Credit to the extent,  but only to the extent,  that such  payment
constitutes gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent. It is understood
that in making  any  payment  under a Letter of  Credit  the Agent  will rely on
documents  presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters
set forth therein without further  investigation and regardless of any notice or
information  to the contrary,  and such reliance and payment  against  documents
presented  under a Letter  of  Credit  substantially  complying  with the  terms
thereof shall not be deemed gross  negligence or wilful  misconduct of the Agent
in connection with such payment.  It is further  acknowledged  and agreed that a
Borrower may have rights against the  beneficiary  or others in connection  with
any Letter of Credit with respect to which the Agent is alleged to be liable and
it shall be a precondition  of the assertion of any liability of the Agent under
this  Section  that such  Borrower  shall first have taken  reasonable  steps to
enforce remedies in respect of the alleged loss against such beneficiary and any
other parties  obligated or liable in connection  with such Letter of Credit and
any related transactions.

(c) In  consideration  of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by  each  Bank  and the  extension  of the  Commitments,  the  Borrowers  hereby
indemnify,  exonerate and hold the Agent, each Bank and each of their respective
officers,  directors,  employees  and  agents  (collectively,  the  "Indemnified
Parties")  free and  harmless  from and against any and all  actions,  causes of
action, suits, losses, costs,  liabilities and damages, and expenses incurred in
connection  therewith  (irrespective of whether any such Indemnified  Party is a
party to the action for which  indemnification  hereunder is sought),  including
reasonable  attorneys' fees and  disbursements  (collectively,  the "Indemnified
Liabilities"),  incurred by the  Indemnified  Parties or any of them as a result
of, or arising out of, or relating to:

(i) any  transaction  financed  or to be  financed in whole or in
part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Advance;

(ii) the entering into and  performance of this Agreement and any
other  agreement or  instrument  executed in  connection  herewith by any of the
Indemnified  Parties  (including  any  action  brought  by or on  behalf  of the
Borrowers as the result of any  determination  by the Required Banks not to fund
any Advance in compliance with this Agreement);

(iii) any investigation,  litigation or proceeding related to any
acquisition   or  proposed   acquisition  by  the  Borrowers  or  any  of  their
Subsidiaries of any portion of the stock or assets of any Person, whether or not
the Agent or such Bank is party thereto;

(iv) any  investigation,  litigation or proceeding related to any
environmental cleanup, audit, compliance or other matter relating to any release
by the Borrowers or any of their  Subsidiaries of any hazardous  material or any
violations of Environmental Laws; or

(v) the presence on or under,  or the escape,  seepage,  leakage,
spillage, discharge,  emission,  discharging or releases from, any real property
owned or operated by the  Borrowers or any  Subsidiary  thereof of any Hazardous
Material (including any losses,  liabilities,damages,  injuries, costs, expenses


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 39


<PAGE>



or claims  asserted  or arising  under any  Environmental  Law),  regardless  of
whether  caused by, or within the control of, the Borrowers or such  Subsidiary,
except  for any  such  Indemnified  Liabilities  arising  for the  account  of a
particular  Indemnified  Party by reason of the  activities  of the  Indemnified
Party on the property of the Borrowers conducted  subsequent to a foreclosure on
such  property  by the Banks or by reason of the  relevant  Indemnified  Party's
gross negligence or wilful misconduct or breach of this Agreement, and if and to
the extent that the foregoing  undertaking may be unenforceable  for any reason,
the Borrowers  hereby agree to make the maximum  contribution to the payment and
satisfaction of each of the Indemnified  Liabilities  which is permissible under
applicable  law. The Borrowers  shall be obligated to indemnify the  Indemnified
Parties for all Indemnified Liabilities subject to and pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, regardless of whether the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries had
knowledge  of the  facts  and  circumstances  giving  rise to  such  Indemnified
Liability.

10.6  Successors and Assigns.  (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their  respective  successors and
assigns,  provided that the Borrowers may not,  without the prior consent of the
Banks,  assign their rights or obligations  hereunder or under the Notes and the
Banks shall not be obligated  to make any Advance  hereunder to any entity other
than the Borrowers.

(b) Any  Bank  may  sell a  participation  interest  to any  financial
institution or institutions,  and such financial institution or institutions may
further sell, a participation  interest  (undivided or divided) in, the Advances
and such Bank's  rights and  benefits  under this  Agreement,  the Notes and the
Security Documents and to the extent of that participation,  such participant or
participants shall have the same rights and benefits against the Borrowers under
Section 6.2(c) as it or they would have had if participation of such participant
or  participants  were the Bank making the Advances to the Borrowers  hereunder,
provided,  however,  that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall
remain  unmodified and fully effective and  enforceable  against such Bank, (ii)
such Bank shall remain solely  responsible  to the other parties  hereto for the
performance of such obligations,  (iii) such Bank shall remain the holder of its
Note for all purposes of this Agreement,  (iv) the Borrowers,  the Agent and the
other  Banks  shall  continue  to deal  solely  and  directly  with such Bank in
connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (v)
such Bank shall not grant to its  participant  any rights to consent or withhold
consent to any action taken by such Bank or the Agent under this Agreement other
than action requiring the consent of all of the Banks hereunder.  The Agent from
time to time in its sole  discretion  may  appoint  agents  for the  purpose  of
servicing and  administering  this Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated
hereby and enforcing or exercising  any rights or remedies of the Agent provided
under this Agreement,  the Notes,  or otherwise.  In furtherance of such agency,
the Agent may from  time to time  direct  that the  Borrowers  provide  notices,
reports  and other  documents  contemplated  by this  Agreement  (or  duplicates
thereof) to such agent.  The Borrowers hereby consent to the appointment of such
agent and agree to provide all such notices,  reports and other documents and to
otherwise  deal with such agent acting on behalf of the Agent in the same manner
as would be required if dealing with the Agent itself.

(c) Each Bank may,  with the prior  consent  of the  Borrowers  (which
consent  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld and shall not be required upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default which is not cured
or  waived  within 30 days (or 0 days in the case of an Event of  Default  under
Section  8.1(g))  after  the  occurrence  of such  Event of  Default  or if such
assignment  by such Bank is to an Affiliate of such Bank or to another Bank) and
the Agent, assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including,  without limitation, all
or a portion of its  Commitment,  the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes
and the Security  Documents held by it); provided,  however,  that (i) each such
assignment  shall be of a uniform,  and not a varying,  percentage of all rights
and  obligations,  (ii) except in the case of an  assignment  of all of a Bank's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, (A) the amount of the Commitment of

the assigning Bank being assigned  pursuant to each such assignment  (determined
as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment)
shall  in no  event  be less  than  $5,000,000,  and in  integral  multiples  of
$1,000,000 thereafter,  or such lesser amount as the Borrowers and the Agent may
consent to and (B) after giving  effect to each such  assignment,  the amount of
the Commitment of the assigning Bank shall in no event be less than  $5,000,000,
and (iii) the parties to each such  assignment  shall execute and deliver to the
Agent,  for its  acceptance  and  recording in the Register,  an Assignment  and
Acceptance  in the form of Exhibit D hereto (an  "Assignment  and  Acceptance"),
together with any Note or Notes subject to such  assignment and a processing and
recordation  fee of  $3,500.  Upon  such  execution,  delivery,  acceptance  and
recording,  from and after the effective date  specified in such  Assignment and
Acceptance,  (x) the  assignee  thereunder  shall be a party  hereto and, to the
extent that rights and  obligations  hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such  Assignment and  Acceptance,  have the rights and  obligations of a Bank
hereunder and (y) the Bank assignor  thereunder shall, to the extent that rights
and  obligations  hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of
the remaining  portion of an assigning Bank's rights and obligations  under this
Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

(d) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Bank
assignor  thereunder and the assignee  thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:  (i) other than as provided in
such Assignment and Acceptance,  such assigning Bank makes no  representation or
warranty  and  assumes  no  responsibility   with  respect  to  any  statements,
warranties or  representations  made in or in connection  with this Agreement or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished  pursuant
hereto; (ii) such assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and assumes
no  responsibility  with respect to the financial  condition of the Borrowers or
the performance or observance by the Borrowers of any of their obligations under
this Agreement or any other  instrument or document  furnished  pursuant hereto;
(iii) such  assignee  confirms  that it has  received a copy of this  Agreement,
together with copies of the financial  statements referred to in Section 6.7 and
such other  documents and  information as it has deemed  appropriate to make its
own credit  analysis and decision to enter into such  Assignment and Acceptance;
(iv) such assignee will,  independently  and without reliance on the Agent, such
assigning Bank or any other Bank and based on such documents and  information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
in taking or not taking action under this Agreement;  (v) such assignee appoints
and  authorizes  the Agent to take such  action  as agent on its  behalf  and to
exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms  hereof,  together  with such  powers and  discretion  as are
reasonably  incidental  thereto;  and (vi)  such  assignee  agrees  that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations  that by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank.

(e)  The  Agent  shall  maintain  at  its  address  designated  on the
signature pages hereof a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it and a register for the  recordation of the names and addresses of
the Banks and the Commitment of, and principal  amount of the Advances owing to,
each Bank from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall
be  conclusive  and binding for all purposes,  absent  manifest  error,  and the
Borrowers,  the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the  Register as a Bank  hereunder  for all purposes of this  Agreement.  The
Register  shall be available for  inspection by the Borrowers or any Bank at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(f) Upon its receipt of an Assignment  and  Acceptance  executed by an
assigning Bank and an assignee,  together with any Note or Notes subject to such
assignment,  the  Agent  shall,  if such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  has  been
completed,   (i)  accept  such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,   (ii)  record  the
information  contained  therein in the  Register  and (iii) give  prompt  notice
thereof to the  Borrowers.  Within five  Business Days after its receipt of such
notice,  the Borrowers,  at their own expense,  shall execute and deliver to the


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 41


<PAGE>



Agent in exchange for the  surrendered  Note or Notes a new Note to the order of
such  assignee in an amount  equal to the  Commitment  assumed by it pursuant to
such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  and,  if the  assigning  Bank has  retained a
Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Bank in an amount
equal to the Commitment  retained by it hereunder.  Such new Note or Notes shall
be in an aggregate  principal amount equal to the aggregate  principal amount of
such  surrendered  Note or  Notes,  shall be dated  the  effective  date of such
Assignment and Acceptance and shall  otherwise be in  substantially  the form of
Exhibit B hereto.

(g) The Banks may, in connection with any assignment or  participation
or proposed assignment or participation  pursuant to this Section 10.6, disclose
to the  assignee  or  participant  or  proposed  assignee  or  participant,  any
information  relating to the Borrowers,  provided that such proposed assignee or
participant  has agreed to hold such  information  confidential  under the terms
described in Section 10.20.

(h)  Notwithstanding any other provisions set forth in this Agreement,
any Bank may at any time create a security  interest  in, or assign,  all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including,  without limitation,  the
Advances  owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any  Federal
Reserve Bank in  accordance  with  Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal  Reserve System;  provided that such creation of a security  interest or
assignment  shall  not  release  such  Bank  from  its  obligations  under  this
Agreement.

10.7  Subsidiaries  as  Borrowers.  In the  event  that CRI,  COG,  COGL or
Offshore shall create or acquire a Subsidiary,  such Subsidiary  shall execute a
joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent, together with
such  Security  Documents,  other  documents  and  opinions  as  the  Agent  may
reasonably require, and shall become a Borrower hereunder.

10.8  CHOICE OF LAW.  THE LOAN  DOCUMENTS  (OTHER THAN THOSE  CONTAINING  A
CONTRARY  EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF  CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,  BUT
GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

10.9 Table of Contents and Headings. The table of contents and the headings
of the various subdivisions hereof are for the convenience of reference only and
shall in no way modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

10.10  Construction  of  Certain  Provisions.   All  computations  required
hereunder  and all  financial  terms used herein  shall be made or  construed in
accordance  with GAAP unless such principles are  inconsistent  with the express
requirements of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement refers to any
action  to be taken by any  Person,  or which  such  Person is  prohibited  from
taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly
or  indirectly  by such  Person,  whether  or not  expressly  specified  in such
provision.

10.11  Integration  and  Severability.  This Agreement  embodies the entire
agreement and understanding  between the Borrowers and the Banks, and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings,  relating to the subject matter hereof.
In  case  any  one or  more  of the  obligations  of the  Borrowers  under  this
Agreement,  the Notes or any  Security  Documents  shall be invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction,  the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining  obligations of the Borrowers  shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby,  and such invalidity,  illegality or  unenforceability  in one
jurisdiction  shall not affect the validity,  legality or  enforceability of the
obligations  of the Borrowers  under this  Agreement,  the Notes or any Security
Documents in any other jurisdiction.

10.12  Interest Rate  Limitation.  Notwithstanding  any  provisions of this
Agreement,  the Notes or any Security Documents, in no event shall the amount of
interest paid or agreed to be paid by the Borrowers exceed an amount computed at
the highest  rate of interest  permissible  under  applicable  law. If, from any
circumstances  whatsoever,  fulfillment of any provision of this Agreement,  the
Notes or any Security  Documents at the time performance of such provision shall
be due, shall involve exceeding the interest rate limitation  validly prescribed
by law which a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then,
ipso  facto,  the  obligations  to be  fulfilled  shall be  reduced to an amount
computed at the highest rate of interest  permissible  under applicable law, and
if for any reason  whatsoever the Banks shall ever receive as interest an amount
which would be deemed  unlawful under such applicable law such interest shall be
automatically  applied to the payment of principal  of the Advances  outstanding
and other  obligations of the Borrowers  hereunder  (whether or not then due and
payable)  and not to the  payment  of  interest,  or  shall be  refunded  to the
Borrowers  if such  principal  has been  paid in full.  Anything  herein  to the
contrary notwithstanding,  the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement
shall be  subject to the  limitation  that  payments  of  interest  shall not be
required  to the extent that  receipt of any such  payment by the Banks would be
contrary to provisions  of law  applicable to the Banks which limits the maximum
rate of interest which may be charged or collected by the Banks.

10.13  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be  executed  in any  number  of
counterparts,  all of which taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
instrument  and any of the parties  hereto may execute this Agreement by signing
any such counterpart.

10.14  Independence  of Covenants.  All covenants  hereunder shall be given
independent  effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted
by any such covenant, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or
would be otherwise  within the limitations of, another  covenant shall not avoid
the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default  or any event or  condition  which with
notice or lapse of time, or both,  could become such an Event of Default if such
action is taken or such condition exists.

10.15  Consent  to  Jurisdiction.   Notwithstanding  the  place  where  any
liability  originates  or  arises,  or is to be  repaid,  any  suit,  action  or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Security Documents,
or the Notes may be  instituted  in any court of competent  jurisdiction  in the
State of Illinois,  each Borrower hereby  irrevocably waives any objection which
it may have or  hereafter  has to the  laying  of such  venue of any such  suit,
action or proceeding and any claim that any such suit,  action or proceeding has
been brought in an  inconvenient  forum,  and each Borrower  hereby  irrevocably
submits  its Person and  property to the  jurisdiction  of any such court in any
such suit, action or proceedings. Nothing in this Section 10.15 shall affect the
right of the Bank to bring  proceedings  against the  Borrowers  or any of their
property in the courts of any other court of competent jurisdiction.

10.16 JURY TRIAL  WAIVER.  THE AGENT,  THE BANKS AND EACH  BORROWER,  AFTER
CONSULTING OR HAVING HAD THE  OPPORTUNITY  TO CONSULT WITH  COUNSEL,  KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT ANY OF THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LITIGATION  BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT,  THE NOTES,
THE SECURITY  DOCUMENTS,  OR ANY RELATED  INSTRUMENT  OR AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS
OR ANY COURSE OF  CONDUCT,  DEALING,  STATEMENTS  (WHETHER  ORAL OR  WRITTEN) OR
ACTIONS OF ANY OF THEM. NEITHER THE AGENT, THE BANKS NOR ANY BORROWER SHALL SEEK
TO CONSOLIDATE,  BY  COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHERWISE,  ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY
TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER  ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL  CANNOT BE OR
HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED.  THESE PROVISIONS SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MODIFIED
IN ANY  RESPECT  OR  RELINQUISHED  BY  EITHER  THE  AGENT  AND THE  BANKS OR THE
BORROWERS EXCEPT BY A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT EXECUTED BY ALL OF THEM.

10.17 Joint and Several Obligations;  Contribution Rights;  Savings Clause.
(a) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any Note or
in any other Loan Document, the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and under
the Notes and the other Loan Documents are joint and several.

(b)  If  any  Borrower   makes  a  payment  in  respect  of  the  Bank
Obligations,  it shall have the rights of  contribution  set forth below against
the other Borrowers; provided that such Borrower shall not exercise its right of
contribution until all the Bank Obligations shall have been finally paid in full
in cash. If any Borrower makes a payment in respect of the Bank Obligations that
is smaller in proportion to its Payment Share (as hereinafter defined) than such
payments  made by the other  Borrowers are in proportion to the amounts of their
respective  Payment  Shares,  the Borrower making such  proportionately  smaller
payment  shall,  when  permitted  by the  preceding  sentence,  pay to the other
Borrowers an amount such that the net  payments  made by the Borrower in respect
of the  Bank  Obligations  shall  be  shared  among  the  Borrowers  pro rata in
proportion to their  respective  Payment  Shares.  If any Borrower  receives any
payment that is greater in proportion  to the amount of its Payment  Shares than
the payments received by the other Borrowers are in proportion to the amounts of
their respective  Payment Shares,  the Borrower  receiving such  proportionately
greater payment shall, when permitted by the second preceding  sentence,  pay to
the other  Borrowers an amount such that the payments  received by the Borrowers
shall be shared among the Borrowers  pro rata in proportion to their  respective
Payment  Shares.  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained  in this
paragraph or in this Agreement,  no liability or obligation of any Borrower that
shall  accrue  pursuant to this  paragraph  shall be paid nor shall it be deemed
owed  pursuant  to this  paragraph  until all of the Bank  Obligations  shall be
finally paid in full in cash.

For purposes hereof,  the "Payment Share" of each Borrower shall be the sum
of (a) the aggregate proceeds of the Bank Obligations  received by such Borrower
plus (b) the product of (i) the aggregate Bank  Obligations  remaining unpaid on
the date such Bank Obligations become due and payable in full, whether by stated
maturity,  acceleration,  or otherwise (the "Determination Date") reduced by the
amount of such Bank Obligations  attributed to all or such Borrowers pursuant to
clause  (a)  above,  times  (ii) a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which is such
Borrower's net worth on the effective  date of this Agreement  (determined as of
the end of the immediately  preceding fiscal reporting period of such Borrower),
and the denominator of which is the aggregate net worth of all Borrowers on such
effective date.

(c) It is the  intent of each  Borrower,  the Agent and the Banks that
each Borrower's maximum Bank Obligations shall be in, but not in excess of:

(i) in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Borrower
under the  Bankruptcy  Code on or within  one year from the date on which any of
the Bank  Obligations are incurred,  the maximum amount that would not otherwise
cause the Bank  Obligations  (or any other  obligations  of such Borrower to the
Agent and the Banks) to be avoidable  or  unenforceable  against  such  Borrower
under  (A)  Section  548 of the  Bankruptcy  Code  or (B) any  state  fraudulent
transfer  or  fraudulent  conveyance  act or  statute  applied  in such  case or
proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code; or

(ii)  in a  case  or  proceeding  commenced  by or  against  such
Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code subsequent to one year from the date on which
any of the Bank  Obligations  are  incurred,  the maximum  amount that would not
otherwise cause the Bank Obligations (or any other  obligations of such Borrower
to the Agent and the  Banks)  to be  avoidable  or  unenforceable  against  such
Borrower  under any state  fraudulent  transfer or fraudulent  conveyance act or
statute  applied in any such case or  proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the
Bankruptcy Code; or

(iii)  in a case  or  proceeding  commenced  by or  against  such
Borrower under any law,  statute or regulation  other than the  Bankruptcy  Code


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 44


<PAGE>



(including,   without   limitation,   any  other   bankruptcy,   reorganization,
arrangement,  moratorium,  readjustment  of debt,  dissolution,  liquidation  or
similar debtor relief laws),  the maximum amount that would not otherwise  cause
the Bank Obligations (or any other obligations of such Borrower to the Agent and
the Banks) to be avoidable or  unenforceable  against such  Borrower  under such
law, statute or regulation including,  without limitation,  any state fraudulent
transfer or  fraudulent  conveyance  act or statute  applied in any such case or
proceeding.

(d) The Borrowers  acknowledge and agree that they have requested that
the Banks make credit available to the Borrowers with each Borrower expecting to
derive  benefit,  directly  and  indirectly,  from the Advances and other credit
extended by the Banks to the Borrowers.

10.18  Consents to Renewals,  Modifications  and Other  Actions and Events.
This  Agreement  and all of the  obligations  of the Borrowers  hereunder  shall
remain in full force and  effect  without  regard to and shall not be  released,
affected or impaired by: (a) any amendment,  assignment,  transfer, modification
of or addition or supplement to the Bank Obligations,  this Agreement,  any Note
or any other Loan Document; (b) any extension,  indulgence, increase in the Bank
Obligations  or other action or inaction in respect of any of the Loan Documents
or otherwise with respect to the Bank Obligations, or any acceptance of security
for, or guaranties  of, any of the Bank  Obligations or Loan  Documents,  or any
surrender,  release, exchange,  impairment or alteration of any such security or
guaranties  including  without  limitation  the  failing  to  perfect a security
interest  in any  such  security  or  abstaining  from  taking  advantage  or of
realizing  upon  any  guaranties  or upon  any  security  interest  in any  such
security;  (c) any default by any Borrower  under, or any lack of due execution,
invalidity or  unenforceability  of, or any irregularity or other defect in, any
of the Loan  Documents;  (d) any waiver by the Banks or any other  Person of any
required  performance  or otherwise of any condition  precedent or waiver of any
requirement  imposed by any of the Loan  Documents,  any guaranties or otherwise
with respect to the Bank  Obligations;  (e) any exercise or  non-exercise of any
right,  remedy,  power or privilege  in respect of this  Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents;  (f) any sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of the
assets of any Borrower or any  consolidation  or merger of any Borrower  with or
into  any  other  Person,  corporation,  or  entity,  or any  transfer  or other
disposition  by any Borrower or any other holder of any shares of Capital  Stock
of any  Borrower;  (g) any  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization  or similar
proceedings involving or affecting any Borrower; (h) the release or discharge of
any Borrower from the performance or observance of any agreement, covenant, term
or condition  under any of the Bank  Obligations or contained in any of the Loan
Documents  by  operation  of law;  or (i) any other  cause  whether  similar  or
dissimilar  to the  foregoing  which,  in the absence of this  provision,  would
release, affect or impair the obligations,  covenants,  agreements and duties of
any Borrower hereunder,  including without limitation any act or omission by the
Agent,  or the Bank or any other any Person  which  increases  the scope of such
Borrower's risk; and in each case described in this paragraph whether or not any
Borrower shall have notice or knowledge of any of the  foregoing,  each of which
is specifically waived by each Borrower. Each Borrower warrants to the Agent and
the Banks that it has  adequate  means to obtain  from each other  Borrower on a
continuing  basis  information  concerning  the  financial  condition  and other
matters with respect to the Borrowers and that it is not relying on the Agent or
the Banks to provide such information either now or in the future.

10.19 Waivers, Etc. Each Borrower unconditionally waives: (a) notice of any
of the matters  referred to in Section 10.18 above; (b) all notices which may be
required  by statute,  rule or law or  otherwise  to preserve  any rights of the
Agent or the Banks including,  without limitation,  presentment to and demand of
payment or performance  from the other  Borrowers and protect for non-payment or
dishonor;  (c) any right to the exercise by the Agent or the Banks of any right,
remedy, power or privilege in connection with any of the Loan Documents; (d) any
requirement  that the  Agent or the  Banks in the  event of any  default  by any
Borrower,  first make  demand  upon or seek to enforce  remedies  against,  such
Borrower or any other  Borrower  before  demanding  payment  under or seeking to
enforce this Agreement  against any other  Borrower;  (f) any right to notice of
the  disposition  of any security which the Agent or the Banks may hold from any


CREDIT AGREEMENT                                                         Page 45


<PAGE>



Borrower or otherwise and any right to object to the  commercial  reasonableness
of the  disposition  of any such  security;  and (g) all errors and omissions in
connection  with the  Agent's  or any Bank's  administration  of any of the Bank
Obligations,  any of the Loan  Documents,  or any other act or  omission  of the
Agent or any Bank which changes the scope of the  Borrower's  risk,  except as a
result of the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of the Agent or any Bank.
The  obligations  of each  Borrower  hereunder  shall be  complete  and  binding
forthwith  upon the  execution  of this  Agreement  and subject to no  condition
whatsoever, precedent or otherwise, and notice of acceptance hereof or action in
reliance hereon shall not be required.

10.20 Confidentiality.  The Banks and the Agent shall hold all confidential
information  obtained  pursuant to the  requirements of this Agreement which has
been  identified  as such by any  Borrower in  accordance  with their  customary
procedures  for  handling  confidential   information  of  this  nature  and  in
accordance  with  safe and  sound  banking  practices  and in any event may make
disclosure to its examiners,  affiliates,  outside  auditors,  counsel and other
professional  advisors  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  or as  reasonably
required by any bona fide  transferee  or  participant  in  connection  with the
contemplated  transfer  of any Note or  participation  therein or as required or
requested by any governmental  agency or  representative  thereof or pursuant to
legal process.  Without limiting the foregoing,  it is expressly understood that
such confidential  information shall not include  information which, at the time
of disclosure is in the public domain or, which after  disclosure,  becomes part
of the public  domain or  information  which any Bank or the Agent had  obtained
prior to the time of disclosure  and  identification  by any Borrower under this
Section  10.20,  or  information  received by any Bank or the Agent from a third
party. Nothing in this Section 10.20 or otherwise shall prohibit any Bank or the
Agent from  disclosing  any  confidential  information to the other Banks or the
Agent or render any of them liable in connection with any such disclosure.

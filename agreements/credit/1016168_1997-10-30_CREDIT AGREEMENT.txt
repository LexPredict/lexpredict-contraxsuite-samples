used herein as so defined).

(2)  The Borrower desires to issue up to $175 million of convertible
subordinated notes due 2002 to several initial purchasers who propose to resell
such notes to "qualified institutional buyers" (as defined in Rule 144A under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) in reliance on Rule 144A, and
institutional "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1),(2),
(3) or (7) under such Securities Act.

(3)  The Borrower, such Agents and the Lenders party hereto desire to amend
certain of the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement in order to permit

below.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:

SECTION 1.  AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT AGREEMENT.

1.1  Indebtedness.  Effective on the Effective Date (as hereinafter
defined), clause (c) of section 8.4 of the Credit Agreement is amended to
include reference to the Convertible Subordinated Notes (as hereinafter
defined), so that as so amended such clause reads in its entirety as follows:

(c)  the following:

(i)  Existing Indebtedness, and any refinancing, extension,
renewal or refunding of any such Existing Indebtedness, provided that
(A) the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness in respect
of Residential Mortgage Bond programs of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (as described in the Registration Statement) currently in
existence is not increased above $50,000,000, and (B) the principal
amount of any other such Existing Indebtedness is not increased:

(ii) the American ElderServe Assumed Debt (including any guaranty
by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of the American ElderServe
Assumed Debt), provided that the entire American ElderServe Assumed
Debt (and any such guaranty), other than the Suburban Lodge Debt (and
any such guaranty in respect thereof), is retired, repaid or prepaid
<PAGE>

in full within 90 days following the date the American ElderServe
Acquisition is completed and not refinanced in whole or in part with
Indebtedness other than Loans made hereunder;

(iii)  Contingent Obligations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries in respect of the American ElderServe Assumed Finance
Lease Obligations covering not more than $25,000,000 of Approved Costs
(as defined in the documents governing the American ElderServe Assumed
Finance Lease Obligations as in effect on the date the American
ElderServe Acquisition is completed); and

(iv)  the Convertible Subordinated Notes; and any refinancing,
extension, renewal or refunding thereof effected in compliance with
the applicable provisions of section 8.7;

1.2.  Prepayments and Refinancings. Effective on the Effective Date, clause
(c) of section 8.7 of the Credit Agreement is redesignated as clause (d) and
clause (b) of section 8.7 of the Credit Agreement is replaced with the following
clauses (b) and (c):

(b) make (or give any notice in respect thereof) any voluntary or
optional payment or prepayment or redemption or acquisition for value of
(including, without limitation, by way of depositing with the trustee with
respect thereto money or securities before due for the purpose of paying
when due) or exchange of, or refinance or refund, any Convertible
Subordinated Notes, or any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness consisting
of the Notes issued hereunder) which has previously refinanced any of the
Convertible Subordinated Notes; provided that the Borrower may refinance
or refund any Convertible Subordinated Notes or any such Indebtedness if
(i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount thereof is not increased,
(ii) the weighted average life to maturity thereof (computed in accordance
with standard financial practice) is not reduced, and (iii) any such
refinancing, extension, renewal or refunding of thereof involves terms of
subordination no less favorable to the Lenders than those originally
applicable to the Convertible Subordinated Notes;

(c) amend or modify (or permit the amendment or modification of) any
of the terms or provisions of or terminate (other than any scheduled
termination in accordance with the terms thereof) (i) in any manner adverse
to the interests of the Lenders any documents or agreement governing any
Existing Indebtedness or the Convertible Subordinated Notes, or (ii) in any
manner that has, or which would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect, any Acquisition Document; and/or

1.3.  Definitions.  Effective on the Effective Date, section 10 of the
Credit Agreement is amended to include the following definition in its
appropriate alphabetic order:

"Convertible Subordinated Notes" shall mean up to $175,000,000
aggregate principal amount of Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2002,
issued by the Borrower as contemplated by the Offering Memorandum dated
September 26, 1997, a true and correct draft of which has been furnished to
the Lenders, provided that the terms of subordination applicable to such
Notes are not changed from the description thereof contained in such draft
in a manner adverse to the interests of the Lenders.

SECTION 2.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

The Borrower represents and warrants as follows:

2.1.  Authorization, Validity and Binding Effect.  This Amendment has been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Borrower,

enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.

2.2.  Representations and Warranties True and Correct. The representations
and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Credit Agreement, as amended
hereby, are true and correct on and as of the date hereof as though made on and
as of the date hereof, except to the extent that such representations and
warranties expressly relate to a specified date, in which case such
representations and warranties are hereby reaffirmed as true and correct when
made.

2.3.  No Event of Default, etc. No condition or event has occurred or
exists which constitutes or which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute an Event of Default.

draft of the Offering Memorandum pursuant to which the Convertible Subordinated
Notes are to be offered. The terms of the Convertible Notes as originally issued
will be as described in such draft Offering Memorandum (with blank information
as to interest rate, payment dates, etc, appropriately completed, and any
changes in principal amount not involving an increase in the aggregate principal
amount above $175 million being permitted), but with no changes therein as to
subordination, redemption or maturity matters which are adverse to the Lenders.

Agreement, as well as reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit
issued under the Credit Agreement, and all related obligations in respect of
principal, interest, fees, costs, enforcement expenses and indemnity obligations

Indebtedness" as defined in such Indenture.

SECTION 3. RATIFICATIONS.

supersede all inconsistent terms and provisions set forth in the Credit
Agreement, and except as expressly modified and superseded by this Amendment,
the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement are ratified and confirmed and
shall continue in full force and effect.

SECTION 4. BINDING EFFECT.

This Amendment shall become effective if and when, on a date (the
"Effective Date") on or prior to November 30, 1997, the following conditions
shall have been satisfied:

(a) this Amendment shall have been executed by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Managing Agent and the Documentation Agent, and
counterparts hereof as so executed shall have been delivered to the
Administrative Agent;

(b) the Acknowledgment and Consent appended hereto shall have been
executed by the Credit Parties named therein, and counterparts thereof as

3
<PAGE>

(d) the Borrower shall have completed the initial issuance of the
Convertible Subordinated Notes, without giving effect to any over-allotment
option; and shall have so notified the Administrative Agent thereof;

and thereafter this Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Managing Agent, the Documentation
Agent and each Lender and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
After this Amendment becomes effective, the Managing Agent will promptly
furnish a copy of this Amendment to each Lender and the Borrower and confirm the
specific Effective Date hereof.

SECTION 5.  MISCELLANEOUS.

5.1.  Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made in this Amendment shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Amendment, and no investigation by any Agent or any Lender or any
subsequent Loan or other Credit Event shall affect the representations and
warranties or the right of any Agent or any Lender to rely upon them.

5.2.  Reference to Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement and any and all
other agreements, instruments or documentation now or hereafter executed and
delivered pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement as amended hereby, are
hereby amended so that any reference therein to the Credit Agreement shall mean
a reference to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby.

5.3.  Expenses. As provided in the Credit Agreement, but without limiting
any terms or provisions thereof, the Borrower agrees to pay on demand all costs
and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Managing Agent or the
Documentation Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, and
execution of this Amendment, including without limitation the costs and fees of
the Documentation Agent's and the Administrative Agent's special legal counsel,
regardless of whether this Amendment becomes effective in accordance with the
terms hereof, and all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent,
the Managing Agent, the Documentation Agent or any Lender in connection with the
enforcement or preservation of any rights under the Credit Agreement, as amended
hereby.

5.4.  Severability. Any term or provision of this Amendment held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable shall not impair or
invalidate the remainder of this Amendment and the effect thereof shall be
confined to the term or provision so held to be invalid or unenforceable.

5.5.  Applicable Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

5.6.  Headings. The headings, captions and arrangements used in this
Amendment are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of
this Amendment.

5.7.  Entire Agreement. This Amendment is specifically limited to the
matters expressly set forth herein. This Amendment and all other instruments,
agreements and documentation executed and delivered in connection with this
Amendment embody the final, entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior
commitments, agreements, representations and understandings, whether written or
oral, relating to the matters covered by this Amendment, and may not be
contradicted or varied by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral
agreements or discussions of the parties hereto. There are no oral agreements
among the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof or any other
subject matter relating to the Credit Agreement.

5.8.  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed by the parties hereto
separately in one or more counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement.

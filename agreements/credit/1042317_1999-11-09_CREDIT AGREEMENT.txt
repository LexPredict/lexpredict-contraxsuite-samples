obligation of Parent and each Loan Party thereto, enforceable against

Subsidiary are able to effectively process data including dates before, on

<PAGE>


and after January 1, 2000 without experiencing any year 2000 problem that would
reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect. At the request of the
Agent, the Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided to the Agent with
assurance and substantiation (including, but not limited to, the results of
internal or external audit reports prepared in the ordinary course of business)
reasonably acceptable to the Agent as to the year 2000 capability of Parent, the
Borrower and their Subsidiaries and their ability to conduct their business and
operations before, on and after January 1, 2000 without experiencing a year 2000
problem causing a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes hereof, "year 2000
problem" means the failure of computer-based and other systems or equipment,

recognize and perform properly date-sensitive functions involving certain dates
prior to and any date after December 31, 1999, and any reprogramming errors

substance satisfactory to the Agent, (D) the Borrower shall have paid in full
the costs and expenses referred to in Section 7, and (E) the Borrower shall have

the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to

deemed to include this Consent and the Supplemental Loan Documents.

(f) The Credit Agreement, the Notes and each of the other Loan
Documents, as specifically amended and modified by this Consent, are and shall
continue to be in full force and effect and are hereby in all respects ratified
and confirmed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral
Documents and all of the Collateral described therein do and shall continue to
secure the payment of all Obligations of the Loan Parties (including IP
Holdings) under the Loan Documents. Parent and Each Loan Party hereby agrees
that (i) Parent and such Loan Party is truly and justly indebted to the Secured
Parties, without defense, counterclaim or offset of any kind in the full amount
of the Secured Obligations and (ii) the Secured Obligations are secured by
valid, perfected, enforceable and unavoidable first priority Liens and security
interests upon the Collateral senior to all other security interests and Liens
upon the Collateral (except as expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement),
granted by Parent and the Loan Parties to the Agent for the ratable benefit of
the Secured Parties.

Payment Date, in arrears, a non-use fee in an amount equal to the product of
(i)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the related Interest
Period and the denominator of which is 360, (ii) 0.375% and (iii) the average,
for each day in such period, of the difference between (A) amount of the
Facility Commitment Amount on such day and (B) the Lender’s Outstanding Loans on
such day (the “Non-Use
Fee”);



(c)   On
any
date on which a prepayment of all Outstanding Loans is made pursuant to
Section 5.05, a prepayment fee in an amount equal to the product of
(i) the
Facility Commitment Amount on such date, and (ii) (A) on or before
June 28, 2006, 2.00%, or (B) at any time after June 28, 2006,
and on
or before June 28, 2008, 1.00%, or (C) at any time after June 15, 2008,
0.00%; and



(d)   On
the
date hereof and thereafter promptly upon receipt of an invoice therefor, all
legal and due diligence expenses of the Lender incurred in connection with
this
Facility.



Section 5.02.   Interest
on the Loans.



(a) Except
as
otherwise provided herein, each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof and on any due but unpaid interest, for each day from
the date of the making of such Loan until the principal amount thereof and
all
interest thereon shall be paid in full. Interest on each Loan shall accrue
during each related Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the applicable
Interest Rate for such Interest Period. The applicable Interest Rate for each
Loan not repaid as of any Payment Date will be determined by the Lender and
reset as of the first day of each successive Interest Period as determined
in
accordance with Section 5.02(e), and subject to Section 5.07.



(b) Except
as
otherwise provided herein, all accrued and unpaid interest on each Loan as
of
the end of each Interest Period shall be payable in arrears on the related
Payment Date during the term of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 5.04(a). All accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.





























(c) If,
by
the terms of this Agreement or the Note, the Borrowers at any time is required
or obligated to pay interest at a rate in excess of the maximum rate permitted
by applicable law, the Interest Rate shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to such maximum rate and the portion of all prior interest payments in excess
of
such maximum rate shall be applied and shall be deemed to have been payments
made in reduction of the principal amount due hereunder and under the
Note.



(d) All
amounts of interest due hereunder shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days, and in each case shall
be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).



(e) The
Adjusted LIBO Rate will be determined by the Lender and communicated to the
Borrowers on each LIBOR Determination Date, and each such determination shall
be
conclusive absent manifest error.



Section 5.03.   Collections
and Cash Flows.




(a) UHI
shall
have established and shall maintain the Collection Account and the Concentration
Account. The Borrowers shall not change any Concentration Account or Collection
Account, or open any new Concentration Account or Collection Account, into
which
any revenues related to the Collateral may be deposited without the prior
written consent of the Lender; provided,
that
any such consent, with respect to any new or changed Concentration Account,
shall not be unreasonably withheld by the Lender.



(b) The
Servicer/Manager shall deposit or cause to be deposited all gross collections,
receipts and proceeds on all Collateral into the Concentration Account. Not
later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time on each Fleet Owner Cash Flow
Determination Date, the Servicer/Manager shall deposit or cause to be deposited
into the Collection Account in immediately available funds, an amount equal
to
Fleet Owner Cash Flows for the immediately preceding month, plus any other
amounts that otherwise are or shall be part of the Collateral (to the extent
not
already deposited in full pursuant to Section 5.03(d), below). So long as no
Default, Event of Default or Collection Sub-Account Failure shall have then
occurred and be continuing, the funds deposited in the Collection Account
pursuant to this Section 5.03(b) shall be transferred on the same Business
Day
to the “Collection Account”, as defined in the Hybrid Facility Agreement.
Neither the Servicer/Manager nor any Borrower shall instruct the Concentration
Account Bank in a manner inconsistent with this Section 5.03(b) without the
prior written consent of the Lender.



(c) UHI
shall
deposit into the Collection Sub-Account, (i) not later than each Deposit
Date, the Collection Sub-Account Deposit for such month and (ii) not
later
than each Loan Date, the Collection Sub-Account Deposit for such Loan Date
(or,
in each case, an amount sufficient so that after such deposit, together with
unrestricted funds already on deposit in the Collection Sub-Account, the total
amount of unrestricted funds on deposit in the Collection Sub-Account would
not
be less than the Collection Sub-Account Deposit). The Lender shall be entitled,
and is hereby authorized and directed by the Servicer/Manager and the Borrowers,
to withdraw any amounts on deposit in the Collection Sub-Account on the next
subsequent Payment Date and apply such amounts to the payment of principal,
interest and other Obligations due on such Payment Date. So long as no Default,
Event of Default, Collection Sub-Account Failure or Borrowing Base Deficiency
shall have then occurred and be continuing, any excess funds in the Collection
Sub-Account after such Payment Date shall be transferred on the same Business
Day to the “Collection Account”, as defined in the Hybrid Facility Agreement.






























(d) Upon
an
Event of Default or a Collection Sub-Account Failure, not later than 3:00 p.m.,
New York City time on each Business Day, the Servicer/Manager shall deposit
or
cause to be deposited into the Collection Account from funds on deposit in
the
Concentration Account, an amount equal to the Daily Collection Account Deposit
Amount. In addition, upon an Event of Default or a Collection Sub-Account
Failure, the Lender may exercise its rights under the Collection Account Control
Agreement and Collection Sub-Account Control Agreement, and thereafter, on
any
Payment Date (or at such times as the Lender may choose in its sole discretion)
any amounts in the Collection Account and Collection Sub-Account shall be
applied from the Collection Account in the following order:





(i)


first,
to the payment of all interest, fees and expenses due and payable
under
this Agreement;










(ii)


second,
to the payment of Targeted Principal payable under this
Agreement;










(iii)


third,
to the payment in full of all other Obligations then due and payable
under
this Agreement;










(iv)


fourth,
to the Collection Sub-Account to be held until the next Payment Date
and
applied in accordance with this Section 5.03;
and










(v)


fifth,
to the “Collection Account”, as defined in the Hybrid Facility
Agreement.








Notwithstanding
any provision herein to the contrary, so long as a Default, Event of Default
or
Collection Sub-Account Failure shall have occurred and be continuing, no funds
deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 5.03(b) or this Section
5.03(d) shall be transferred to the “Collection Account”, as defined in the
Hybrid Facility Agreement.




Section 5.04.   Payments
to be Made.




(a) The
Borrowers shall make each payment (including principal of or interest on any
Loan or any Non-Use Fees or other amounts) or deposit hereunder and under any
other Loan Document not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on each
Deposit Date or Payment Date, as applicable, in immediately available funds,
without setoff, defense or counterclaim (i) in the case of interest, Non-Use
Fees or Targeted Principal, on the Deposit Date immediately preceding the
Payment Date that relates to the Interest Period for which such amount is owing,
and (ii) in each other case on the date on which such amount is due. Each such
payment shall be made to the Lender at such place as may be designated from
time
to time by the Lender in writing to the Borrowers. If any deposit or payment
hereunder or under the Loans becomes due and payable on a day other than a
Business Day, such amount shall be due and payable on the next succeeding
Business Day. If the date for any deposit, payment or prepayment hereunder
is
extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest with respect thereto shall
be payable at the then-applicable Interest Rate during such
extension.





























(b) Except
as
otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment (including principal
of or interest on any Loan or any Non-Use Fees or other amounts) hereunder
or
under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on
a
day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in
the
computation of interest or Non-Use Fees, if applicable.



(c) If
on any
Deposit Date, all or any portion of the amounts required to be deposited in
the
Sub-Account pursuant to Section 5.03(b) are not deposited by or on behalf of
the
Borrowers by the time specified in the first sentence of Section 5.04(a), then
the Lender shall immediately have the right to take control of the Collection
Account in accordance with the Collection Account Control Agreement. Such remedy
shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedies provided for
under this Agreement.



Section 5.05.   Optional
Prepayments.
The
Borrowers may prepay the Loans on any Business Day, in whole or in part, subject
to the requirements of this Section without penalty or premium (except as
provided in Section 5.01(c)), on five days’ prior written notice to the Lender,
provided that (i) the principal amount prepaid is at least $1,000,000
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Lender) and (ii) the
Borrowers pay to the Lender, on the date of prepayment, accrued unpaid interest
on the amount so prepaid. The Borrowers may notify the Lender in writing that
it
has elected to terminate the Facility in connection with the prepayment in
full
of the Loans and all other outstanding Obligations. Upon such prepayment in
full, together with payment in full the fee described in Section 5.01(c), and
the termination of the Facility, the Lender’s interest in the Collateral shall
be released in accordance with Section 3.02 and the Commitment of the
Lender hereunder shall terminate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any payment in full of the Loans and other Obligations hereunder or
termination of the Facility shall not act to release the interest of the lender
in the Hybrid Facility in the Collateral (to the extent and in the amounts
required in the Hybrid Facility Agreement) if the Hybrid Facility shall remain
outstanding or any amounts remain owing thereunder.



Section 5.06.   [Reserved].




Section 5.07.   Illegality;
Substituted Interest Rate, etc.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if (i) any Requirement of
Law
or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof shall
make
it unlawful for the Lender to make or maintain any Loans at the Interest Rate
or
(ii) the Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that, by reason of circumstances
affecting the LIBOR interbank market, adequate and reasonable means do not
exist
for ascertaining the Interest Rate, then (a) the obligation of the Lender
to make or maintain Loans at the Interest Rate shall be suspended and the Lender
shall promptly notify the Borrowers thereof (by telephone confirmed in writing)
and (b) each Loan then outstanding, if any, shall, from and including
the
commencement of the next Interest Period or at such earlier date as may be
required by law, until payment in full thereof, bear interest at the rate per
annum equal to the greater of the Prime Rate or the Interest Rate in effect
on
the date immediately preceding the date any event described in clause (i)
or (ii) occurred. If subsequent to such suspension of the obligation of the
Lenders to make or maintain the Loans at the Interest Rate, the circumstances
described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence, as applicable,
no longer exist, the Lender shall so notify the Borrowers, and the obligation
of
the Lender to do so shall be reinstated effective as of the date the
circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, no longer
exist.





























Section 5.08.   Payments
of Principal; Mandatory Prepayments.



(a) On
each
Payment Date, the Borrowers shall pay to the Lender, an amount equal to the
Targeted Principal, if any, for such Payment Date.



(b) If
any
Monthly Settlement Report reports that a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists as
of
such date, then the Borrowers shall no later than the next Business Day
following delivery of such Monthly Settlement Report either (i) pay to the
Lender an amount equal to the difference of (x) the Outstanding Loans
minus
(y) the
product of (A) the aggregate Market Value of the Eligible Vehicle Collateral
and
(B) the Advance Rate on such date or (ii) pledge additional Eligible Vehicle
Collateral under the Security Agreement having an aggregate Market Value that
shall cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency. If an item of Collateral included
in
the Borrowing Base and for which a Loan was advanced fails at any time to be
acceptable to the Lender under the definition of Eligible Vehicle Collateral,
as
determined by the Lender in its sole discretion, the Market Value of such
Collateral as of such date of determination will be deemed to be
zero.



(c) Upon
discovery by any of the Borrowers, the Servicer/Manager or the Lender of a
breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 6.14, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written
notice to the Borrowers and to the other parties. If such breach would, in
and
of itself, result in a Borrowing Base Deficiency, which Borrowing Base
Deficiency is not cured by the next Business Day after the Borrowers discovers
or receives notice of such breach, the Borrowers shall, unless such breach
shall
have been cured in all material respects, remit to the Lender an amount equal
to
the amount of such Borrowing Base Deficiency, in the manner set forth in
Section 5.08. The foregoing obligation shall apply to all representations
and warranties of the Borrowers contained in Section 6.14 whether or
not
Borrower has knowledge of the breach at the time of the breach or at the time
the representations and warranties were made. The Lender shall not have any
duty
to conduct an affirmative investigation as to the occurrence of any breach
of
any representations and warranties of the Borrowers set forth in
Section 6.14 that would require the Borrowers to remit any mandatory
repayment pursuant to this Section.





























Section 5.09.   Increased
Costs.



(a)   If
any
Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, the Lender (except any such reserve
requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or (ii) impose on the Lender
or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement
or
Loans made by the Lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to
increase the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of
any
sum received or receivable by the Lender hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise), then the Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, pay
to
the Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender
for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.



(b)   If
the
Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has
or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Lender’s capital or
on the capital of the Lender’s holding company, as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Loans made by the Lender to a level below that which the Lender
or the Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration the Lender’s policies and the policies of the
Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to
time the Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, pay to the Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender or the Lender’s
holding company for any such reduction suffered.



(c)   A
certificate of the Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate the Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and the basis therefor shall
be
delivered to the Borrowers by the Lender and shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. The Borrowers shall pay the Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.



(d)   Failure
or delay on the part of the Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of the Lender’s right to demand such
compensation; provided
that the
Borrowers shall not be required to compensate the Lender pursuant to this
Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior
to the date that the Lender notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of the Lender’s intention to
claim compensation therefor; provided
further
that, if
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.





























Section 5.10.   Taxes.



(a)   Any
and
all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder
or
under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Taxes; provided
that if
the Borrowers shall be required to deduct any Taxes from such payments, then
(i)
the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section) the Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall make such
deductions and (iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.



(b)   The
Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the Lender, within
10
days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Taxes paid by
the
Lender on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation
of
the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Taxes
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section)
and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed
or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment delivered to the Borrowers by the Lender, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.



(c)   As
soon
as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental
Authority, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Lender the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment,
a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.



(d)   If
the
Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of
any
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers pursuant to this
Section 5.10, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrowers (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made by the Borrowers under this Section 5.10
with
respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund); provided,
however,
that
the Borrowers, upon the request of the Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid
over to the Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed
by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender in the event the Lender
is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained
in this Section 5.10 shall require the Lender to make available its tax returns
(or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential)
to
the Borrowers or any other Person.



(e)   Without
prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrowers hereunder,
the
agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 5.10
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.


































ARTICLE
VI



REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES



Each
of
the Loan Parties represents and warrants to the Lender that:



Section 6.01.   Organization;
Powers.
Each of
the Loan Parties is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has all requisite corporate
power
and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business
in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.



Section 6.02.   Authorization;
Enforceability.
The
Transactions to be entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party’s
corporate or individual, as the case may be, powers. The Transactions to be
entered into by each Loan Party have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate and, if required, stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each Loan Party and constitutes, and each other Loan
Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered
by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation
of
such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.



Section 6.03.   Governmental
Approvals; No Conflicts.
The
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or
filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such
as
have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and except filings
necessary to perfect Liens created under the Security Documents, (b) will not
violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents of any Loan Party or any order of any Governmental
Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture,
agreement or other instrument evidencing or governing any material indebtedness
or any other material indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon
any
Loan Party or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any
payment to be made by any Loan Party, and (d) will not result in the creation
or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of any Loan Party, except Liens created
under the Security Documents.



Section 6.04.   Financial
Condition; No Material Adverse Change.



(a)   UHI
has
heretofore furnished to the Lender the consolidated balance sheet and statements
of income, equity and cash flows of AMERCO as of and for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2004, and the consolidated balance sheet and statements of income,
stockholders equity and cash flows of AMERCO as of and for the fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2004, each certified by a Financial Officer of UHI or AMERCO.
Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of AMERCO as of
such
dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to year end audit
adjustments. As of the date hereof, no Loan Party has any liabilities in excess
of $25,000,000 except as disclosed on Schedule 6.04.





























(b)   Since
March 31, 2005, there has been no material adverse change in the business,
condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance or properties of
AMERCO, UHI or the Borrowers.



Section 6.05.   Properties;
Liens and Licenses.



(a)   Each
of
the Loan Parties has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, or licenses
of or easements for all the real and personal property material to its business,
except for minor defects in title that do not interfere with its ability to
conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for
their intended purposes, and none of such property is subject to any Lien other
than Permitted Encumbrances.



(b)   Each
of
the Loan Parties owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, trade names,
copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business,
and the use thereof by the Loan Parties does not infringe upon the rights of
any
other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.



(c)   Each
of
the Loan Parties has all licenses and permits that are material to the business
of such Loan Party. Each license or permit that is material to the business
of
the Loan Parties, is valid and in full force and effect, and each of the Loan
Parties is in compliance in all material respects with the terms and conditions
thereof.



Section 6.06.   Litigation
Matters.
There
are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of any Loan Party, threatened
against or affecting the Loan Parties (i) as to which there is a reasonable
possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined,
could
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or the
Transactions.



Section 6.07.   Compliance
with Laws and Agreements.
Each of
the Loan Parties is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of
any
Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,
agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where
the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably
be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and
is
continuing.



Section 6.08.   Investment
and Holding Company Status.
None of
the Loan Parties is (a) an “investment company” as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a “holding company”
as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935.





























Section 6.09.   Taxes.
Each of
the Loan Parties has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and
reports required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes
required to have been paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested
in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the applicable Loan Party
has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) the filing of local Tax
returns and reports to the extent that the failure to do so, individually or
in
the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.



Section 6.10.   ERISA.
Each
Plan has been administered in compliance with all applicable laws except for
such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No ERISA Event has occurred
or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other
such
ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present
value
of all accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions
used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did
not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements of AMERCO reflecting
such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and
the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
(based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
statements of AMERCO reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value
of
the assets of all such underfunded Plans.



Section 6.11.   Disclosure.
Each of
the Loan Parties has disclosed to the Lender all agreements, instruments and
corporate or other restrictions to which any of the Loan Parties is subject
that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. None of the reports, financial statements,
certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party
to
the Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder, including any Monthly
Settlement Report, contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, taken as a whole,
in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided
that,
with respect to projected financial information, each of the Loan Parties
represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.



Section 6.12.   The
Collateral.
The
Collateral is owned by the Person granting each security interest in such
Collateral under any Security Document, free and clear of any Lien or other
adverse claim except as contemplated under the Loan Documents. Each of the
representations and warranties of the Loan Parties contained herein are true
and
correct. No agreements have been executed and delivered pursuant to which a
Person pledges or grants, or purports to pledge or grant, any Lien, other than
Permitted Encumbrances, on the Collateral to any Person other than the
Lender.



With
respect to the Borrowers, the Security Agreement is effective to create in
favor
of the Lender, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the
Collateral and, upon the filing of the necessary financing statements in the
offices specified in the Security Agreement, or the filing of liens on Vehicles
in the offices specified in the Security Agreement, as applicable, the interest
of the Lender in the Collateral will be perfected under Article 9 of the UCC
or
the applicable state motor vehicle law, as applicable, prior to and enforceable
against all creditors of and purchasers from the Borrowers and all other Persons
whatsoever (other than the Lender and its successors and assigns). On or prior
to the date each Loan is made hereunder and each recomputation of the Borrowing
Base, all financing statements and other documents required to be recorded
or
filed in order to perfect and protect the Lender’s interests in the Collateral
against all creditors of and purchasers from the Borrowers and all other Persons
whatsoever will have been duly filed in each filing office necessary for such
purpose and all filing fees and taxes, if any, payable in connection with such
filings shall have been paid in full.






























Section 6.13.   Liens
on the Collateral.
Effective immediately upon the Closing Date, (a) no effective financing
statement or other similar instrument covering any Collateral is on file in
any
recording office, and (b) no Lien covering any Vehicle constituting Collateral
is noted on the Certificate of Title of such Vehicle or on file in any title
recording office, in each case other than (i) in favor of the Lender
or
(ii) for a period of 120 days following the Closing Date in favor of
the
secured parties under the Foothill Facility.



Section 6.14.   Eligible
Vehicle Collateral.
As of
the date of each Borrowing Request, all Vehicles set forth in the Vehicle
Schedule to be delivered with each Borrowing Request are Eligible Vehicle
Collateral.



Section 6.15.   Insurance.
Schedule 6.15 sets forth a description of all insurance maintained by

under any applicable law, or which the Lender may reasonably request, to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or to grant,
preserve, protect or perfect the Liens created or intended to be created by
the
Security Documents or the validity or priority of any such Lien, all at the

Proceeds retained by or paid over to the Lender shall be held by the Lender
and
released from time to time to pay the costs of repairing, restoring or replacing
the affected property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Security Documents, subject to the provisions
of
the Security Documents regarding application of such Net Proceeds during a
Default or an Event of Default.

any
Net Proceeds retained by the Lender or deposited in the Collection Sub-Account
as provided above continue to be held by the Lender on the date that any
prepayment is due pursuant to Section 5.08 in respect of the event
resulting in such Net Proceeds, then such Net Proceeds shall be applied to
prepay Loans as provided in Section 5.08.



Section 8.13.   Interest
Rate Protection.

Section 12.02.   Waivers;
Amendments.



(a)   No
failure or delay by the Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or
under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other
or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent
to
any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the
purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the
making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless
of whether the Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the
time.





























(b)   Neither
this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof
may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement,
pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers
and the Lender or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Loan Party or Loan
Parties that are parties thereto with the consent of the Lender; provided
that no
such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of the Lender without the
written consent of the Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or
reduce the rate of interest on such Loan, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of the Lender, (iii) postpone the scheduled date
of
payment of the principal amount of any Loan or any interest thereon, or any
fees
payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment,
or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written
consent of the Lender, (iv) change any of the provisions of this Section without
the written consent of the Lender, (v) release all or any substantial part
of
the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents (except as expressly
provided herein or therein), without the written consent of the Lender, or
(vi)
release of UHI from its guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement (except as
expressly provided in the Guarantee Agreement) or limit or condition its
obligations thereunder, without the written consent of the Lender.



Section 12.03.   Expenses;
Indemnity; Damage Waiver.



(a)   The
Borrowers shall pay (i) all costs and expenses incurred by the Lender, including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Lender, in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of the
Loan
Documents (including expenses incurred in connection with its due diligence
activities) and (ii) all costs and expenses incurred by the Lender, including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Lender,
in
connection with (A) the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection
with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in
connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such costs and expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Loans, and (B) in the case of the Lender, the administration of, and any
amendments, modifications, waivers or supplements of or to the provisions of,
any of the Loan Documents.



(b)   The
Borrowers shall indemnify the Lender, and each Related Party of any of the
foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”)
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
to
the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or the
consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, or (iii) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any
of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided
that
such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses have resulted
from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.





























(c)   To
the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers shall not assert, and each
of
them hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.



(d)   All
amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 30 days after
written demand therefor.



Section 12.04.   Successors
and Assigns.



(a)   The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
except that a Loan Party may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lender (and
any attempted assignment or transfer by any Loan Party without such consent
shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall
be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Lender) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.



(b)   The
Lender may, without the consent of the Loan Parties, assign all or a portion
of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of
its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided
that (i)
except in the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of MLCFC or its successors
or assigns, or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the Lender’s
Commitment or entire remaining Loans, the amount of the Commitment and Loans
of
the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the
date
the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
by
the assigning Lender) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless the Borrowers
otherwise consent, (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement, except that this clause (ii) shall not be construed to
prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all of the assigning Lender’s
rights and obligations in respect of (A) Loans, (B) Loans separately from (or
without assigning) Commitments or (C) Commitments separately from (or without
assigning) Loans, (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
an Assignment and Acceptance, and (iv) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender
hereunder prior to such assignment, shall deliver to the Borrowers its notice
and payment information. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant
to
paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in
each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of
the
assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Lender shall
cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits
of
Sections 5.09, 5.10 and 12.03). Any assignment or transfer by the Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by the
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (c) of this Section.





























(c)   The
Lender may, without the consent of the Loan Parties, sell participations to
one
or more Persons (a “Participant”)
in all
or a portion of the Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (i)
the Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Loan Parties shall continue to
deal solely and directly with the Lender in connection with the Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant
to
which the Lender sells such a participation shall provide that the Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents;
provided
that
such agreement or instrument may provide that the Lender will not, without
the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 12.02(b) that affects such
Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Loan Parties agree
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 5.09 and
5.10 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest
by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section provided that such
Participant agrees to be subject to Sections 5.10(f) as though it was a Lender.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to
the
benefits of Section 12.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 5.15(c) as though it were a Lender.



(d)   The
Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of the Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of
a
security interest; provided
that no
such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release the Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee
for
the Lender as a party hereto.



Section 12.05.   Survival.
All
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties
in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered
in
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of
any
Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its
behalf and notwithstanding that the Lender may have had notice or knowledge
of
any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit
is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as
the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the
Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 5.09,
5.10 and 12.03 and Article XI shall survive and remain in full force and effect
regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or
the
termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.





























Section 12.06.   Counterparts;
Integration; Effectiveness.
This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto
on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all
of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to
fees
payable to the Lender constitute the entire contract among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements
and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in Section 7.01(a), this Agreement shall become effective when
it
shall have been executed by the Lender and when the Lender shall have received
counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each
of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to
the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
of
this Agreement.



Section 12.07.   Severability.
Any
provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not
invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.



Section 12.08.   Right
of Setoff.
If an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lender and each
of
its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held
and
other obligations at any time owing by the Lender or Affiliate to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrowers against any of and all the obligations
of
the Borrowers now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by the Lender,
irrespective of whether or not the Lender shall have made any demand under
this
Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of the
Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which the Lender may have.



Section 12.09.   Governing
Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.





























(a)   THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF

any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or
for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of
any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State
or,
to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall
be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other
Loan
Document shall affect any right that the Lender may otherwise have to bring
any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
against the Borrowers or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.



(c)   UHI
and
the Borrowers hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now
or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of
an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.



(d)   Each
of
the Servicer/Manager, the Guarantor and each Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees
that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by
mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially
similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Person at its address set forth
in Section 12.01 or at such other address of which the Lender shall have been
notified pursuant thereto. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.



Section 12.10.   WAIVER
OF JURY TRIAL.
EACH
PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
ANY
OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.



Section 12.11.   Headings.
Article
and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience
of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the
construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this
Agreement.





























Section 12.12.   Confidentiality.
The
Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below) and not use the Information for any purpose not contemplated by this
Agreement, except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its
Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by

those of this Section, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, (g) with the consent of UHI or the Borrowers or (h) to the extent
such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a
breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than UHI or the Borrowers. For the
purposes of this Section, “Information”
means
all information received from UHI or the Borrowers relating to UHI or the
Borrowers or its business, other than any such information that is publicly
available or available to the Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by UHI or the Borrowers, provided that such information is identified
at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised
the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as
such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.



Section 12.13.   Joint
and Several Liability of Borrowers.
Each
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, whether or not specifically indicated
as
such in a Loan Document, all Obligations shall be joint and several Obligations
of each individual Borrower, and in furtherance of such joint and several
Obligations, each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees
the
payment of all Obligations of each other Borrower. Each Borrower hereby
acknowledges and agrees that such Borrower shall be jointly and severally liable
to the Lender for all representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and
indemnities of the Borrowers hereunder.

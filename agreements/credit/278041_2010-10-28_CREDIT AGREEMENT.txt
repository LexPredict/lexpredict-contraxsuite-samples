contrary, each Lender may, without consulting with or obtaining consent from either Security Party, at any time charge, assign or otherwise create security in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under this Agreement, the Note or any Security Document to secure obligations of that Lender including, without limitation, any charge, assignment or other security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank, except that no such charge, assignment or security shall release a Lender from any of its obligations under this Agreement, the Note or any Security Document or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or other security for the Lender as a party to this Agreement, the Note or any Security Document or require any payments to be made by a Security Party or grant to any person any more extensive rights than those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under this Agreement, the Note or any Security Document.





13. ILLEGALITY, INCREASED COST, NON-AVAILABILITY, ETC.





13.1 Illegality.  In the event that by reason of any change in any applicable law, regulation or regulatory requirement or in the interpretation thereof, a Lender has a reasonable basis to conclude that it has become unlawful for any Lender to maintain or give effect to its obligations as contemplated by this Agreement, such Lender shall inform the Facility Agent and the Borrower to that effect, whereafter the liability of such Lender to make its Commitment available shall forthwith cease and the Borrower shall be required either to repay to such Lender that portion of the Facility advanced by such Lender immediately or, if such Lender so agrees, to repay such
portion of the Facility to the Lender on the last day of the calendar month in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 13.5.  In any such event, but without prejudice to the aforesaid obligations of the Borrower to repay such portion of the Facility, the Borrower and the relevant Lender shall negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing on terms for making such portion of the Facility available from another jurisdiction or otherwise restructuring such portion of the Facility on a basis which is not unlawful.





13.2 Increased Costs.  If any change in applicable law, regulation or regulatory requirement, or in the interpretation or application thereof by any governmental or other authority, shall:







(i)


subject any Lender to any Taxes with respect to its income from the Facility, or any part thereof, or












(ii)


change the basis of taxation to any Lender of payments of principal or interest or any other payment due or to become due pursuant to this Agreement (other than a change in the basis effected by the jurisdiction of organization of such Lender, the jurisdiction of the principal place of business of such Lender, the United States of America, the State or City of New York or any governmental subdivision or other taxing authority having jurisdiction over such Lender (unless such jurisdiction is asserted by reason of the activities of any Security Party) or such other jurisdiction where the Facility may be payable), or












(iii)


impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve requirements or require the making of any special deposits against or in respect of any assets or liabilities of, deposits with or for the account of, or loans by, a Lender, or












(iv)


impose on any Lender any other condition affecting the Facility or any part thereof,










and the result of the foregoing is either to increase the cost to such Lender of making available or maintaining its Commitment or any part thereof or to reduce the amount of any payment received by such Lender, then and in any such case if such increase or reduction in the opinion of such Lender materially affects the interests of such Lender under or in connection with this Agreement:





(a) such Lender shall notify the Facility Agent and the Borrower of the happening of such event, and





(b) the Borrower agrees forthwith upon demand to pay to such Lender such amount as such Lender certifies to be necessary to compensate such Lender for such additional cost or such reduction; provided however, that the foregoing provisions shall not be applicable in the event that increased costs to the Lender result from the exercise by the Lender of its right to assign its rights or obligations under Section 12.





13.3 Nonavailability of Funds.  If the Facility Agent shall determine that, by reason of circumstances affecting the London Interbank Market generally, adequate and reasonable means do not or will not exist for ascertaining the Applicable Rate, the Facility Agent shall give notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders.  The Borrower, the Facility Agent and the Majority Lenders shall then negotiate in good faith in order to agree upon a mutually satisfactory interest rate to be substituted for that which would otherwise have applied under this Agreement.  If the Borrower, the Facility Agent and the Majority Lenders are unable
to agree upon such a substituted interest rate within thirty (30) days of the giving of such determination notice, the Facility Agent shall set an interest rate to take effect at the Facility Agent's direction, which rate shall be equal to the Margin plus the cost to the Lenders (as certified by each Lender) of funding the Facility.





13.4 Lender's Certificate Conclusive.  A certificate or determination notice of the Facility Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, as to any of the matters referred to in this Section 13 shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower.





13.5 Compensation for Losses.  Where any portion of the Facility is to be repaid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 13, the Borrower agrees simultaneously with such repayment to pay to the relevant Lender all accrued interest to the date of actual payment on the amount repaid and all other sums then payable by the Borrower to the relevant Lender pursuant to this Agreement, together with such amounts as may be certified by the relevant Lender to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any actual loss, premium or penalties incurred or to be incurred thereby on account of funds borrowed to make, fund or maintain its Commitment or such portion thereof
for the remainder (if any) of the then current calendar month, but otherwise without penalty or premium.





14. CURRENCY INDEMNITY





14.1 Currency Conversion.  If for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing a judgment in any court in any country it becomes necessary to convert into any other currency (the “judgment currency”) an amount due in Dollars under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents then the conversion shall be made, in the discretion of the Facility Agent, at the rate of exchange prevailing either on the date of default or on the day before the day on which the judgment is given or the order for enforcement is made, as the case may be (the “conversion date”), provided that the Facility Agent shall not be entitled to recover under this section any amount in the judgment currency which exceeds at the conversion date the amount in Dollars due under this Agreement, the Note and/or the other Transaction Documents.





14.2 Change in Exchange Rate.  If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the conversion date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, the Borrower shall pay such additional amounts (if any, but in any event not a lesser amount) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the judgment currency when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment will produce the amount then due under this Agreement, the Note and/or the other Transaction Documents in Dollars; any excess over the amount due received or collected by the Lenders shall be remitted to the Borrower.





14.3 Additional Debt Due.  Any amount due from the Borrower under this Section 14 shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sums due under or in respect of this Agreement, the Note and/or any of the Security Documents.

day from the date such amount is made available to the Lenders until the date such amount is repaid to the Facility Agent or the Security Trustee, as the case may be, as calculated by the Facility Agent or Security Trustee to reflect its cost of funds.





17.4 Holder of Interest in Note.  The Agents may treat each Lender as the holder of all of the interest of such Lender in the Note.





17.5 No Duty to Examine, Etc.  The Agents shall not be under a duty to examine or pass upon the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of any of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any instrument, document or communication furnished pursuant to this Agreement or in connection therewith or in connection with any other Transaction Document, and the Agents shall be entitled to assume that the same are valid, effective and genuine, have been signed or sent by the proper parties and are what they purport to be.





17.6 Agents as Lenders.  With respect to that portion of the Facility made available by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall include the Agent in its capacity as a Lender.  Each Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Borrower and the Guarantor as if it were not an Agent.





17.7 Acts of the Agents.  Each Agent shall have duties and discretion, and shall act as follows:





(a) Obligations of the Agents.  The obligations of each Agent under this Agreement, the Note and the other Transaction Documents are only those expressly set forth herein and therein;





(b) No Duty to Investigate.  No Agent shall  at any time, unless requested to do so by a Lender or Lenders, be under any duty to enquire whether an Event of Default, or an event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, has occurred or to investigate the performance of this Agreement, the Note or any Security Document by any Security Party;





(c) Discretion of the Agents.  Each Agent shall be entitled to use its discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any rights which may be vested in it by, and with respect to taking or refraining from taking any action or actions which it may be able to take under or in respect of, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, unless the Facility Agent shall have been instructed by the Majority Lenders to exercise such rights or to take or refrain from taking such action; provided, however, that no Age
nt shall be required to take any action which exposes it to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law; and





(d) Instructions of Majority Lenders.  Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or under any other Transaction Document in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Lenders, and any action taken or failure to act pursuant to such instructions shall be binding on all of the Lenders.





17.8 Certain Amendments.  Neither this Agreement, the Note nor any of the Security Documents nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended unless such amendment is approved by the Borrower and the Majority Lenders, provided that no such amendment shall, without the consent of each Lender affected thereby, (i) reduce the interest rate or extend the time of payment of scheduled principal payments or interest or fees on the Facility, or reduce the principal amount of the Facility or any fees hereunder, (ii) increase or decrea
se the Commitment of any Lender or subject any Lender to any additional obligation (it being understood that a waiver of any Event of Default or any mandatory repayment of the Facility shall not constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment of any Lender), (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 17.8, (iv) amend the definition of Majority Lenders or any other definition referred to in this Section 17.8, (v) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, (vi) release any Security Party from any of its obligations under any Security Document except as expressly provided herein or in such Security Document or (vii) amend any provision relating to the maintenance of collateral under Section 9.4.  All amendments approved by the Majority Lenders under this Section 17.8 must be in writing and signed by the Borrower and each of the Lenders.  In the event that any Lender is
unable to or refuses to sign an amendment approved by the Majority Lenders hereunder, such Lender hereby appoints the Agent as its Attorney-In-Fact for the purposes of signing such amendment.  No provision of this Section 17 or any other provisions relating to the Agent may be modified without the consent of the Agent.





17.9 Assumption re Event of Default.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 17.15, the Facility Agent and the Security Trustee shall be entitled to assume that no Event of Default, or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, has occurred and is continuing, unless it has been notified by any Security Party of such fact, or has been notified by a Lender that such Lender considers that an Event of Default or such an event (specifying in detail the nature thereof) has occurred and is continuing.  In the event that either thereof shall have been notified by any Security Party or any Lende
r in the manner set forth in the preceding sentence of any Event of Default or of an event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, the Facility Agent shall notify the Lenders and shall take action and assert such rights under this Agreement, under the Note and under Security Documents as the Majority Lenders shall request in writing.





17.10 Limitations of Liability.  No Agent or Lender shall be under any liability or responsibility whatsoever:





(a) to any Security Party or any other person or entity as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance by, or any breach by, any other Lenders or any other person of any of its or their obligations under this Agreement or under any Security Document;





(b) to any Lender or Lenders as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance by, or any breach by, any Security Party of any of its respective obligations under this Agreement or under the other Transaction Documents; or





(c) to any Lender or Lenders for any statements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, in any Security Document or in any document or instrument delivered in connection with the transaction hereby contemplated; or for the validity, effectiveness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any document or instrument delivered in connection with the transactions hereby contemplated.





17.11 Indemnification of the Agent and Security Trustee.  The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Security Parties or any thereof), pro rata according to the respective amounts of their Commitments, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including legal fees and expenses incurred in investigating claims and defending itself against such liabilities) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against, such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Tr
ansaction Document, any action taken or omitted by such Agent thereunder or the preparation, administration, amendment or enforcement of, or waiver of any provision of, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, except that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the  gross negligence or willful misconduct of either such Agent.





17.12 Consultation with Counsel.  Each of the Facility Agent and the Security Trustee may consult with legal counsel selected by such Agent and shall not be liable for any action taken, permitted or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.





17.13 Resignation.  Any Agent may resign at any time by giving sixty (60) days' written notice thereof to the other Agents, the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within sixty (60) days after the retiring Agent's giving notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank or trust company of recognized standing.  The appointment of any successor Agent shall be sub
ject to the prior written consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.  After any retiring Agent's resignation as Agent hereunder, the provisions of this Section 17 shall continue in effect for its benefit with respect to any actions taken or omitted by it while acting as Agent.





17.14 Representations of Lenders.  Each Lender represents and warrants to each other Lender and the Agent that:





(a) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to make its Commitment available hereunder, it has independently taken whatever steps it considers necessary to evaluate the financial condition and affairs of the Security Parties, that it has made an independent credit judgment and that it has not relied upon any statement, representation or warranty by any other Lender or any Agent; and





(b) so long as any portion of its Commitment remains outstanding, it will continue to make its own independent evaluation of the financial condition and affairs of the Security Parties.





17.15 Notification of Event of Default.  The Facility Agent hereby undertakes to promptly notify the Lenders, and the Lenders hereby promptly undertake to notify the Facility Agent and the other Lenders, of the existence of any Event of Default which shall have occurred and be continuing of which such party has actual knowledge.





17.16 No Agency or Trusteeship if ING only Lender.  If at any time ING is the only Lender, all references to the terms “Facility Agent” and “Security Trustee” shall be deemed to be references to ING as Lender and not as agent or security trustee.





18. NOTICES AND DEMANDS





18.1 Notices.  All notices, requests, demands and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including prepaid overnight courier, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to the Borrower or the Guarantor at the address or facsimile number set forth below and to the Lenders and the Agents at their address and facsimile numbers set forth in Schedule I or at such other address or facsimile numbers as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to each other party hereto.  Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile, when such facsimile is

19. MISCELLANEOUS





19.1 Time of Essence.  Time is of the essence of this Agreement but no failure or delay on the part of any Creditor to exercise any power or right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Creditor of any power or right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right.  The remedies provided herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.





19.2 Unenforceable, etc., Provisions - Effect.  In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agree­ment or in the other Transaction Documents would, if given effect, be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any law applicable in any relevant jurisdiction, said provision shall not be enforceable against the relevant Security Party, but the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions herein or therein contained shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.





19.3 References.  References herein to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules are to be construed as references to articles, sections of, exhibits to, and schedules to, this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents as applicable, unless the context otherwise requires.





19.4 Further Assurances.  Each of the Security Parties hereby agrees that if this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents shall, in the reasonable opinion of the Lenders, at any time be deemed by the Lenders for any reason insufficient in whole or in part to carry out the true intent and spirit hereof or thereof, it will execute or cause to be executed such other and further assurances and documents as in the opinion of the Lenders may be required in order to more effectively accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents.





19.5 Prior Agreements, Merger.  Any and all prior understandings and agreements heretofore entered into between the Security Parties on the one part, and the Creditors, on the other part, relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether written or oral, are superseded by and merged into this Agreement and the other agreements (the forms of which are exhibited hereto) to be executed and delivered in connection herewith to which the Security Parties, the Agent, the Security Trustee and/or the Lenders are parties, which alone fully and completely express the agreements between the Security Parties, the Agents, and the Lenders.





19.6 Entire Agreement; Amendments.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto including all parties added hereto pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement.  Subject to Section 17.8, any provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower, the Agents, and the Majority Lenders.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument.





19.7 Indemnification.  Neither any Creditor nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any of the Security Parties for any action taken or not taken thereby in connection herewith in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Borrower and the Guarantor hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Creditors, their respective affiliates and the respective directors, officers, agents and employees of the foregoing (each an “Indemnitee”) and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses of any kind, including, without limita
tion, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any actual or proposed use of proceeds of the Facility hereunder, or any related transaction or claim; provided that (i) no Indemnitee shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) to the extent permitted by law, the Indemnitee shall provide the Security Parties with prompt notice of any such investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding after the Indemnitee becomes aware of such proceeding; provided, however, that the Indemnitee's failure to provide such notice in a timely manner shall not relieve the Security Parties of their obligations hereunder.





19.8 Headings.  In this Agreement, Section headings are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be taken into account in the interpretation of this Agreement.

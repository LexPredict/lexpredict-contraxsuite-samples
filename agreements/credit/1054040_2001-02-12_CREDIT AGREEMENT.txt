The Amendment Fee payable to a Lender shall be paid to the Administrative Agent

once paid, shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

SECTION 3.  Reduction in Revolving Commitments.  The Borrower hereby
permanently reduces, in accordance with Section 2.08 of the Credit Agreement,
effective as of the Amendment Effective Date (as defined below), the Revolving

the end of each of the first two months of each fiscal quarter, the Borrower
will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender its consolidated
balance sheet and related statements of operations and cash flows showing the
financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
close of such fiscal month and the results of its operations and the operations

SECTION 5.  Representations and Warranties.  Each of the Borrower and
Holdings represents and warrants to each other party hereto that, after giving
effect to this Amendment, (a) the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III of the Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date hereof with the same effect as though made on and
as of the date hereof, except to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date, and (b) no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.

SECTION 6.  Conditions to Effectiveness.  This Amendment shall become
effective as of the date first written above on the date (the "Amendment
Effective Date") that the Administrative Agent shall have received (a)
counterparts of this Amendment which, when taken together, bear the signatures
of the Borrower, Holdings and the Required Lenders and (b) the Amendment Fees
and reimbursement of all other fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent for
which invoices have been submitted to the Borrower.

SECTION 7.  Effect of Amendment.  Except as expressly set forth
herein, this Amendment shall not by implication or otherwise limit, impair,
constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect the rights and remedies of the
Lenders, the Swingline Lender, the Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent or the
Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, and
shall not alter, modify, amend or in any way affect any of the terms,
conditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Credit
Agreement or any other Loan Document, all of which are ratified and affirmed in
all respects and shall continue in full force and effect.  Nothing herein shall
be deemed to entitle the Borrower or Holdings to a consent to, or a waiver,
amendment, modification or other change of, any of the terms, conditions,
obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the Credit Agreement or any
other Loan Document in similar or different circumstances.  This Amendment shall
apply and be effective only with respect to the provisions of the Credit
Agreement specifically referred to herein.

SECTION 8.  Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in any number
of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all
such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
Delivery of any executed counterpart of a signature page of this Amendment by
facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart hereof.

SECTION 9.  Applicable Law.  THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND

John Hancock Agreement, the John Hancock Notes, or any other document
evidencing Indebtedness of a type permitted pursuant to clause (c) of Section
7.2.2 shall prohibit the creation of Liens on any property of the Borrower or
its Subsidiaries in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders and other Secured Parties to secure the obligations of the Borrower or
any other Obligor, unless such prohibition concerns the Borrower's creation of
Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent which are not on at least a pari passu
basis with any Liens on such property in favor of John Hancock as security for
the John Hancock Notes and the John Hancock Note Agreement."

SECTION 19.      Amendment of Section 8.1.5. Section 8.1.5 of the
Credit Agreement is hereby amended by (a) changing the final period thereof to
a comma and (b) adding the following after the final word and immediately after
such comma: "or any event of default (as defined in the John Hancock Note
Agreement) shall occur or any event of default (as defined in each John Hancock
Note) shall occur or any event or condition shall exist which, with the passage
of time or the giving of notice, or both, shall be sufficient to permit the
holder of any John Hancock Note or any trustee or agent for such holder or
holders to cause such Indebtedness to become due and payable prior to its
expressed maturity."

SECTION 20.      Addition of Section 9.8. Article IX of the Credit
Agreement is hereby amended by adding thereto the following Section 9.8:

SECTION 9.8      Collateral Agent. The provisions of Article

Agent with respect to all matters,





14
<PAGE>   15
actions and inactions pursuant to the Mortgages and relating to the
Mortgaged Property. Each reference to the Agent in Article IX and in
Sections 10.3 and 10.4 shall be deemed to include a reference to the
Collateral Agent in its capacity as such and each reference to "CIBC"
in Section 9.5 shall be deemed to include CIBC Inc.  Each Lender
hereby agrees that it shall cause each of its Affiliates which becomes
a Swap Bank pursuant to any Hedging Agreement secured by the Mortgage
to execute such agreements and documents as the Agent or Collateral
Agent may reasonably request to evidence such Affiliate's agreement to
the provisions of this Article IX and the Mortgages.

SECTION 21.      Amendment of Section 10.l(d). Clause (d) of Section
10.1 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to

thereto and all amendments, supplements and modifications to any thereof and
any and all other documents or instruments of further assurance required to be
filed or recorded or refiled or rerecorded by the terms hereof or of any
Mortgage or of the Security Agreement."

SECTION 23.      Amendment of Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure
Schedule attached to the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting
therefrom Item 6.8 ("Existing Subsidiaries") and inserting in lieu thereof Item
6.8 as attached hereto.

SECTION 24.      Other Additional Amendments. CD Rate Loans shall no
longer be available under the Credit Agreement, accordingly all references and
provisions relating to CD Rate Loans contained in the Credit Agreement shall
have no force and effect and shall not apply with respect to any period
commencing after the date hereof insofar as those provisions relate to CD Rate
Loans.

SECTION 25.      Representations and Warranties. To induce the
Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Agent to enter into this Amendment, the
Borrower hereby reaffirms, as of the date hereof, its representations and

including Oil and Gas Properties, any Obligor has sold, transferred, abandoned,
released or otherwise disposed of from and after the Effective Date with the
Lenders' consent or in the ordinary course of such Obligor's business or (iii)

Borrower) and additionally represents and warrants as follows:

(a)      The execution, delivery and performance of this
Amendment, the Term Notes, each of the Subject Mortgages (as
hereinafter defined), the Security Agreement and the Financing
Statements (as hereinafter defined) by the Borrower are within the
Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, have received all necessary governmental
approval (if any shall be required), and do not and will not
contravene or conflict with any contractual restriction (unless the
Borrower has not received a binding waiver of such contractual
restrictions, a copy of which waiver must be sent to the Agent), law
or governmental regulation or court decree or order binding on the
Borrower or the Organic Documents of the Borrower, or result in, or
require the creation or imposition of, any Lien on any of the
Borrower's properties, except for the Liens created pursuant to the
Subject Mortgages, the Security Agreement and Financing Statements;

(b)      This Amendment, the Term Notes, the Security
Agreement, each of the Subject Mortgages, the Financing Statements and
the Credit Agreement as amended by the Amendment are the legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the
Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, subject in each
case to the application of equitable principles and subject to the
effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar statutes, judicial decisions or rules of law affecting
creditors' rights generally; and

(c)      All authorizations, approvals, and other actions
required by, notifications to and filings with, any governmental
authority or regulatory body or other Person required for the
Borrower's due execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement,

Financing Statements have been obtained or made, as applicable.

SECTION 26.      Limited Waiver of Certain Defaults. Lenders hereby
waive (i) the Event of Default that occurred under Section 8.1.5 of the Credit
Agreement as a result of Borrower's





16
<PAGE>   17
default under Section 9.1(c) of the John Hancock Note Agreement by Borrower's
exceeding its debt coverage under section 6.18, 7.1(g) and 7.1(h) of the John
Hancock Note Agreement for the period ending April 1, 1997, (ii) the Event of
Default resulting from the Eleven Million Dollars Borrowing Base Deficiency
existing as of May 1, 1996, but only insofar as such deficiency on such date is
concerned, (iii) the Event of Default resulting from noncompliance with clauses
(b) and (c) of Section 7.2.4 for the period ending on December 31, 1995, (iv)
the Event of Default under Section 7.1.7 of the Credit Agreement resulting from
Borrower's failure to deliver an environmental audit by March 1, 1995
(provided, however, Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Agent a duly
executed environmental questionnaire in substantially the form of Annex III on
or before August 15, 1996), and (v) the Event of Default resulting from
Borrower's failure to deliver an annual audit report for Fiscal Year 1995 and
Borrower's failure to deliver the compliance certificate described in Section
7.1.1(b) of the Credit Agreement with respect to Fiscal Year 1995, in each case
within the time frames therein specified; provided, however, that the Lenders
hereby waive (a) such noncompliance with Section 7.1.1(b) until the earlier of
two (2) days after filing such annual report and such compliance certificate
with the Securities and Exchange Commission or May 2, 1996 and (b) such
noncompliance with Section 7.1.7 of the Credit Agreement until August 15, 1996.
The foregoing notwithstanding, however, failure to deliver such annual audit
report and such compliance certificate within two (2) days of filing the same
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but in no event later than May 2,
1996, and/or failure to deliver to the Agent a duly executed environmental
questionnaire as described above on or before August 15, 1996 shall constitute
an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Second
Amendment. Except as noted in the immediately preceding sentence of this
Section 26, nothing contained in this Amendment shall be deemed to be a waiver
or abandonment of any rights or remedies available to the Lenders or the Agent
under the Credit Agreement, applicable law or otherwise nor a waiver of any
Default or Event of Default known or unknown, which may be currently existing
or which may occur in the future. The Agent and Lenders specifically reserve
all their rights and remedies including, without limitation, the right to
declare all Loans and other Obligations immediately due and payable with
respect to any Events of Default which have not been specifically waived
herein.

SECTION 27.      Conditions Precedent; Effectiveness. The

Notes,) in each case in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent
in its sole discretion, together with evidence of the completion (or
satisfactory arrangements for the completion) of all recordings and
filings of the Mortgages, the Security Agreement and the Financing
Statements as may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of the

defined in the Security Agreement) against the properties purported to
be covered thereby (provided that such Liens may be pari passu with
the liens securing the John Hancock Notes); provided further that it
is understood that the property and Assets covered by the Liens in
this clause (iii) have a fair market value in the aggregate of such
property and Assets not in excess of $1,000,000;

benefit of the Secured Parties and to all future such Liens as may be
required pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement as amended
hereby, and to all other transactions set forth herein, together with
copies of all Liens granted to secure the John Hancock Notes which

Amendment and the Subject Mortgages (B) as to its Articles of
Incorporation and By-laws, (C) as to the incumbency and signatures of
those of its officers authorized to act with respect to this Amendment
and the Subject Mortgages; and (D) that the Subject Mortgages, the
Security Agreement and the Financing Statements describe all the
Assets of the Borrower other than Assets having a fair market value in
the aggregate of all such Assets not in excess of $1,000,000;

to be an amendment to the Credit Agreement, and the Credit Agreement, as
amended hereby, is hereby ratified, approved and confirmed in each and every
respect. All references to the Credit Agreement in any other document,

Credit Agreement as amended hereby.

SECTION 29.      Choice of Law; Severability. THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE

<PAGE>   20
THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Whenever possible each provision of this Amendment shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Amendment shall be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Amendment.

SECTION 30.      Counterpart Execution. This Amendment may be executed
in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same instrument, and any party hereto may execute this Amendment by
signing one or more counterparts.

SECTION 31       Binding Effect. This Amendment shall be binding upon
the Borrower, the Lenders, the Collateral Agent and the Agent and their
respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the

OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENTS THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY
NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT
AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES.

THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES.

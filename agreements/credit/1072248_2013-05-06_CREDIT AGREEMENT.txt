Loan Availability; and further provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any
other Loan Documents to the contrary, each Revolving Loan requested by Borrowers under this Agreement shall be subject to Lender’s
approval, which approval may be given or withheld in Lender’s sole and absolute discretion. Revolving Loans made by Lender
may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, borrowed again up to, but not including, the Revolving Loan Maturity
Date, unless the Revolving Loans are otherwise terminated or extended as provided in this Agreement. The Revolving Loans shall
be used by Borrower for the specific purposes permitted hereunder and for no other purpose.







11












(b)          Increase
to Revolving Loan Commitment. Borrowers may request, from time to time, that the Revolving Loan Commitment be increased to
up to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000); and Lender, in its sole discretion, may make available Revolving Loan Commitment increases
to Borrowers. Lender’s election to increase the Revolving Loan Commitment from time to time may be granted or denied by Lender
in its sole and absolute discretion, however, at a minimum, the following conditions must be satisfied, in Lender’s sole
and absolute discretion:





(i)          no
Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing, or result from the applicable increase of the Revolving Loan Commitment;





(ii)         Borrowers
shall have executed and delivered a new or revised Revolving Note;





(iii)        After
giving effect to such increase, the amount of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all Revolving Loans shall not be in
excess of the Revolving Loan Availability; and





(iv)        Lender
shall have reviewed and accepted, in its sole and absolute discretion, the amount and type of current and historical Receipts of
the Borrowers, or other Collateral required for the increase.





(c)          Revolving
Loan Interest and Payments. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving
Loans shall be repaid on or before the Revolving Loan Maturity Date. Principal amounts repaid on the Revolving Note may be re-borrowed.
The principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time shall bear interest at the Interest Rate. Accrued and
unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of all Revolving Loans outstanding from time to time, and other fees and charges
due hereunder shall be payable on a weekly basis on the weekly anniversary date of the Closing Date, or such other date as Lender
and Borrowers may agree upon (provided, however, if no such other agreement is made or reached, then on the weekly anniversary
date of the Closing Date), commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof and on the Revolving Loan Maturity
Date (each a “Payment Date”). Any amount of principal or interest on the Revolving Loans which is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, shall at Lender’s option bear interest payable on
demand at the Default Rate.





(d)          Revolving
Loan Principal Repayments.





(i)          Mandatory
Principal Prepayments; Overadvances. All Revolving Loans hereunder shall be repaid by Borrowers on or before the Revolving
Loan Maturity Date, unless payable sooner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. In the event the aggregate outstanding
principal balance of all Revolving Loans hereunder exceed the Revolving Loan Availability, Borrowers shall, upon notice or demand
from Lender, immediately make such repayments of the Revolving Loans or take such other actions as shall be necessary to eliminate
such excess. Lender shall apply funds received into the Lock Box Account in accordance with Section 2.1(e) below.





(ii)         Optional
Prepayments. Borrowers may, from time to time, prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.







12












(e)          Collections;
Lock Box.





(i)          To
the extent any Customers make or pay any Receipts to any Borrower by a wire transfer or other form of electronic funds transfer,
then each Borrower shall direct and instruct all of such Customers to make all such wire transfer or other electronic fund transfer
payments directly to the Lock Box Account. To the extent any Customers make or pay any Receipts to any Borrower by any other form
other than wire transfer or electronic funds transfer (such as through a check), then each Borrower shall direct all of its Customers
to make and send all such payments and Receipts directly to a post office box designated by, and under the exclusive control of,
Lender (such post office box is referred to herein as the “Lock Box”). Each Borrower hereby agrees to
undertake any and all required actions, execute any required documents, instruments or agreements, or to otherwise do any other
thing required or requested by Lender in order to effectuate the foregoing. Lender shall maintain an account at a financial institution
acceptable to Lender in its sole and absolute discretion (the “Lock Box Account”), which Lock Box Account
shall be maintained in Lender’s name, and into which all Receipts, whether through wires, checks, or any other form, and
all other monies, checks, notes, drafts or other payments of any kind owing or payable to any of the Borrowers, shall be deposited.
If any Borrower, any Affiliate or Subsidiary, any shareholder, officer, director, employee or agent of any Borrower or any Affiliate
or Subsidiary, or any other Person acting for or in concert with any Borrower, shall receive any monies, checks, notes, drafts
or other payments or Receipts, whether from a Customer, as proceeds from Collateral, or form any other source, the applicable Borrower
and each such Person shall receive all such items in trust for, and as the sole and exclusive property of, Lender, and, immediately
upon receipt thereof, shall remit the same (or cause the same to be remitted) in kind to the Lock Box Account.





(ii)         Borrowers
and Lender agree that all payments made to the Lock Box Account, whether in respect of Receipts, as proceeds of Collateral, or
otherwise, will be swept from the Lock Box Account to Lender on each Payment Date to be applied according to the following priorities:
(1) to unpaid fees and expenses due hereunder including, without limitation, any recurring fees due pursuant to Section 2.2
hereof; (2) to accrued but unpaid interest owed under Sections 2.1(c) and 2.4 hereof; (3) if at any time the Lender is not
holding, in the Lock Box Account, an amount equal to at least the Reserve Amount, then all Receipts received into the Lock Box
Account shall be withheld and applied by Lender to amounts required to establish the Reserve Amount, until the Reserve Amount is
reached, which Reserve Amount (or portion thereof) may be kept and maintained in the Lock Box Account during the duration of this
Agreement as additional security for the Obligations; (4) to amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d); and (5) upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, to Lender (including any Reserve Amount then in the Lock Box Account), to reduce the outstanding
Revolving Loan balance to zero (each of the foregoing payments, the “Lock Box Payments”). The amount
remaining in the Lock Box Account following the payment of the Lock Box Payments on each Payment Date (less any amount in the Lock
Box Account withheld and applied by Lender to the Reserve Amount) shall be referred to herein as the “Net Amount”.
The Lender agrees that, provided the Borrowers are in good standing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and provided
no Event of Default exists under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and provided no event has occurred that, with the passage
of time, or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
then until the indebtedness owing by Borrowers to Spagus Capital Partners, LLC (“Spagus”) (the “Spagus
Debt”), a creditor of Borrowers, is paid in full, from the Net Amount, Lender shall pay and deliver to Spagus an
amount equal to $15,000 every two (2) weeks in accordance with the terms of a Subordination Agreement to be entered into simultaneously
herewith between Borrowers, Lender and Spagus. After making the payments contemplated to be made to Spagus, the Net Amount then
remaining, if any, will be transferred to Borrowers from the Lock Box Account via wire transfer or electronic funds transfer to
an account designated by the Borrowers. Once the Spagus Debt has been paid in full, provided the Borrowers are in good standing
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and provided no Event of Default exists under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and provided no event has occurred that, with the passage of time, or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute
an Event of Default under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Net Amount shall be transferred to Borrowers from the
Lock Box Account via wire transfer or electronic funds transfer to an account designated by the Borrowers on the immediately subsequent
Payment Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event at any time: (A) the Net Amount
is not sufficient to make any payment contemplated to be made to Spagus hereunder; or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any other event has occurred that, with the passage of time, or the giving of notice,
or both, would constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, then Lender shall have no obligation
to make any payment to Spagus contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
to the contrary, Lender’s rights and remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall not at any time or in
any way be prejudiced, impaired or adversely affected by any failure of Lender to make any payment to Spagus as contemplated hereby.







13












(iii)
Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable fees, costs and expenses in connection with opening and maintaining of the Lock Box and the
Lock Box Account. All of such reasonable fees, costs and expenses, if not paid by Borrowers within five (5) Business Days of Lender’s
written request, may be paid by Lender and in such event all amounts paid by Lender shall constitute Obligations hereunder, shall
be payable to Lender by Borrowers upon demand, and, until paid, shall bear interest at the Default Rate.





(iv)        It
is intended that all Receipts, and all other checks, drafts, instruments and other items of payment or proceeds of Collateral at
any time received, due or owing to any Borrower from a Customer, any other Person, or otherwise, shall be deposited directly into
the Lock Box Account, and if not deposited directly into the Lock Box Account, shall be immediately remitted or endorsed by Borrowers
to Lender into the Lock Box Account, and, if that remittance or endorsement of any such item shall not be immediately made for
any reason, Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized to remit or endorse the same on each Borrower’s behalf. For purpose of
this Section, each Borrower irrevocably hereby makes, constitutes and appoints Lender (and all Persons designated by Lender for
that purpose) as each Borrower’s true and lawful attorney and agent-in-fact: (A) to endorse such Borrower’s name upon
said Receipts or items of payment and/or proceeds of Collateral and upon any chattel paper, document, instrument, invoice or similar
document or agreement relating to any Receipts of such Borrower; (B) to take control in any manner of any item of payment or proceeds
thereof; and (C) to have access to any lock box or postal box into which any of Borrowers’ mail is deposited, and open and
process all mail addressed to any Borrower and deposited therein.







14












(v)         Lender
may, at any time and from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, whether before or
after notification to any Customer and whether before or after the maturity of any of the Obligations: (A) enforce collection
of any of the Accounts and Receipts of any Borrower or other amounts owed to any Borrower by suit or otherwise; (B) exercise all
of the rights and remedies of each Borrower with respect to Proceedings brought to collect any Accounts, Receipts, or other amounts
owed to each Borrower; (C) surrender, release or exchange all or any part of any Accounts, Receipts, or other amounts owed to each
Borrower, or compromise or extend or renew for any period (whether or not longer than the original period) any indebtedness thereunder;
(D) sell or assign any Account or Receipts of any Borrower, or other amount owed to any Borrower, upon such terms, for such amount
and at such time or times as Lender deems advisable; (E) prepare, file and sign any Borrower’s name on any proof of claim
in bankruptcy or other similar document against any Customer or other Person obligated to any Borrower; (F) have access to any
Borrower’s operating accounts, through such Borrower’s online banking system, or otherwise, to make remittances of
any Receipts deposited therein into the Lock Box Account as required hereby; and (G) do all other acts and things which are necessary,
in Lender’s sole discretion, to fulfill each Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
and to allow Lender to collect the Accounts, Receipts, or other amounts owed to each Borrower. In addition to any other provision
hereof, Lender may at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, at Borrowers’ expense,
notify any parties obligated on any of the Accounts and Receipts to make payment directly to Lender of any amounts due or to become
due thereunder.





(vi)        On
a monthly basis, Lender shall deliver to Borrowers an invoice and an account statement showing all Loans, charges and payments,
which shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Borrowers, unless Borrowers notify Lender in writing, specifying any error
therein, within thirty (30) days of the date such account statement is sent to Borrowers and any such notice shall only constitute
an objection to the items specifically identified.

Monitoring Fee. Borrowers agree to pay to Lender an asset monitoring fee (“Asset Monitoring Fee”)
equal to One Thousand Five-Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($1,500.00), which shall be due and payable on the Closing Date, and thereafter
on the first day of each third (3rd) calendar month during the term of this Agreement. The Asset Monitoring Fee shall
be increased in increments of Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($500.00) each time the Revolving Loan Commitment amount is increased

15












(d)          Due

designee of the Lender), upon demand, or to otherwise be responsible for the payment of, any and all other costs, fees and
expenses, including the reasonable fees, costs, expenses and disbursements of counsel for the Lender and of any experts and
agents, which the Lender may incur or which may otherwise be due and payable in connection with: (i) the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery, recordation, administration, amendment, waiver, subordination, or other modification or
termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents (provided that there shall be no fees for the preparation,
negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement other than as specifically set forth in this Section 2.2);

the Loan Documents. Included in the foregoing shall be the amount of all expenses paid or incurred by Lender in consulting
with counsel concerning any of its rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or under applicable law upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default. All such costs and expenses, if not so immediately paid when due or upon demand thereof,
shall bear interest from the date of outlay until paid, at the Default Rate. All of such costs and expenses shall be
additional Obligations of the Borrowers to Lender secured under the Loan Documents. The provisions of this Subsection shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

monthly fees and interest payable by Borrowers hereunder to Lender for each calendar month during the term hereof shall not be
less than One and Five Tenths Percent (1.5%) of the then applicable Revolving Loan Commitment (the “Minimum Fees”).
In the event during any calendar month during the term of this Agreement, the recurring monthly fees and interest payable by Borrowers
to Lender hereunder are less than the Minimum Fees, then in addition to all such recurring monthly fees and interest payable, the
Borrowers shall pay to Lender, on the next Payment Date, an amount determined by Lender such that when added to the recurring monthly
fees and interest payable to Lender each calendar month hereunder, such amount shall never be less than the Minimum Fees.

Fee.





(i)          Share
Issuance. In consideration of advisory services provided by Lender to Issuing Borrower prior to the Closing Date, the Issuing
Borrower shall pay to Lender a fee equal to $200,000.00 (the “Advisory Fee”). The Advisory Fee shall
be initially paid by the issuance to Lender of 200,000 shares of the Issuing Borrower’s Series A Preferred Stock (the “Advisory
Fee Shares”) in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Section. On the Closing Date, the Issuing Borrower
shall instruct its transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) to issue certificates representing the Advisory
Fee Shares issuable to the Lender hereunder, and shall cause its Transfer Agent to deliver such certificates to Lender within five
(5) Business Days from the Closing Date. In the event such certificates representing the Advisory Fee Shares issuable hereunder
shall not be delivered to the Lender within said five (5) Business Day period, same shall be an immediate default under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents. The Advisory Fee Shares, and all shares of Common Stock issuable upon or in connection with any conversion
of the Advisory Fee Shares (the “Advisory Fee Conversion Shares”), when issued, shall be deemed to be
validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable shares of the Issuing Borrower’s Preferred Stock and Common Stock, as applicable.
The Advisory Fee Shares shall be deemed fully earned as of the date the Borrowers execute this Agreement, regardless of the amount
or number of Revolving Loans made hereunder.







17












(ii)         Adjustments.
It is the intention of the Issuing Borrower and Lender that the Lender shall have the right and be able to convert Advisory Fee
Shares into Advisory Fee Conversion Shares in accordance with the terms and provisions of the certificate of rights and designations
governing the Advisory Fee Shares (the “Certificate of Designations”), and to thereafter sell the Advisory
Fee Conversion Shares and generate net proceeds (net of all brokerage commissions and other fees or charges payable by Lender in
connection with the sale thereof) from such sale equal to the Advisory Fee. In this regard, the Lender shall have the right to
sell the Advisory Fee Conversion Shares in the Principal Trading Market, or otherwise, at any time in accordance with applicable
securities laws. After the earlier to occur of: (A) the conversion of all Advisory Fee Shares and sale of all Advisory Fee Conversion
Shares; or (B) Lender receiving net proceeds from the sale of the Advisory Fee Conversion Shares equal to the Advisory Fee, the
Lender shall deliver to the Issuing Borrower a reconciliation statement showing the net proceeds actually received by the Lender
from the sale of the Advisory Fee Conversion Shares (the “Sale Reconciliation”). If, as of the date of
the delivery by Lender of the Sale Reconciliation, the Lender has not realized and received net proceeds from the sale of the Advisory
Fee Conversion Shares equal to at least the Advisory Fee, as shown on the Sale Reconciliation, then, at Lender’s election:
(I) Borrowers shall be obligated to pay such shortfall to Lender in Dollars by wire transfer to an account designated by Lender
within five (5) Business Days after demand therefor from Lender; or (II) the Issuing Borrower shall immediately take all required
action necessary or required in order to cause the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock to the Lender in an amount sufficient
such that, when sold and the net proceeds thereof are added to the net proceeds from the sale of any of the previously issued and
sold Advisory Fee Conversion Shares, the Lender shall have received total net funds equal to the Advisory Fee. If additional shares
of Common Stock are issued pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, and after the sale of such additional issued shares
of Common Stock, the Lender still has not received net proceeds equal to at least the Advisory Fee, then at Lender’s election:
(I) Borrowers shall be obligated to pay such shortfall to Lender in Dollars by wire transfer to an account designated by Lender
within five (5) Business Days after demand therefor from Lender, in which event, after Lender’s receipt of such cash payment
by Lender, the Lender shall return any then remaining Advisory Fee Shares and Advisory Fee Conversion Shares in its possession
back to the Issuing Borrower; or (II) the Issuing Borrower shall again be required to immediately take all required action necessary
or required in order to cause the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock to the Lender as contemplated above, and such election
by Lender and additional issuances shall continue until the Lender has received the full Advisory Fee, either in Dollars or net
proceeds from the sale of such Common Stock equal to the Advisory Fee. In the event the Lender receives net proceeds from the sale
of Advisory Fee Conversion Shares equal to the Advisory Fee before Lender has converted all Advisory Fee Shares, or sold all Advisory
Fee Conversion Shares issued to Lender hereunder, then the Lender shall return all such remaining Advisory Fee Shares or Advisory
Fee Conversion Shares, as applicable, to the Issuing Borrower. In the event additional Common Stock is required to be issued as
outlined above, the Issuing Borrower shall instruct its Transfer Agent to issue certificates representing such additional shares
of Common Stock to the Lender immediately subsequent to the Lender’s notification to the Issuing Borrower that additional
shares of Common Stock are issuable hereunder, and the Issuing Borrower shall in any event cause its Transfer Agent to deliver
such certificates to Lender within five (5) Business Days following the date Lender notifies the Issuing Borrower that additional
shares of Common Stock are to be issued hereunder. In the event such certificates representing such additional shares of Common
Stock issuable hereunder shall not be delivered to the Lender within said five (5) Business Day period, same shall be an immediate
default under this Agreement and the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.2(h) to the contrary,
at any time on or prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, the Issuing Borrower shall have the right, at any time during such
period, to redeem any Advisory Fee Shares or Advisory Fee Conversion Shares then in the Lender’s possession for an amount
payable by the Issuing Borrower to Lender in Dollars equal to the Advisory Fee, less any net proceeds received by the Lender from
any previous sales of Advisory Fee Conversion Shares. Upon Lender’s receipt of such cash payment in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, the Lender shall return any then remaining Advisory Fee Shares and Advisory Fee Conversion Shares in its possession
back to the Issuing Borrower. In the event the Lender elects to increase the Revolving Loan Commitment as permitted by this Agreement,
the Borrowers agree to pay additional advisory fees to Lender either in cash or in a similar manner as set forth in this Section
2.2(h) through the issuance of additional Advisory Fee Shares or Common Stock, at Lender’s sole discretion, in an amount
to be determined by Lender.





(iii)        Mandatory
Redemption. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Lender has not realized
net proceeds from the sale of Advisory Fee Conversion Shares equal to at least the Advisory Fee by a date that is twelve (12) months
from the Closing Date, then at any time thereafter, the Lender shall have the right, upon written notice to the Issuing Borrower,
to require that the Issuing Borrower redeem all Advisory Fee Shares and Advisory Fee Conversion Shares then in Lender’s possession
for Dollars equal to the Advisory Fee, less any net proceeds received by the Lender from any previous sales of Advisory Fee Conversion
Shares, if any. In the event such redemption notice is given by the Lender, the Issuing Borrower shall redeem the then remaining
Advisory Fee Shares and Advisory Fee Conversion Shares in Lender’s possession for an amount of Dollars equal to the Advisory
Fee, less any net proceeds received by the Lender from any previous sales of Advisory Fee Conversion Shares, if any, payable by
wire transfer to an account designated by Lender within five (5) Business Days from the date the Lender delivers such redemption
notice to the Issuing Borrower.







18












(iv)        Leak-Out
Covenant. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, so long as no Event of Default exists, and
so long as no event has occurred that, with the passage of time, the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an Event of Default,
the Lender agrees that it shall not, during any given calendar week, sell Advisory Fee Conversion Shares in excess of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the average weekly volume of the Common Stock on the Principal Trading Market over the immediately preceding calendar
week, as reported by Bloomberg.





(v)         Surviving
Obligations. The Borrowers agree and acknowledge that notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, or the payment in
full of all of the Borrowers’ Obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, and notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents to the contrary, the Issuing Borrower’s obligations and liability under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the Lender’s Lien and security interest on all Collateral, shall survive, shall
remain valid and effective and shall not be released or terminated, until the Issuing Borrower has fully complied with all of its
obligations with respect to payment of the Advisory Fee, and Lender has generated and received net proceeds from the sale of the
Advisory Fee Conversion Shares (or otherwise received equivalent payment thereof in Dollars as permitted hereunder) equal to the
Advisory Fee.





(i)
Matters with Respect to Common Stock.





(i)          Issuance
of Conversion Shares. The parties hereto acknowledge that pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Note, Lender has the right,
under certain circumstances as more specifically set forth in the Revolving Note, to convert amounts due under the Revolving Note

to issue, or cause the Transfer Agent to issue, any portion of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Revolving Note
(the “Conversion Shares”) to Lender in connection with the exercise by Lender of any of its conversion
rights under the Revolving Note, then the parties hereto acknowledge that Lender shall irrevocably be entitled to deliver to the
Transfer Agent, on behalf of itself and the Issuing Borrower, a “Conversion Notice” (as defined in the Revolving Note)

19












(ii)         Issuance
of Advisory Fee Conversion Shares. The parties hereto acknowledge that pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations
applicable to the Advisory Fee Shares, Lender has the right to convert Advisory Fee Shares into Advisory Fee Conversion Shares.
In the event, for any reason, the Issuing Borrower fails to issue, or cause its Transfer Agent to issue, any portion of the Advisory
Fee Conversion Shares issuable to Lender upon conversion of the Advisory Fee Shares, or any portion thereof, then the parties hereto
acknowledge that Lender shall irrevocably be entitled to deliver to the Transfer Agent, on behalf of itself and the Issuing Borrower,
a “Conversion Notice” (as used and defined in the Certificate of Designations) requesting the issuance of the Advisory

Fee Conversion Shares applicable to the Conversion Notice then being exercised, and surrender to a nationally recognized overnight
courier for delivery to Lender at the address specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate of the Common Stock of the Issuing
Borrower, registered in the name of Lender or its designee, for the number of Advisory Fee Conversion Shares to which Lender shall
be then entitled in accordance with the Certificate of Designations, as set forth in the Conversion Notice.





(iii)        Issuance
of Additional Common Stock Under Section 2.2(h). The parties hereto acknowledge that pursuant to the Section 2.2(h) above,
the Issuing Borrower has agreed to issue, in certain circumstances as outlined in Section 2.2(h), certain shares of the Issuing
Borrower’s Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2(h) above. In the event, for any reason, the Issuing Borrower
fails to issue, or cause its Transfer Agent to issue, any portion of the Common Stock issuable to Lender under Section 2.2(h),
then the parties hereto acknowledge that Lender shall irrevocably be entitled to deliver to the Transfer Agent, on behalf of itself
and the Issuing Borrower, a written instruction requesting the issuance of the shares of Common Stock then issuable in accordance
with Section 2.2(h) above, and the Transfer Agent, provided they are the acting transfer agent for the Issuing Borrower at the
time, shall, and the Issuing Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Transfer Agent to, without any further confirmation
or instructions from the Issuing Borrower, issue such shares of the Issuing Borrower’s Common Stock as directed by Lender,
and surrender to a nationally recognized overnight courier for delivery to Lender at the address specified in the Lender’s
notice, a certificate of the Common Stock of the Issuing Borrower, registered in the name of Lender or its designee, for the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable to Lender in accordance with Section 2.2(h).





(iv)        Removal
of Restrictive Legends. In the event that Lender has any shares of the Issuing Borrower’s Common Stock bearing any restrictive
legends, and Lender, through its counsel or other representatives, submits to the Transfer Agent any such shares for the removal
of the restrictive legends thereon, whether in connection with a sale of such shares pursuant to any exemption to
the registration requirements under the Securities Act or the laws or rules of any Governmental Authority, or otherwise, and the
Issuing Borrower and or its counsel refuses or fails for any reason to render an opinion of counsel or any other documents, certificates
or instructions required for the removal of the restrictive legends, then: (A) to the extent such legends could be lawfully removed
under applicable laws, Issuing Borrower’s failure to provide the required opinion of counsel or any other documents, certificates
or instructions required for the removal of the restrictive legends shall be an immediate Event of Default under this Agreement
and all other Loan Documents; and (B) the Issuing Borrower hereby agrees and acknowledges that Lender is hereby irrevocably and
expressly authorized to have counsel to Lender render any and all opinions and other certificates or instruments which may be required
for purposes of removing such restrictive legends, and the Issuing Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Transfer
Agent to, without any further confirmation or instructions from the Issuing Borrower, issue any such shares without restrictive
legends as instructed by Lender, and surrender to a common carrier for overnight delivery to the address as specified by Lender,
certificates, registered in the name of Lender or its designees, representing the shares of Common Stock to which Lender is entitled,
without any restrictive legends and otherwise freely transferable on the books and records of the Issuing Borrower.

(v)         Authorized
Agent of the Issuing Borrower. The Issuing Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Lender and its counsel and its representatives,
each as the Issuing Borrower’s duly authorized agent and attorney-in-fact for the Issuing Borrower for the purposes of authorizing
and instructing the Transfer Agent to process issuances, transfers and legend removals upon instructions from Lender, or any counsel
or representatives of Lender, as specifically contemplated herein. The authorization and power of attorney granted hereby is coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable so long as any Obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents
remain outstanding, and so long as the Lender owns or has the right to receive, any shares of the Issuing Borrower’s Common
Stock hereunder or under the Revolving Note. In this regard, the Issuing Borrower hereby confirms to the Transfer Agent and the
Lender that it can NOT and will NOT give instructions, including stop orders or otherwise, inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement with regard to the matters contemplated herein, and that the Lender shall have the absolute right to provide
a copy of this Agreement to the Transfer Agent as evidence of the Issuing Borrower’s irrevocable authority for Lender and
Transfer Agent to process issuances, transfers and legend removals upon instructions from Lender, or any counsel or representatives
of Lender, as specifically contemplated herein, without any further instructions, orders or confirmations from the Issuing Borrower.





(vi)        Injunction
and Specific Performance. The Issuing Borrower specifically acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened
breach by the Issuing Borrower of any provision of this Section 2.2(i), the Lender will be irreparably damaged and that damages
at law would be an inadequate remedy if this Agreement were not specifically enforced.  Therefore, in the event of a breach
or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 2.2(i) by the Issuing Borrower, the Lender shall be entitled to obtain, in
addition to all other rights or remedies Lender may have, at law or in equity, an injunction restraining such breach, without being
required to show any actual damage or to post any bond or other security, and/or to a decree for specific performance of the provisions
of this Section 2.2(i).





2.3          Renewal
of Revolving Loans; Non-Renewal of Revolving Loans; Fees. So
long as no Event of Default exists, and so long as no event has occurred that, with the passage
of time, the giving of notice, or both, would constitute an Event of Default, Borrowers shall have the option to renew
the Revolving Loan Commitment and extend the Revolving Loan
Maturity Date for one (1) additional six (6) month period. To exercise
such option, Borrowers shall give written notice to Lender of
Borrowers’ renewal of the Revolving Loan Commitment and
extension of the Revolving Loan Maturity Date for an additional six (6) month period on or before a date that is twenty (20) days
prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date.







21












2.4           Interest
and Fee Computation; Collection of Funds. Interest accrued hereunder shall be payable as set forth in Section 2.1(c)
hereof. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all interest and fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year consisting of 360
days and shall be paid for the actual number of days elapsed. Principal payments submitted in funds not immediately available shall
continue to bear interest until collected. If any payment to be made by Borrowers hereunder or under the Revolving Note shall become
due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time
shall be included in computing any interest in respect of such payment. Any Obligations which are not paid when due (subject to
applicable grace periods) shall bear interest at the Default Rate.





2.5           Automatic
Debit. In order to effectuate the timely payment of any of the Obligations when due, each Borrower hereby authorizes and directs
Lender to make Revolving Loans hereunder to pay the amount of the Obligations.





2.6           Discretionary
Disbursements. Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, may immediately upon notice to Borrowers, disburse any or all proceeds
of the Revolving Loans made or available to Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement to pay any fees, costs, expenses or other amounts
required to be paid by Borrowers hereunder and not so paid. All monies so disbursed shall be a part of the Obligations, payable
by Borrowers on demand from Lender.





2.7           US
Dollars; Currency Risk. All Receipts will be in Dollars. In the event Receipts are not in Dollars, Borrowers shall bear the
risk of Lender’s currency losses, and if Lender suffers a currency loss and the result is to increase the cost to Lender
or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by Lender under this Agreement or under the Revolving Note with respect
thereto, then after demand by Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth reasonably detailed calculations
of the basis of such demand), Borrowers shall pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender for such
increased cost or such reduction. Borrowers hereby authorize Lender to advance or cause an advance of Revolving Loans to pay for
the increased costs or reductions associated with any such currency losses.

Conflicts; Consents and Approvals. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, and the

represents and warrants to Lender that, to its knowledge: (i) no Borrower has generated, used, stored, treated, transported, manufactured,

filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC or any other Governmental
Authority (all of the foregoing filed within the two (2) years preceding the date hereof or amended after the date hereof and
all exhibits included therein and financial statements and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein,
being hereinafter referred to as the “SEC Documents”). Except as set forth in Schedule 7.10,
the Issuing Borrower is current with its filing obligations under the Exchange Act and all SEC Documents have been filed on a
timely basis or the Issuing Borrower has received a valid extension of such time of filing and has filed any such SEC Document
prior to the expiration of any such extension. The Issuing Borrower represents and warrants that true and complete copies of the
SEC Documents are available on the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) at no charge to Lender, and Lender acknowledges that
it may retrieve all SEC Documents from such website and Lender’s access to such SEC Documents through such website shall
constitute delivery of the SEC Documents to Lender; provided, however, that if Lender is unable to obtain any of such SEC Documents
from such website at no charge, as result of such website not being available or any other reason beyond Lender’s control,
then upon request from Lender, the Issuing Borrower shall deliver to Lender true and complete copies of such SEC Documents. As
of their respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and
none of the SEC Documents, at the time they were filed with the SEC, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. None of the statements made in any such SEC Documents is, or has been, required to
be amended or updated under applicable law (except for such statements as have been amended or updated in subsequent filings prior
the date hereof, which amendments or updates are also part of the SEC Documents). As of their respective dates, the consolidated
financial statements of the Issuing Borrower and its Subsidiaries included in the SEC Documents (the “Financial Statements”)
complied in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. All of the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, during the
periods involved (except: (i) as may be otherwise indicated in such Financial Statements or the notes thereto; or (ii) in the
case of unaudited interim statements, to the extent they may exclude footnotes or may be condensed or summary statements), and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Borrower and all of its Subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). To the knowledge of each Borrower and its officers, no other information
provided by or on behalf of any Borrower to the Lender which is not included in the SEC Documents contains any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstance under which they are or were made, not misleading.







29












7.11        Absence
of Certain Changes. Since the date the last of the SEC Documents was filed with the SEC, none of the following have occurred:

has been no event or circumstance of any nature whatsoever that has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in,
a Material Adverse Effect; or

knowledge, threatened, against any Borrower or their respective officers, managers, members or shareholders, or against or affecting
any of their respective assets. In addition, there is no outstanding judgments, orders, writs, decrees or other similar matters
or items against or affecting any Borrower, its business or assets. No Borrower has received any material complaint from any Customer,
supplier, vendor or employee. Each Borrower has duly filed all applicable foreign and U.S. income or other tax returns and has
paid all foreign and U.S. income or other taxes when due. There is no Proceeding, controversy or objection pending or threatened
in respect of any tax returns of any Borrower.





7.13        Event
of Default. No Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and no event has occurred and is continuing which, with the
lapse of time, the giving of notice, or both, would constitute such an Event of Default under this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, and no Borrower is in default (without regard to grace or cure periods) under any contract or agreement to which
it is a party or by which any of their respective assets are bound.







30












7.14        ERISA
Obligations. To the knowledge of each Borrower, no Borrower has or has ever had any Employee Plans subject to ERISA, and no
Borrower has any obligations or liabilities arising under ERISA of a character which if unpaid or unperformed might result in the
imposition of a Lien against any of its properties or assets.





7.15        Adverse
Circumstances. No condition, circumstance, event, agreement, document, instrument, restriction, litigation or Proceeding (or
threatened litigation or Proceeding or basis therefor) exists which: (i) could adversely affect the validity or priority of the

parties thereto relating to the subject matter thereof. Except for those provided to Lender prior to the Closing Date, there are
no outstanding offers, bids, proposals or quotations made by any Borrower which, if accepted, would create a Material Contract

required to be performed under the terms of each of the Material Contracts by any party thereto have been fully performed by all
parties thereto, and no party to any Material Contracts is in default with respect to any term or condition thereof, nor has any
event occurred which, through the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder or would
cause the acceleration or modification of any obligation of any party thereto or the creation of any lien, claim, charge or other
encumbrance upon any of the assets or properties of any Borrower. Further, no Borrower has received any notice, nor does any Borrower
have any knowledge, of any pending or contemplated termination of any of the Material Contracts and, no such termination is proposed

encumbrances or restrictions on the transfer or use of same. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, the assets and
properties of each Borrower are in good operating condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are free of any latent
or patent defects which might impair their usefulness, and are suitable for the purposes for which they are currently used and
for the purposes for which they are proposed to be used.





7.20         Intellectual
Property. Each Borrower owns or possesses adequate and legally enforceable rights or licenses to use all trademarks, trade
names, service marks, service mark registrations, service names, patents, patent rights, copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals,

copyrights, inventions, licenses, service names, service marks, service mark registrations, trade secret or other intellectual
property rights of others, and, to the knowledge of each Borrower, there is no claim, demand or Proceeding, or other demand of
any nature being made or brought against, or to each Borrowers’ knowledge, being threatened against, any Borrower regarding
trademark, trade name, patents, patent rights, invention, copyright, license, service names, service marks, service mark registrations,
trade secret or other intellectual property infringement; and no Borrower is aware of any facts or circumstances which might give
rise to any of the foregoing.





7.21         Labor

employees of any Borrower is a member of a union and each Borrower believes that its relations with its employees are good. To
the knowledge of each Borrower and its officers, each Borrower has complied in all material respects with all laws, rules, ordinances

of recognized financial responsibility, covering its properties, assets and business against losses and risks normally insured
against by other corporations or entities in the same or similar lines of businesses as the Borrowers are engaged and in coverage
amounts which are prudent and typically and reasonably carried by such other corporations or entities (the “Insurance
Policies”). Such Insurance Policies are in full force and effect, and all premiums due thereon have been paid. None
of the Insurance Policies will lapse or terminate as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Borrower
has complied with the provisions of such Insurance Policies. No Borrower has been refused any insurance coverage sought or applied
for and no Borrower has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing Insurance Policies as and when such

of any Borrower.

risks. Prior to the date of the funding of any Loans under this Agreement, each Borrower shall deliver to Lender a certificate
setting forth in summary form the nature and extent of the insurance maintained pursuant to this Section. All such policies of
insurance must be satisfactory to Lender in relation to the amount and term of the Obligations and type and value of the Collateral
and assets of each Borrower, shall identify Lender as sole/lender’s loss payee and as an additional insured. In the event
any Borrower fail to provide Lender with evidence of the insurance coverage required by this Section or at any time hereafter shall
fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies of insurance required above, or to pay any premium in whole or in part relating
thereto, then Lender, without waiving or releasing any obligation or default by any Borrower hereunder, may at any time (but shall
be under no obligation to so act), obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premium and take any other action
with respect thereto, which Lender deems advisable. This insurance coverage: (i) may, but need not, protect any Borrower’s
interest in such property, including, but not limited to, the Collateral; and (ii) may not pay any claim made by, or against, any
Borrower in connection with such property, including, but not limited to, the Collateral. Any Borrower may later cancel any such
insurance purchased by Lender, but only after providing Lender with evidence that the insurance coverage required by this Section
is in force. The costs of such insurance obtained by Lender, through and including the effective date such insurance coverage is
canceled or expires, shall be payable on demand by Borrowers to Lender, together with interest at the Default Rate on such amounts
until repaid and any other charges by Lender in connection with the placement of such insurance. The costs of such insurance, which
may be greater than the cost of insurance which any Borrower may be able to obtain on its own, together with interest thereon at
the Default Rate and any other charges by Lender in connection with the placement of such insurance may be added to the total Obligations
due and owing to the extent not paid by any applicable Borrower.

amend any Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
to the extent necessary to keep the Employee Plan qualified, and to cause the Employee Plan to be administered and operated in

undertake ongoing and continuing due diligence reviews of Borrowers and their business and operations. Such ongoing due diligence
reviews may include, and each Borrower does hereby allow Lender, to conduct site visits and field examinations of the office locations

sole and absolute discretion. In this regard, in order to cover Lender’s expenses of the ongoing due diligence reviews and
any site visits or field examinations which Lender may undertake from time to time while this Agreement is in effect, the Borrowers
shall pay to Lender, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of an invoice or demand therefor from Lender, a fee of up to $8,000
per year (based on four (4) expected filed audits and ongoing due diligence of $2,000 per audit) to cover such ongoing expenses.
Failure to pay such fee as and when required shall be deemed an Event of Default under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents.
The foregoing notwithstanding, from and after the occurrence of an Event of Default or any event which with notice, lapse of time
or both, would become an Event of Default, Lender may conduct site visits, field examinations and other ongoing reviews of each
Borrower’s records, assets and operations at any time, in its sole discretion, without any limitations in terms of number
of site visits or examinations and without being limited to the fee hereby contemplated, all at the sole expense of Borrowers.

Person, which may have a Material Adverse Effect.





10.16      Notice
of Default. Each Borrower shall, promptly, but not more than five (5) days after the commencement thereof, give notice to Lender
in writing of the occurrence of an Event of Default or of any event which, with the lapse of time, the giving of notice or both,

45












10.17      Environmental
Matters. If any release or threatened release or other disposal of Hazardous Substances shall occur or shall have occurred
on any real property or any other assets of any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Borrower, such Borrower shall cause
the prompt containment and/or removal of such Hazardous Substances and the remediation and/or operation of such real property or
other assets as necessary to comply with all Environmental Laws and to preserve the value of such real property or other assets.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower shall comply with any Federal or state judicial or administrative

10.18      Reporting
Status; Listing. So long as this Agreement remains in effect, and for so long as Lender owns, legally or beneficially, any
of the Advisory Fee Shares, Advisory Fee Conversion Shares, or other shares of Common Stock, or has the right to receive any additional
shares of Common Stock, the Issuing Borrower shall: (i) file in a timely manner all reports required to be filed under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any securities laws and regulations thereof applicable to the Borrower of any state of
the United States, or by the rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority or the Principal Trading Market, and, to provide
a copy thereof to the Lender promptly after such filing; (ii) not terminate its status as an issuer required to file reports
under the Exchange Act, even if the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder would otherwise permit such termination;
(iii) if required by the rules and regulations of the Principal Trading Market or any other Governmental Authority, promptly secure
the listing of the Advisory Fee Conversion Shares and any other shares of the Issuing Borrower’s Common Stock issued to Lender
under any Loan Documents upon the Principal Trading Market (subject to official notice of issuance) and, take
all reasonable action under its control to maintain the continued listing, quotation and trading of its Common Stock on the Principal
Trading Market, and the Issuing Borrower shall comply in all respects with the Issuing Borrower’s reporting, filing

and such other Governmental Authorities, as applicable. The Issuing Borrower shall promptly provide to Lender copies of any notices
it receives from the SEC, any Principal Trading Market, or any other Governmental Authority, to the extent any such notices could
in any way have or be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.





10.19      Rule
144. With a view to making available to Lender the benefits of Rule 144 under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”),
or any similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit Lender to sell the Advisory Fee Conversion Shares or other
shares of Common Stock issued to Lender under any Loan Documents to the public without registration, the Issuing Borrower represents
and warrants that: (i) the Issuing Borrower is, and has been for a period of at least ninety (90) days immediately preceding the
date hereof, subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; (ii) the Issuing Borrower has filed
all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the twelve (12) months preceding the Closing Date (or
for such shorter period that the Issuing Borrower was required to file such reports); and (iii) the Issuing Borrower is not an
issuer defined as a “Shell Company” (as hereinafter defined). For the purposes hereof, the term “Shell
Company” shall mean an issuer that meets that description defined under Rule 144. In addition, so long as Lender
owns, legally or beneficially, any securities of the Issuing Borrower, the Issuing Borrower shall, at its sole expense:







46












(a)          Make,
keep and ensure that adequate current public information with respect to the Issuing Borrower, as required in accordance with Rule
144, is publicly available;





(b)          furnish
to the Lender, promptly upon reasonable request: (A) a written statement by the Issuing Borrower that it has complied with the
reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act; and (b) such other information as may be reasonably
requested by Lender to permit the Lender to sell any of the Advisory Fee Shares or other shares of Common Stock acquired hereunder
or under the Revolving Note pursuant to Rule 144, without limitation or restriction; and





(c)          promptly
at the request of Lender, give the Issuing Borrower’s Transfer Agent instructions to the effect that, upon the Transfer Agent’s
receipt from Lender of a certificate (a “Rule 144 Certificate”) certifying
that Lender’s holding period (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Rule 144) for any portion of the Advisory
Fee Conversion Shares or shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Revolving Note which Lender proposes to sell (or
any portion of such shares which Lender is not presently selling, but for which Lender desires to remove any restrictive legends
applicable thereto) (the “Securities Being Sold”) is not less than six (6) months, and receipt by the
Transfer Agent of the “Rule 144 Opinion” (as hereinafter defined) from the Issuing Borrower or its counsel (or from
Lender and its counsel as permitted below), the Transfer Agent is to effect the transfer (or issuance of a new certificate without
restrictive legends, if applicable) of the Securities Being Sold and issue to Lender or transferee(s) thereof one or more stock
certificates representing the transferred (or re-issued) Securities Being Sold without any restrictive legend and without recording
any restrictions on the transferability of such shares on the Transfer Agent’s books and records. In this regard, upon Lender’s
request, the Issuing Borrower shall have an affirmative obligation to cause its counsel to promptly issue to the Transfer Agent
a legal opinion providing that, based on the Rule 144 Certificate, the Securities Being Sold may be sold pursuant to the provisions
of Rule 144, even in the absence of an effective registration statement, or re-issued without any restrictive legends pursuant
to the provisions of Rule 144, even in the absence of an effective registration statement (the “Rule 144 Opinion”).
If the Transfer Agent requires any additional documentation in connection with any proposed transfer (or re-issuance) by Lender
of any Securities Being Sold, the Issuing Borrower shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Transfer Agent or to
any other Person, all such additional documentation as may be necessary to effectuate the transfer (or re-issuance) of the Securities
Being Sold and the issuance of an unlegended certificate to any such Lender or any transferee thereof, all at the Issuing Borrower’s
expense. Any and all fees, charges or expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred
by Lender in connection with issuance of any such shares, or the removal of any restrictive legends thereon, or the transfer of
any such shares to any assignee of Lender, shall be paid by the Issuing Borrower, and if not paid by the Issuing Borrower, the
Lender may, but shall not be required to, pay any such fees, charges or expenses, and the amount thereof, together with interest
thereon at the highest non-usurious rate permitted by law, from the date of outlay, until paid in full, shall be due and payable
by the Issuing Borrower to Lender immediately upon demand therefor, and all such amounts advanced by the Lender shall be additional
Obligations due under this Agreement and the Revolving Note and secured under the Loan Documents. In the event that the Issuing
Borrower and/or its counsel refuses or fails for any reason to render the Rule 144 Opinion or any other documents, certificates
or instructions required to effectuate the transfer (or re-issuance) of the Securities Being Sold and
the issuance of an unlegended certificate to any such Lender or any transferee thereof, then: (A) to the extent the Securities
Being Sold could be lawfully transferred (or re-issued) without restrictions under applicable laws, Issuing Borrower’s failure
to promptly provide the Rule 144 Opinion or any other documents, certificates or instructions required to
effectuate the transfer (or re-issuance) of the Securities Being Sold and the issuance of an unlegended certificate to any such
Lender or any transferee thereof shall be an immediate Event of Default under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents;
and (B) the Issuing Borrower hereby agrees and acknowledges that Lender is hereby irrevocably and expressly authorized to have
counsel to Lender render any and all opinions and other certificates or instruments which may be required for purposes of effectuating
the transfer (or re-issuance) of the Securities Being Sold and the issuance of an unlegended certificate to any such Lender or
any transferee thereof, and the Issuing Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Transfer Agent to, without
any further confirmation or instructions from the Issuing Borrower, transfer or re-issue any such Securities Being Sold as instructed
by Lender and its counsel.







47












10.20      Reservation
of Shares. The Issuing Borrower shall take all action reasonably necessary to at all times have authorized, and reserved for
the purpose of issuance, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall be necessary to effect the full conversion of the Revolving
Note in accordance with its terms (the “Share Reserve”). If at any time the Share Reserve is insufficient
to effect the full conversion of the Revolving Note then outstanding, the Issuing Borrower shall increase the Share Reserve accordingly.
If the Issuing Borrower does not have sufficient authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock available to increase the Share
Reserve, the Issuing Borrower shall call and hold a special meeting of the shareholders within forty-five (45) days of such occurrence,
or take action by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, if possible, for
the sole purpose of increasing the number of shares authorized. Issuing Borrower’s management shall recommend to the shareholders
to vote in favor of increasing the number of shares of Common Stock authorized.

days after Borrowers receive notice or knowledge from any source of such failure to perform or default in performance (provided
that if the failure to perform or default in performance is not capable of being cured, in Lender’s sole discretion, then
the cure period set forth herein shall not be applicable and the failure or default shall be an immediate Event of Default hereunder).





12.4         Default
under Loan Documents. Any failure to perform or default in the performance by any Borrower that continues after applicable
grace and cure periods under any covenant, condition or agreement contained in any of the other Loan Documents or any other agreement

under Other Obligations. Any default by any Borrower in the payment of principal, interest or any other sum for any other obligation
beyond any period of grace provided with respect thereto or in the performance of any, other term, condition or covenant contained
in any agreement (including, but not limited to, any capital or operating lease or any agreement in connection with the deferred
purchase price of property), the effect of which default is to cause or permit the holder of such obligation (or the other party
to such other agreement) to cause such obligation or agreement to become due prior to its stated maturity, to terminate such other
agreement, or to otherwise modify or adversely affect such obligation or agreement in a manner that could have a Material Adverse
Effect on such Borrower.





12.6         Assignment
for Creditors. Any Borrower makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, fails to pay, or admits in writing its inability
to pay its debts as they mature; or if a trustee of any substantial part of the assets of any Borrower is applied for or appointed,
and in the case of such trustee being appointed in a Proceeding brought against such Borrower, such Borrower, by any action or
failure to act indicates its approval of, consent to, or acquiescence in such appointment and such appointment is not vacated,

insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation law or statute of the federal government or any state government,
and in the case of any such Proceeding being instituted against any Borrower: (i) such Borrower, by any action or failure to act,
indicates its approval of, consent to or acquiescence therein; or (ii) an order shall be entered approving the petition in such
Proceedings and such order is not vacated, stayed on appeal or otherwise shall not have ceased to continue in effect within sixty
(60) days after the entry thereof.

The entry of any judgment, decree, levy, attachment, garnishment or other process, or the filing of any Lien against the property
of any Borrower for an amount in excess of $50,000 and which is not fully covered by insurance and such judgment or other process

determined by Lender in its sole discretion, unless such judgment or other process shall have been, within sixty (60) days
from the entry thereof: (i) bonded over to the satisfaction of Lender and appealed; (ii) vacated; or (iii) discharged.

Adverse Effect. The occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect.

shall not constitute an Event of Default if: (i) it arises out of an event or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of any
Borrower (for example, but not by way of limitation, a transfer of ownership interest due to death or incapacity); and (ii) within
sixty (60) days after such Change in Control, such Borrower provides Lender with information concerning the identity and qualifications
of the individual or individuals who will be in Control, and such individual or individuals shall be acceptable to Lender, in Lender’s
sole discretion.





12.11       Collateral
Impairment. The entry of any judgment, decree, levy, attachment, garnishment or other process, or the filing of any Lien against,

and appealed; (ii) vacated; or (iii) discharged, or the loss, theft, destruction, seizure or forfeiture, or the occurrence of any
material deterioration or impairment of any of the Collateral or any of the Collateral under any security agreement securing any
of the Obligations, or any material decline or depreciation in the value or market price thereof (whether actual or reasonably
anticipated), which causes the Collateral, in the sole opinion of Lender acting in good faith, to become unsatisfactory as to value
or character, or which causes Lender to reasonably believe that it is insecure and that the likelihood for repayment of the Obligations
is or will soon be impaired, time being of the essence. The cause of such deterioration, impairment, decline or depreciation shall
include, but is not limited to, the failure by any Borrower to do any act deemed reasonably necessary by Lender to preserve and
maintain the value and collectability of the Collateral.





13.         REMEDIES.





Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have all rights, powers and remedies set forth in the Loan Documents,
in any written agreement or instrument (other than this Agreement or the Loan Documents) relating to any of the Obligations or
any security therefor, or as otherwise provided at law or in equity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lender may,
at its option, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, declare its commitments to Borrowers to be
terminated and all Obligations to be immediately due and payable; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default under either Section 12.6, “Assignment for Creditors”, or Section 12.7, “Bankruptcy”,
all commitments of Lender to Borrowers shall immediately terminate and all Obligations shall be automatically due and payable,
all without demand, notice or further action of any kind required on the part of Lender. The Borrowers hereby waive any and all
presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and all other notices and demands in connection with the enforcement of Lender’s
rights under the Loan Documents, and hereby consent to, and waive notice of release, with or without consideration, of the Borrowers
or of any Collateral, notwithstanding anything contained herein or in the Loan Documents to the contrary.







50












In addition to all
other rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity, in the event the Borrowers fail to pay and satisfy all Obligations
hereunder by the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, as same may be extended in accordance with Section 2.3 hereof, then Lender shall
have the absolute right to demand that Issuing Borrower issue to Lender a number of shares of its Common Stock equal to 4.99% of
the then issued and outstanding number of shares of Common Stock of the Issuing Borrower. In that regard, upon written notice from
Lender to Issuing Borrower following the Borrowers’ failure to pay and satisfy all Obligations hereunder by the Revolving
Loan Maturity Date, as extended, the Issuing Borrower shall instruct its Transfer Agent to issue certificates for the shares contemplated
by this paragraph issuable to the Lender or its nominee, and shall cause its Transfer Agent to deliver such certificates to Lender
or its nominee within five (5) Business Days from the date written demand therefor is made. All of the terms and provisions of
Section 2.2(i) shall be applicable to the shares of Common Stock issuable under this paragraph. The shares of Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this paragraph, if and when issued, shall be shall be deemed to be validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable shares
of the Issuing Borrower’s Common Stock.





No Event of Default
shall be waived by Lender, except and unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Lender. No failure or delay on the part of
Lender in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver of the exercise of the same or any other right
at any other time; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy hereunder. There shall be no obligation on the part of Lender to exercise
any remedy available to Lender in any order. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided at law or in equity. Each Borrower agrees that in the event that any Borrower fails to perform, observe or discharge any
of its Obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, the Revolving Note, and other Loan Documents, or any other agreements with
Lender, no remedy of law will provide adequate relief to Lender, and further agrees that Lender shall be entitled to temporary
and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.

52












14.6        MANDATORY
FORUM SELECTION.  TO INDUCE LENDER TO MAKE THE LOANS, EACH BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISING UNDER,

Loans. The Credit Parties may not sell or assign this Agreement, any Loan Document or any other agreement with Lender, or any portion
thereof, either voluntarily or by operation of law, nor delegate any of its duties of obligations hereunder or thereunder, without
the prior written consent of Lender, which consent may be withheld in Lender’s sole and absolute discretion. This Agreement
shall be binding upon Lender and the Credit Parties and their respective legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.
All references herein to a Borrower shall be deemed to include any successors, whether immediate or remote. In the case of a joint
venture or partnership, the term “Borrower” shall be deemed to include all joint venturers or partners thereof, who
shall be jointly and severally liable hereunder.





14.8        Confidentiality.
Each of the parties hereto shall keep confidential any information obtained from the other party (except information publicly available
or in such party’s domain prior to disclosure of such information from the other party hereto, and except as required by
applicable laws) and shall promptly return to the other party all schedules, documents, instruments, work papers and other written
information without retaining copies thereof, previously furnished by it as a result of this Agreement or in connection herewith.







53












14.9        Publicity.
Lender shall have the right to approve, before issuance, any press release or any other public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby made by Borrowers; provided, however, that Borrowers shall be entitled, without the prior approval of Lender,
to issue any press release or other public disclosure with respect to such transactions required under applicable securities or
other laws or regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrowers shall use their best efforts to consult Lender in connection
with any such press release or other public disclosure prior to its release and Lender shall be provided with a copy thereof upon
release thereof. Lender shall have the right to make any press release with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby without
Borrowers’ approval. In addition, with respect to any press release to be made by Lender, Borrowers hereby authorize and

shall be deemed to be contracts made under and governed by the internal laws of the State of Nevada, and for all purposes shall
be construed in accordance with the laws of such State, without giving effect to the choice of law provisions of such State.





14.12      Enforceability.
Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by, unenforceable or invalid under any jurisdiction, such provision
shall as to such jurisdiction, be severable and be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating
the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.





14.13      Survival
of Borrower’s Representations. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by any Borrower herein
shall, notwithstanding any investigation by Lender, be deemed material and relied upon by Lender and shall survive the making and
execution of this Agreement and the Loan Documents and the issuance of the Revolving Note, and shall be deemed to be continuing
representations and warranties until such time as each Borrower has fulfilled all of its Obligations to Lender, and Lender has
been paid in full. Lender, in extending financial accommodations to Borrowers, is expressly acting and relying on the aforesaid
representations and warranties.





14.14      Extensions
of Lender’s Commitment and the Revolving Note. This Agreement shall secure and govern the terms of any extensions or
renewals of Lender’s commitment hereunder and the Revolving Note pursuant to the execution of any modification, extension
or renewal note executed by Borrowers and accepted by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion in substitution for the Revolving
Note.

and observance by each Borrower of each covenant, agreement, provision and term of this Agreement.







54












14.16      Counterparts.

which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.





14.17      Electronic
Signatures. Lender is hereby authorized to rely upon and accept as an original any Loan Documents or other communication which
is sent to Lender by facsimile, telegraphic or other electronic transmission (each, a “Communication”)
which Lender in good faith believes has been signed by a Borrower and has been delivered to Lender by a properly authorized representative
of a Borrower, whether or not that is in fact the case. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender shall not be obligated to accept
any such Communication as an original and may in any instance require that an original document be submitted to Lender in lieu
of, or in addition to, any such Communication.





14.18      Notices.
Any notices, consents, waivers, or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must
be in writing and in each case properly addressed to the party to receive the same in accordance with the information below, and

14.19      Indemnification.
Each Borrower agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless Lender and all of its officers, directors, employees and agents
(including, without limitation, those retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each, a “Lender
Indemnitee” and collectively, the “Lender Indemnitees”) from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, Proceedings, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and distributions of any
kind or nature (including, without limitation, the disbursements and the reasonable fees of counsel for each Lender Indemnitee
thereto), which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Lender Indemnitee (whether direct, indirect or consequential
and whether based on any federal, state or local laws or regulations, including, without limitation, securities, Environmental
Laws and commercial laws and regulations, under common law or in equity, or based on contract or otherwise) in any manner relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, or any act, event or transaction related or attendant thereto,
the preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, including, but not limited to, the making or
issuance and management of the Loans, the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans, the enforcement of Lender’s rights
and remedies under this Agreement, the Loan Documents, the Revolving Note, any other instruments and documents delivered hereunder,
or under any other agreement between Borrowers and Lender; provided, however, that Borrowers shall not have any obligations
hereunder to any Lender Indemnitee with respect to matters caused by or resulting from the willful misconduct or gross negligence
of such Lender Indemnitee. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable
because it violates any law or public policy, Borrowers shall satisfy such undertaking to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law. Any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, cost or expense covered by this indemnity shall be paid to each Lender Indemnitee
on demand, and, failing prompt payment, shall, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date incurred by each
Lender Indemnitee until paid by Borrowers, be added to the Obligations of Borrowers and be secured by the Collateral. The provisions
of this Section shall survive the satisfaction and payment of the other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.







56












14.20      Release.
In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, each Borrower hereby agrees to fully, finally and forever
release and forever discharge and covenant not to sue Lender, and/or and its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions,
and their respective attorneys, officers, directors, agents, shareholders, members, employees, predecessors, successors, assigns,
personal representatives, partners, heirs and executors from any and all debts, fees, attorneys’ fees, liens, costs, expenses,
damages, sums of money, accounts, bonds, bills, covenants, promises, judgments, charges, demands, claims, causes of action, suits,
Proceedings, liabilities, expenses, obligations or contracts of any kind whatsoever, whether in law or in equity, whether asserted
or unasserted, whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent, under statute or otherwise, from the beginning of time through the
Closing Date, including, without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, any and all claims relating to or arising out
of any financing transactions, credit facilities, debentures, security agreements, and other agreements including, without limitation,
each of the Loan Documents, entered into by any Borrower with Lender and any and all claims that any Borrower does not
know or suspect to exist, whether through ignorance, oversight, error, negligence, or otherwise, and which, if known, would materially
affect their decision to enter into this Agreement or the related Loan Documents.





14.21      Interpretation.
If any provision in this Agreement requires judicial or similar interpretation, the judicial or other such body interpreting or
construing such provision shall not apply the assumption that the terms hereof shall be more strictly construed against one party
because of the rule that an instrument must be construed more strictly against the party which itself or through its agents prepared
the same. The parties hereby agree that all parties and their agents have participated in the preparation hereof equally.





14.22      Compliance
with Federal Law. The Credit Parties shall: (i) ensure that no Person who owns a controlling interest in or otherwise controls
a Credit Party is or shall be listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person List or other similar lists maintained
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the Department of the Treasury, included in any Executive
Orders or any other similar lists from any Governmental Authority, foreign or national; (ii) not use or permit the use of the proceeds
of the Loans to violate any of the foreign asset control regulations of OFAC or any enabling statute or Executive Order relating
thereto, or any other similar national or foreign governmental regulations; and (iii) comply, and cause each of such Credit Party’s
Subsidiaries to comply, with all applicable Lender Secrecy Act (“BSA”) laws and regulations, as amended.
As required by federal law and Lender’s policies and practices, Lender may need to obtain, verify and record certain customer
identification information and documentation in connection with opening or maintaining accounts or establishing or continuing to
provide services.





14.23      Joint
and Several Liability. The liability of all Borrowers hereunder for the Obligations, or for the performance of any other term,
condition, covenant or agreement of any Borrower hereunder, shall be joint and several.

Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement









On May 20, 2011, Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation and certain of their domestic subsidiaries (collectively "Fairchild") entered into a $400 million, five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Facility") the terms of which are set forth in a Credit Agreement dated as of May 20, 2011 among Fairchild, the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, as administrative agent.  At closing, Fairchild paid off all indebtedness under its old credit facility using approximately $19 million in cash and $300 million of indebtedness under the new Facility. The old credit facility was terminated coincident with the closing of the Facility.
The new Facility includes the following features:
- $400 million revolving credit facility;
- $50 million availability for the issuance of letters of credit;
- $10 million availability for swingline loans for short-term borrowings;
Except in the case of a default and subject to customary closing conditions, Fairchild has the ability to increase the size of the Facility from time-to-time on one or more occasions in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $150 million;
Fairchild's obligations under the Facility are guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of 100% of the equity interests in the company's domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity interests of certain of the company's first-tier non-U.S. subsidiaries.  Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for a senior secured credit agreement of this nature. The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on asset sales, mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends, investments and transactions with the company's affiliates. The Credit Agreement contains only two financial covenants: (i) a maximum leverage ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted EBITDA") for the trailing four consecutive quarters of 3.25 to 1.00 and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the trailing four consecutive quarters of at least 3.0 to 1.0.  The Facility provides for LIBOR based borrowings at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.75%.
The above description of the Credit Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 26, 2011. A copy of the company's press release announcing that the company has entered into the Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this current report on Form 8-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.















Item 1.02.    Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement









Concurrent with Fairchild's entry into the new Facility as described in Item 1.01 above, the company terminated its previous credit facility, dated as of June 26, 2006 between Fairchild and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Administrative Agent (the "2006 Credit Agreement").  On May 20, 2011, Fairchild paid all principal outstanding and interest due under the 2006 Credit Agreement.

Thereafter, each change in the Applicable Rate resulting from a publicly announced change in the Debt Rating shall be effective during the period commencing on the date of the public announcement thereof and ending on the date immediately preceding
the effective date of the next such change.
2.07 Interest.
(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i)each Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii)each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
(b) In the event any amount due hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, any interest payment) is not paid when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), the Borrower shall pay
interest on such unpaid amount (including, without limitation, interest on interest) at a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due
amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.
(c) Subject to
Section 8.14, interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein; provided that if the Borrower delivers a Loan Notice in
accordance with Section 2.02(a) with respect to the interest due on an Interest Payment Date prior to the Maturity Date and satisfies the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 on such Interest Payment Date, the interest




22








payment due on such Interest Payment Date may be paid from the proceeds of a Loan in an equivalent amount, unless such amount would exceed the Commitment
existing on such date. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
2.08 Fees.
(a) Facility Fee. Subject to Section 8.14, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender a facility fee equal to the applicable facility fee rate based on the Debt Rating as set forth in the definition of Applicable Rate
multiplied by the actual daily amount of the Commitment, regardless of usage. The facility fee shall accrue at all times from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Debt Rating during any
quarter, the facility fee shall be computed separately for each period during such quarter that each such Debt Rating was in effect. The facility fee shall accrue at all times, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in
Article III are not met.
(b) Utilization Fee. Subject to Section 8.14, the Borrower shall pay to
the Lender a utilization fee equal to the applicable utilization fee rate based on the Debt Rating as set forth in the definition of Applicable Rate multiplied by the actual daily aggregate Outstanding Amount of Loans for each day that such
aggregate Outstanding Amount exceeds 50% of the Commitment. The utilization fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after
the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The utilization fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears. The utilization fee shall accrue at all times, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article III are not
met.
2.09 Computation of Interest. Computation of interest on Base Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or
366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed. Computation of all other types of interest and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed, which results in a higher
yield to the payee thereof than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such
portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.
2.10
Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by the Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by the Lender. The accounts or records maintained by the Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans
made by the Lender to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect
to the Loans. Upon the request of the Lender, the Loans may be evidenced by a Note, in addition to such accounts or records. The Lender may attach schedules to the Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of the
applicable Loans and payments with respect thereto.


23







2.11 Payments Generally.
(a) Except as set forth in Section 8.14, all payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction
for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Lender at the Lender’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not
later than 12:00 noon, Mountain Standard Time or Mountain Daylight Time (as applicable), on the date specified herein. All payments received by the Lender after 12:00 noon, Mountain Standard Time or Mountain Daylight Time (as applicable), shall be
deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
(b)
Subject to the definition of “Interest Period,” if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be
reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(c) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Lender to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward costs and expenses incurred by the Lender, (ii) second, toward repayment of
interest and fees then due hereunder, and (iii) third, toward repayment of principal then due hereunder.
(d)
Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate the Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by the Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular
place or manner.
2.12 [Intentionally Omitted.]
2.13 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Lender determines in connection with any request for a Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a)Dollar deposits are not
being offered to banks in the applicable offshore Dollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b)adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate
for such Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c)the Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate for such Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of funding such Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Lender
will promptly notify the Borrower. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lender to make or maintain Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Lender revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may, without
liability for any attendant breakage costs, revoke any pending request for a Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Fixed Period Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing
of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.


24







2.14 Funding Losses. Upon demand of the Lender from time to time (which demand shall be
accompanied by a certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount demanded, the bases therefor and the calculations in respect thereto, which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error), the Borrower shall, subject
to Section 8.14, promptly compensate the Lender for and hold the Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan made to such Borrower other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary,
mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than
the failure of the Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan made to the Borrower other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c) any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to
maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
All of the Borrower’s obligations under this
Section 2.14 shall survive termination of the Commitment and payment in full of all the other Obligations.

thereafter, 5.00 to 1.00; provided, that if at the end of any such applicable four-quarter period the Borrower shall not have maintained such ratio, the Borrower will have a period of 30 days following the later of the date a Responsible
Officer has knowledge that such ratio has not been satisfied at the end of such period and 30 days following the end of such period, to cure such failure on a pro forma basis by satisfying the following clauses (i) or (ii), or any combination
of such clauses, by (1)obtaining an equity contribution which qualifies as equity under GAAP or (2)incurring Qualifying Subordinated Indebtedness in a sufficient amount that had the Borrower had such additional equity or Qualifying Subordinated
Indebtedness proceeds, or a combination of both, at or prior to the end date of such applicable four-quarter period, the Borrower would have been in compliance with this Section 6.05 for such four-quarter period and, if the Borrower
obtains such equity or such Qualifying Subordinated



33








Indebtedness proceeds, or any combination thereof, during such cure period, but in no event shall such period end later than 60 days following the end of the
corresponding ending four-quarter period, then it will be deemed to be in compliance with this Section 6.05 as of the end of such four quarter period.
6.06 Indebtedness of Non-OLP Subsidiaries. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Non-OLP Subsidiaries (other than Non-OLP Inter-Company Indebtedness) shall not exceed
an amount (the “Non-OLP Indebtedness Limitation”) equal to 0.5 times Non-OLP Pro Forma EBITDA for the four quarters then ended; provided, that to the extent that such Indebtedness of the Non-OLP Subsidiaries does exceed the
Non-OLP Indebtedness Limitation (the amount of such excess being referred to this Section 6.06 as “excess Indebtedness”) at quarter-end, the Non-OLP Subsidiaries may cure such excess Indebtedness by satisfying the following
clause (i) or clause (ii), or any combination of such clauses, within 30 days following the later of the date a Responsible Officer has knowledge of such non-compliance and 30 days following the end of such quarter (but in no event shall the
cure period extend beyond the date that is 60 days after the end of such quarter) (i)by receiving an infusion of cash or cash equivalents in an amount that (when added to all other cash and cash equivalents then being held by Non-OLP Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 6.06) equals such excess Indebtedness (or portion thereof cured pursuant to this clause (i)), which cash or cash equivalents shall be held by Non-OLP Subsidiaries until the calculation is done pursuant to this
Section 6.06 at the end of the next quarter, or (ii)by reducing the aggregate outstanding amount of Indebtedness of the Non-OLP Subsidiaries by an amount equal to such excess Indebtedness less the amount of cash or cash equivalents
infused for such quarter-end pursuant to the preceding clause (i), if any. If the Non-OLP Subsidiaries so timely cure such excess Indebtedness by making such infusion or reduction, or both as applicable, the Non-OLP Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be in compliance with this Section 6.06 as of such quarter-end date.
6.07 Indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and the
Operating Partnership Subsidiaries. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries (other than OLP Inter-Company Indebtedness) shall not exceed
an amount (the “OLP Indebtedness Limitation”) equal to 60% of the outstanding consolidated capitalization (calculated without regard to noncash adjustments to equity) of the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership
Subsidiaries as of such quarter-end date; provided, that to the extent that outstanding Indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries (other than OLP Inter-Company Indebtedness) does exceed the OLP
Indebtedness Limitation (the amount of such excess being referred to this Section 6.07 as “excess Indebtedness”) at quarter-end, the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries may cure such excess
Indebtedness by satisfying the following clause (i) or clause (ii), or any combination of such clauses, within 30 days following the later of the date a Responsible Officer has knowledge of such non-compliance and 30 days following the end of
such quarter (but in no event shall the cure period extend beyond the date that is 60 days after the end of such quarter): (i)by receiving an infusion of cash or cash equivalents in an amount that (when added to all other cash and cash equivalents
then being held by the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.07) equals such excess Indebtedness (or portion thereof cured pursuant to this clause (i)), which cash or cash equivalents
shall be held by the Operating Partnership and the



34








Operating Partnership Subsidiaries until the calculation is done pursuant to this Section 6.07 at the end of the next quarter, or (ii)by reducing
the aggregate outstanding amount of Indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries by an amount equal to such excess Indebtedness less the amount of cash or cash equivalents infused for such quarter-end pursuant
to the preceding proviso, if any. If the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership Subsidiaries so timely cure such excess Indebtedness by making such infusion or reduction, or both as applicable, the Operating Partnership and the
Operating Partnership Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be in compliance with this Section 6.07 as of such quarter-end date.
ARTICLE VII
EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
7.01 Events of Default. Any of the following shall constitute an Event of Default:
(a) Non-Payment. The Borrower fails to pay (i)when and as required to be paid herein, any amount of principal of any Loan, or
(ii)within five Business Days after the same becomes due, any interest on any Loan, or any facility, utilization or other fee due hereunder, or any other amount payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document; provided, in each case, that the
Borrower shall have received sufficient funds under the B1 Credit Agreement to make such payment; or
(b) Specific
Covenants. The Borrower shall fail to perform, observe or comply with any term, covenant or agreement contained in any of Sections 6.05, 6.06 and 6.07; or

make any payment when due (whether by scheduled maturity, required prepayment, acceleration, demand, or otherwise), inclusive of any grace, extension, forbearance or similar period, in respect of any Indebtedness having an aggregate principal amount
(including undrawn or available amounts and including amounts owing to all creditors under any combined or syndicated credit arrangement) of more than the Threshold Amount, or (B)fails to observe or perform any other agreement or condition relating
to any such Indebtedness or contained in any instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or relating thereto, or any other event occurs, for a period beyond the applicable grace, cure, extension, forbearance or other similar period the effect of
which default or other event is to cause, or to permit the holder or holders of such Indebtedness (or the beneficiary or beneficiaries of any applicable Guarantee Obligation (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such holder or holders or beneficiary
or beneficiaries) to cause, with the giving of notice if required, such Indebtedness to be demanded or to become due or to be repurchased or redeemed (automatically or otherwise) prior to its stated maturity, or such Guarantee Obligation to become
payable or cash collateral in respect thereof to be demanded; or (ii)there occurs under any Swap Contract an Early Termination Date (as defined in such Swap Contract) resulting from (A)any event of default under such Swap Contract as to which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary other than, for the avoidance of doubt, an Unrestricted Subsidiary is the Defaulting Party (as defined in such Swap Contract) or (B)any Termination Event (as so defined) under such Swap Contract as to which the Borrower or
any Subsidiary other than, for the avoidance of doubt, an Unrestricted Subsidiary is



35








an Affected Party (as so defined) and, in either event, the Swap Termination Value owed by the Borrower or such Subsidiary other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a result thereof is greater than the Threshold Amount; or
(d) Insolvency
Proceedings, Etc. The Borrower or any Material Subsidiary institutes or consents to the institution of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or applies for or consents to the appointment
of any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator or similar officer for it or for all or any material part of its property; or any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator or similar officer is
appointed without the application or consent of such Person and the appointment continues undischarged or unstayed for 60 calendar days; or any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any such Person or to all or any part of its property
is instituted without the consent of such Person and continues undismissed or unstayed for 60 calendar days, or an order for relief is entered in any such proceeding.
7.02 Remedies Upon Event of Default. If any Event of Default occurs and is then continuing, the Lender may:
(a) declare the Commitment of the Lender to make Loans to be terminated, whereupon such commitment and obligation shall be terminated;
(b) declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or
payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower; and
(c) exercise on behalf of itself all rights and remedies available to it under the Loan Documents or applicable law to enforce its rights
to the proceeds of any repayment by Series AC under the B1 Credit Agreement;
provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any event
specified in subsection (d) of Section 7.01 with respect to the Borrower, the obligation of the Lender to make Loans shall automatically terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest and other
amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, in each case without further act of the Lender; provided further, that the sole recourse for the Lender’s repayment of any and all Obligations under this Agreement shall be
the repayment proceeds received by the Borrower pursuant to the B1 Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Borrower be liable to the Lender for any amounts due under this
Agreement in excess of the amounts received by the Borrower pursuant to the B1 Credit Agreement, nor shall Borrower be obligated to make any payment due under this Agreement at any time that Borrower shall not have received sufficient funds pursuant
to the B1 Credit Agreement to make such payment at such time.
ARTICLE VIII
MISCELLANEOUS
8.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by the Lender and the Borrower, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.


36







8.02 Notices and Other Communications; Facsimile Copies.
(a) Notices Generally. Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and
except as provided in subsection (b) below), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopier
as follows, and all notices and other communications expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made to the applicable telephone number, as follows: if to the Borrower or the Lender, to the address, telecopier number, electronic
mail address or telephone number specified for such Person on Schedule 8.02;
Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by
certified or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices sent by telecopier shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to
have been given at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient). Notices delivered through electronic communications to the extent provided in subsection (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such subsection (b).

(b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lender may be delivered or furnished by
electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites), provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to the Lender if such Lender has notified the Borrower that it is incapable of receiving notices by
electronic communication.
Unless the Lender otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received
upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or
other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or
communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication
is available and identifying the website address therefor.
(c) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrower and the
Lender may change its address, telecopier, e-mail address or telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other party hereto.
(d) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Signature pages to Loan Documents may be delivered by facsimile
transmission or electronic mail. The effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on the Borrower and the



37








Lender. The Lender may also require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original thereof; provided,
however, that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by facsimile transmission or electronic mail.
8.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by the Lender to exercise, and no delay by such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein or therein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.
8.04 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that the Borrower makes a payment to the Lender and such payment or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been
made.
8.05 Successors and Assigns.
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except
that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lender. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b) Assignments by Lender. The Lender may at any time assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it). The party to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Lender an Assignment and Assumption Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C. No such assignment shall be
made to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries. No such assignment shall be made to a natural person. From and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and have
the rights and obligations of the Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement and shall cease to be a party hereto, but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.14 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver new or replacement Notes to the assignee Lender, and if the
assigning Lender holds a Note, it shall, contemporaneous with the Borrower’s delivery of a new or replacement Note, deliver such Note to the Borrower, marked “Cancelled”.


38







8.06 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum amount, or be computed at a rate that exceeds the maximum rate, of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum
Rate”). If the Lender shall contract for, charge, receive, reserve or take interest in an amount or at a rate that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid
principal, refunded to the Borrower, and in no event shall the Borrower or any other Person ever be liable for unearned interest or ever be required to pay interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. In determining whether the interest contracted for,
charged, received, reserved or taken by the Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest,
(b)exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations. If the Laws of the State of Texas
are applicable for purposes of determining the “Maximum Rate”, then that term means the “indicated rate ceiling” from time to time in effect under Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code. The Borrower agrees that Chapter 346 of the
Texas Finance Code does not apply to any Borrowing.
8.07 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
8.08 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Lender in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint
participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.
8.09 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

8.10 Governing Law.
(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE; PROVIDED THAT THE LENDER
SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.


39







(b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN MANHATTAN OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF SUCH STATE, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER EACH CONSENTS, FOR
ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER EACH IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON
CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT RELATED THERETO.
8.11 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO IN
EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER FOUNDED IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE SIGNATORIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.
8.12 USA PATRIOT Act Notice. The Lender hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”), it may be required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other
information that will allow the Lender, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.
8.13 ENTIRE
AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO
UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
8.14 Limited Recourse. Neither any director, officer or employee of the
Borrower or any of its Affiliates nor any partner thereof, shall have any liability for any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligation or its creation. It is
acknowledged by the parties hereto that (a) the sole source of payment on the Obligations shall be the proceeds of the payments received by the Borrower under the B1 Credit Agreement and (b) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or
any other Loan Document to the contrary, Borrower shall only be liable to Lender for the Obligations to the extent Borrower has received funds under the B1 Credit Agreement to satisfy such Obligations.

Section 7.1(a):
(a) the Subordinated Creditor shall promptly file a claim or claims, in the form required in
such proceedings, for the full outstanding amount of the Subordinated Indebtedness, and shall cause said claim or claims to be approved and all payments and other distributions in respect thereof to be made directly to the Beneficiaries, ratably

Proceeding with respect to any and all claims of the Subordinated Creditor relating to the Subordinated Indebtedness;
Exhibit D to

A1 Credit Agreement

Creditor shall not, unless otherwise agreed by the Beneficiaries, (i) file any motion, application or other pleading seeking affirmative relief, including without limitation for the appointment of a trustee or examiner, for the conversion of
the case to a liquidation proceeding, for the substantive consolidation of the Obligor’s bankruptcy case with the case of any other entity, for the creation of a separate official committee representing only the Subordinated Creditor or any
other form of affirmative relief of any other kind or nature, or (ii) file any objection or other responsive pleading opposing any relief requested by any Beneficiary; and

assignments of claim and other instruments confirming the authorization referred to in the foregoing clause (b), and any powers of attorney confirming the rights of the Beneficiaries arising hereunder, and shall take such other actions as may be
requested by the Beneficiaries or their representative in order to enable the Beneficiaries or their representative to enforce any and all claims in respect of the Subordinated Indebtedness.

cash, securities, or other property) or any security shall be received by the Subordinated Creditor in contravention of the terms of this Agreement, such payment, distribution or security shall not be commingled with any asset of the Subordinated
Creditor, shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered or transferred to, the Beneficiaries, or their representative, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of the Beneficiary
Indebtedness held by each of them, for application to the payment of all Beneficiary Indebtedness then remaining unpaid, until all such Beneficiary Indebtedness shall have been paid in full.

modified, or supplemented, the “Subordination Agreement”), by the maker and payee of this instrument in favor of the “Lender” referred to therein, to all Senior Indebtedness as defined therein), and each holder of this
instrument, by its acceptance hereof, shall be bound by the Subordination Agreement.”

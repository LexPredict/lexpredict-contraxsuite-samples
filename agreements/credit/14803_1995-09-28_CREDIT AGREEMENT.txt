made to such Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

net operating income with respect thereto as of such date.  Each June 30
Reserve Report shall be prepared by the Borrower and each December 31 Reserve
Report shall be prepared by the Independent Engineer.  Each June 30 Reserve
Report may be prepared in summary form and shall include a review of any
material production variances, if any, from the immediately preceding December
31 Reserve Report.

(ii)  At any date the Borrower may at its expense furnish
additional Reserve Reports to the Agent and the Co-Agent ("Optional Reserve
Reports"), which Optional Reserve Reports need not be prepared or audited by an
independent petroleum engineer (unless the Agent or the Co-Agent so requests),
each dated a date other than June 30 or December 31.

(iii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.6(b)(i),
upon the Borrower's written request, and upon submission of an Optional Reserve
Report, the Agent and the Co-Agent shall review the Borrowing Base and make any
adjustments thereto they deem appropriate under the circumstances, provided
that in no event shall the Agent and the Co-Agent be required to make more
than two such unscheduled Borrowing Base determinations during any calendar
year.

(iv)  Within forty-five days after they both receive each
Reserve Report or Optional Reserve Report, the Agent and the Co-Agent shall
make a determination of the Borrowing Base, and shall notify the Borrower of
the new Borrowing Base, if any.

(v)   Within forty-five days after the Borrower has
notified the Agent and the Co-Agent pursuant to subsection 2.7(c) that it has
determined to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the Borrowing Base Assets
(other than sales permitted by subsections 6.6(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f)), the
Agent and the Co-Agent shall make a redetermination of the Borrowing Base, and
shall notify the Borrower of the new Borrowing Base, if any.

(vi)  The Borrower agrees to pay or reimburse the Agent and
the Co-Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with (a) the examination of each Optional Reserve Report furnished
to the Agent and the Co-Agent by the Borrower, (b) the determination of the
Borrowing Base pursuant to such Reserve Report or Optional Reserve Report, (c)
the redetermination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to subsection 2.6(b)(v) and
(d) the notification of the Borrower of such Borrowing Base.

(vii)  Each determination of the Borrowing Base shall be
made by the Agent and the Co-Agent in the exercise of their sole discretion in
accordance with the then current standards and practices of the Agent and the
Co-Agent for similar oil and gas loans, taking into account such factors as
the Agent and the Co-Agent may deem appropriate, including, without limitation
the nature and extent of the Borrower's interest in the Borrowing Base Assets
and the anticipated timing and extent of net operating income therefrom;
provided that each such determination shall be approved by the Required
Lenders.  The Agent and the Co-Agent may in their sole discretion discount the
value of any Borrowing Base Asset set forth in a Reserve Report or an Optional
Reserve Report by the same factors utilized by it in discounting the value of
comparable borrowing base assets in comparable transactions.

(viii)   Each delivery by the Borrower to the Agent and the
Co-Agent of a Reserve Report or an Optional Reserve Report shall be deemed to
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower to the Agent and the
Co-Agent that the Borrower, to the extent of the interest specified in such
report (and subject to exceptions disclosed in writing to the Agent and the
Co-Agent by the Borrower), has good and marketable title to the Borrowing Base
Assets and any other property rights or interests described in such report, and
that none of such Borrowing Base Assets or other property rights or interests
is subject to any Lien other than as permitted by subsection 6.3.

2.7  Optional and Mandatory Prepayments.  (a)  The Borrower
may at any time and from time to time prepay the Revolving Credit Loans, in
whole or in part,






<PAGE>   22
16

without premium or penalty (subject to subsection 2.17), upon at least four
Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Agent, specifying the date and amount
of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans or a
combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to
each.  Upon receipt of any such notice the Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender thereof.  If any such notice is given, the amount specified in such
notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with
any amounts payable pursuant to subsection 2.17.  Partial prepayments shall be
in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof.

(b)  In the event the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the
Revolving Credit Loans shall at any time be in excess of the Borrowing Base at
such time, the Agent shall so notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall,
within 30 days after such notification, either (i) prepay the principal of the
Revolving Credit Loans, in an aggregate amount at least equal to such excess,
together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of such
prepayment or (ii) take such actions as may be approved by the Agent and the
Co-Agent in their sole discretion to increase the Borrowing Base by the amount
of such excess in a manner satisfactory to the Agent and the Co-Agent.

(c)  In the event the Borrower determines to sell or otherwise
dispose of any of the Borrowing Base Assets (other than sales permitted by
subsections 6.6 (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f)), the Borrower shall immediately
notify the Agent and the Co-Agent (but in no event later than five Business
Days prior to the date of such sale or disposition) and, no later than three
Business Days following the consummation of such sale or disposition, the
Borrower shall prepay the Revolving Credit Loans in an aggregate amount equal
to the net proceeds of such sale or disposition; provided that no later than
three Business Days following the redetermination of the Borrowing Base by the
Agent and the Co-Agent to reflect such sale or disposition, the Borrower shall
additionally prepay the Revolving Credit Loans in an aggregate amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Revolving Credit Loans after reflecting payment of the net proceeds of such
asset sale or disposition over (ii) the Borrowing Base as redetermined by the
Agent and the Co-Agent to reflect such sale or disposition.

(d)  In the event that both ABR Loans and Eurodollar Loans are
outstanding on the date of any such mandatory prepayment made in accordance
with the terms of paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section 2.7, the Borrower shall
apply such mandatory prepayment first to prepay any or all of such outstanding
ABR Loans and next to prepay any or all of such outstanding Eurodollar Loans,
provided that in the event the Borrower shall apply such mandatory prepayment
to prepay a Eurodollar Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period with respect thereto, any losses or costs incurred by the Lenders shall
be indemnified by the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.17.

2.8  Conversion and Continuation Options. (a)  The Borrower
may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans by giving
the Agent at least two Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such
election, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be
made on the last day of an Interest Period






<PAGE>   23
17

with respect thereto.  The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR
Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Agent at least three Business Days'
prior irrevocable notice of such election.  Any such notice of conversion to
Eurodollar Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period or
Interest Periods therefor.  Upon receipt of any such notice the Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender thereof.  All or any part of outstanding Eurodollar
Loans and ABR Loans may be converted as provided herein, provided that (i) no
Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent has or the Required
Lenders have determined that such a conversion is not appropriate and (ii) no
Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan after the date
that is one month prior to the Termination Date.

(b)  Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the
expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the
Borrower giving notice to the Agent, in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in subsection 1.1, of the
length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Revolving Credit
Loans, provided that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such (i) when any
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent has or the
Required Lenders have determined that such a continuation is not appropriate or
(ii) after the date that is one month prior to the Termination Date and
provided, further, that if the Borrower shall fail to give such notice or if
such continuation is not permitted such Revolving Credit Loans shall be
automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring
Interest Period.

2.9  Minimum Amounts and Maximum Number of Tranches.  All
borrowings, conversions and continuations of Revolving Credit Loans hereunder
and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and
be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the
aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans comprising each
Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000
in excess thereof.  In no event shall there be more than eight Eurodollar
Tranches outstanding at any time.

2.10  Interest Rates and Payment Dates.  (a)  Each Eurodollar
Loan shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect
thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such
day plus the Applicable Margin.

(b)  Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the ABR.

(c)  If all or a portion of (i) any principal of any Revolving
Credit Loan, (ii) any interest payable thereon, (iii) any commitment fee or
(iv) any other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at
the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), the principal of the
Revolving Credit Loans and any such overdue interest, commitment fee or other
amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is (x) in the case of
principal, the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this subsection plus 2% or (y) in the case of any such
overdue interest, commitment fee or other amount, the rate described in






<PAGE>   24
18

paragraph (b) of this subsection plus 2%, in each case from the date of such
non-payment until such overdue principal, interest, commitment fee or other
amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment).

(d)  Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
subsection shall be payable from time to time on demand.

2.11  Computation of Interest and Fees.  (a) Commitment fees
and, whenever it is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, interest shall
be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for
the actual days elapsed; and, otherwise, interest shall be calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed.  The Agent shall as soon
as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a
Eurodollar Rate.  Any change in the interest rate on a Revolving Credit Loan
resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements
shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such
change becomes effective.  The Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such
change in interest rate.

(b)  Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on
the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error.  The Agent
shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement
showing the quotations used by the Agent in determining any interest rate
pursuant to subsection 2.10(a).

2.12  Inability to Determine Interest Rate.  If prior to the
first day of any Interest Period:

(a)  the Agent shall have determined (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period, or

(b)  the Agent shall have received notice from the Majority
Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate to be determined for such Interest
Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders
(as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining
their affected Revolving Credit Loans during such Interest Period,

the Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and
the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.  If such notice is given (x) any
Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period
shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Revolving Credit Loans that were to have
been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans
shall be converted to or continued as ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding
Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period,
to ABR Loans.  Until such notice has been withdrawn by the






<PAGE>   25
19

Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor
shall the Borrower have the right to convert Revolving Credit Loans to
Eurodollar Loans.

2.13  Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.  (a)  Each borrowing by
the Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on
account of any commitment fee hereunder and any reduction of the Commitments of
the Lenders shall be made pro rata according to the respective Commitment
Percentages of the Lenders.  Each payment (including each prepayment) by the
Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Credit Loans
shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal
amounts of the Revolving Credit Loans then held by the Lenders.  All payments
(including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on
account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set
off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time,
on the due date thereof to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the
Agent's office specified in subsection 9.2, in Dollars and in immediately
available funds.  The Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders
promptly upon receipt in like funds as received.  If any payment hereunder
becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments
of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate
during such extension.

(b)  Unless the Agent shall have been notified in writing by
any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that
would constitute its Commitment Percentage of such borrowing available to the
Agent, the Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to
the Agent, and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available
to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  If such amount is not made available
to the Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender
shall pay to the Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate
equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until
such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Agent.  A
certificate of the Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts
owing under this subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.  If such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such borrowing is not made
available to the Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such
Borrowing Date, the Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with
interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder, on
demand, from the Borrower.

2.14  Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein,
if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the
interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to
make or maintain Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the
commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue
Eurodollar Loans as such and convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall
forthwith be cancelled and (b) such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans then
outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to
ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with
respect to such Revolving Credit Loans or within such earlier period as
required by law.  If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day
which is not the last day of the






<PAGE>   26
20

then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to subsection
2.17.

2.15  Requirements of Law.  (a)  If the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application
thereof or compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

(i)   shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind
whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Note or any Eurodollar
Loan, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in
respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by subsection
2.16 and changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such
Lender);

(ii)  shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement
against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the
account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any
other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender which is not
otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or

(iii)   shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting
into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any amount
receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower
shall promptly pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.

(b)  If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of
or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such
Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's
policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender
to be material, then from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such reduction.

(c)  If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional
amounts pursuant to this subsection, it shall promptly notify the Borrower
(with a copy to the Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so
entitled.  A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
subsection submitted by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent)
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.






<PAGE>   27
21

The agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

2.16  Taxes.  (a)  All payments made by the Borrower under
this Agreement and any Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income,
stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes
(imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Agent or any Lender as a
result of a present or former connection between the Agent or such Lender and
the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any
such connection arising solely from the Agent or such Lender having executed,
delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or
enforced, this Agreement or any Note).  If any such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded
Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Agent or
any Lender hereunder or under any Note, the amounts so payable to the Agent or
such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Agent or
such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such
other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in
this Agreement, provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to
increase any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the
laws of the United States of America or a state thereof if such Lender fails to
comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this subsection.  Whenever any
Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible
thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Agent for its own account or for the
account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original
official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof.  If the
Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Agent the required receipts or other
required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and the
Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become
payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.  The
agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

(b)  Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of
the United States of America or a state thereof shall:

(i)   deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (A) two duly
completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
or 4224, or successor applicable form, as the case may be, and (B) an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable
form, as the case may be;

(ii)  deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two further
copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that
any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after
the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form
previously delivered by it to the Borrower; and






<PAGE>   28
22

(iii)   obtain such extensions of time for filing and
complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested
by the Borrower or the Agent;

unless in any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in
treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such
delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable
or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such
form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the Agent.
Such Lender shall certify (i) in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224, that it is
entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (ii) in the case of a
Form W-8 or W-9, that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax.  Each Person that shall become a Lender or a Participant
pursuant to subsection 9.6 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related
transfer, be required to provide all of the forms and statements required
pursuant to this subsection, provided that in the case of a Participant such
Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender
from which the related participation shall have been purchased.

2.17  Indemnity.  The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender
and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may
sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a
borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the
Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any
prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar
Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect
thereto.  Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so
prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the
date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to
the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date
of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such
Revolving Credit Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable
Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as
reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Bank on
such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with
leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.  This covenant shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans
and all other amounts payable hereunder.

2.18  Change of Lending Office.  Each Lender agrees that if it
makes any demand for payment under subsection 2.15 or 2.16(a), or if any
adoption or change of the type described in subsection 2.14 shall occur with
respect to it, it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions and so long as such efforts would
not be disadvantageous to it, as determined in its sole discretion) to
designate a different lending office if the making of such a designation would
reduce or obviate the need for the Borrower to make payments under subsection






<PAGE>   29
23

2.15 or 2.16(a), or would eliminate or reduce the effect of any adoption or
change described in subsection 2.14.


SECTION 3.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

To induce the Agent and the Lenders to enter into this
Agreement and to make the Revolving Credit Loans, the Borrower hereby
represents and warrants to the Agent and each Lender that:

3.1  Financial Condition.  The consolidated balance sheet of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 1994 and the
related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal year
ended on such date, reported on by Arthur Andersen LLP, copies of which have
heretofore been furnished to each Lender, are complete and correct and present
fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal year then
ended.  The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at June 30, 1995 and the related unaudited
consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the six-month period
ended on such date, certified by a Responsible Officer, copies of which have
heretofore been furnished to each Lender, are complete and correct and present
fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the six-month period
then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments).  All such financial
statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods
involved (except as approved by such accountants or Responsible Officer, as the
case may be, and as disclosed therein).  Neither the Borrower nor any of its
consolidated Subsidiaries had, at the date of the most recent balance sheet
referred to above, any material Guarantee Obligation, contingent liability or
liability for taxes, or any long-term lease or unusual forward or long-term
commitment, including, without limitation, any interest rate or foreign
currency swap or exchange transaction, which is not reflected in the foregoing
statements or in the notes thereto.  During the period from June 30, 1995 to
and including the date hereof there has been no sale, transfer or other
disposition by the Borrower or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries of any
material part of its business or property and no purchase or other acquisition
of any business or property (including any capital stock of any other Person)
material in relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower
and its consolidated Subsidiaries at June 30, 1995.

3.2  No Change.  (a) Since June 30, 1995 there has been no
development or event which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (b) during the period from June 30, 1995 to and
including the date hereof no dividends or other distributions have been
declared, paid or made upon the Capital Stock of the Borrower nor has any of
the Capital Stock of the Borrower been redeemed, retired, purchased or
otherwise acquired for value by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.






<PAGE>   30
24

3.3  Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law.  Each of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has
the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its
property (including, without limitation, the Borrowing Base Assets), to lease
the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is
currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to
the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

3.4  Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.
The Borrower has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to
make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to
borrow hereunder and has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the
borrowings on the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any Notes and to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to
which it is a party.  No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or
other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person
is required in connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution,
delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents to
which the Borrower is a party.  This Agreement has been, and each other Loan
Document to which it is a party will be, duly executed and delivered on behalf
of the Borrower.  This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document to
which it is a party when executed and delivered will constitute, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

3.5  No Legal Bar.  The execution, delivery and performance of
the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party, the borrowings hereunder
and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law or
Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or of any of its Subsidiaries and will
not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of its
or their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of
Law or Contractual Obligation.

3.6  No Material Litigation.  No litigation, investigation or

revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan Documents or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) which could reasonably be

occurred and is continuing.

3.8  Ownership of Property; Liens.  Each of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries has good record and marketable title in fee simple to, or a
valid leasehold interest in, all its real property (including, without
limitation, the Borrowing Base Assets), and good title to, or a valid leasehold
interest in, all its other property, and none of such property is subject to
any Lien except as permitted by subsection 6.3.

3.9  Intellectual Property.  The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames,
copyrights, technology, know-how and processes necessary for the conduct of its
business as currently conducted except for those the failure to own or license

"Intellectual Property").  No claim has been asserted and is pending by any
Person challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual Property or
the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property, nor does the
Borrower know of any valid basis for any such claim.  The use of such
Intellectual Property by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on
the rights of any Person, except for such claims and infringements that, in the

property and all other taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its

of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided
on the books of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be); no tax
Lien has been filed, and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, no claim is being
asserted, with respect to any such tax, fee or other charge.

3.12  Federal Regulations.  No part of the proceeds of any
Revolving Credit Loans will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin
stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under
Regulation G or Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.  If requested by any
Lender or the Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Agent and each Lender a

the case may be.

<PAGE>   32
26

made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code.  No
termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the
PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period.  The present value of
all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those
assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation
date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made,
exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits.
Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or
partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, and neither the Borrower nor
any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any liability under
ERISA if the Borrower or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw
completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely
preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made.  No
such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.

Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended or (b) a "holding company" as
defined in, or otherwise subject to regulation under, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935.  The Borrower is not subject to regulation under
any Federal or State statute or regulation (other than Regulation X of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) which limits its ability to
incur Indebtedness.

3.15  Purpose of Revolving Credit Loans.  The proceeds of the
Revolving Credit Loans shall be used by the Borrower to refinance the Demand
Loan and for general corporate purposes in the ordinary course of business.

3.16  Environmental Matters.  Except for environmental matters
which in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to either (a) result
in the existence of an unsatisfied liability in excess of a Material
Environmental Amount or (b) have a Material Adverse Effect:

(a)  To the best of the Borrower's knowledge, the facilities
and properties owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Properties") do not contain, and have not
previously contained, any Materials of Environmental Concern in

Subsidiaries (the Business").






<PAGE>   33

(c)  Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice of violation, alleged violation, non-compliance,
liability or potential liability regarding environmental matters or
compliance with Environmental Laws with regard to any of the
Properties or the Business, nor does the Borrower have knowledge or
reason to believe that any such notice will be received or is being
threatened.

(d)  To the best of the Borrower's knowledge, materials of
Environmental Concern have not been transported or disposed of from
the Properties in violation of, or in a manner or to a location which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to liability under, any
Environmental Law, nor have any Materials of Environmental Concern
been generated, treated, stored or disposed of at, on or under any of
the Properties in violation of, or in a manner that could give rise to
liability under, any applicable Environmental Law.

(e)  No judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative
action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened,
under any Environmental Law to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary is
or will be named as a party with respect to the Properties or the
Business, nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees, consent
orders, administrative orders or other orders, or other administrative
or judicial requirements outstanding under any Environmental Law with
respect to the Properties or the Business.

(f)  To the best of the Borrower's knowledge, there has been
no release or threat of release of Materials of Environmental Concern
at or from the Properties, or arising from or related to the
operations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with the
Properties or otherwise in connection with the Business, in violation
of or in amounts or in a manner that could give rise to liability
under Environmental Laws.

3.17  Insurance.  The Borrower maintains with financially
sound and reputable insurance companies insurance in at least such amounts and
against at least such risks (but including in any event public liability) as
are usually insured against in the same general area by companies engaged in
the same or a similar business and such insurance is otherwise in compliance
with the Loan Documents.

SECTION 8.  THE AGENT

8.1  Appointment.  Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates
and appoints the Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Agent, in
such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform
such duties as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan






<PAGE>   48
42

Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except
those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against the Agent.

8.2  Delegation of Duties.  The Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents
or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties.  The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care.

8.3  Exculpatory Provisions.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall
be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or
such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful
misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower or any
officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in
any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided
for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
for any failure of the Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder.  The Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower.

8.4  Reliance by Agent.  The Agent shall be entitled to rely,
and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to
be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper
Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including,
without limitation, counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Agent.  The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any
Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of
assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Agent.  The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first
receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the
Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders
of the Revolving Credit Loans.






<PAGE>   49
43


8.5  Notice of Default.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default".  In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice, the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.
The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided that
unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem
advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

8.6  Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Agent hereinafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by the Agent to any Lender.  Each
Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into
the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and made its own decision to make its
Revolving Credit Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent
or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems
necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower.  Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders
by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the
business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects
or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the possession of the
Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact
or Affiliates.

8.7  Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and
without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to
their respective Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on which
indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon
which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Revolving Credit Loans
shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Commitment
Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any
time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the
Revolving Credit Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this
Agreement, any of the other






<PAGE>   50
44

Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or
therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken
or omitted by the Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.  The agreements in this subsection shall
survive the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

8.8  Agent in Its Individual Capacity.  The Agent and its
Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any
kind of business with the Borrower as though the Agent were not the Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  With respect to the Revolving
Credit Loans made by it, the Agent shall have the same rights and powers under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"
shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.

8.9  Successor Agent.  The Agent may resign as Agent upon 10
days' notice to the Lenders.  If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint
from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent
shall be approved by the Borrower, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed
to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean
such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the
former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without
any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the
parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Revolving Credit Loans.  After
any retiring Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Section 8
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken  or omitted to be taken by
it while it was Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

8.10  Co-Agent.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Co-Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Co-Agent.


SECTION 9.  MISCELLANEOUS

9.1  Amendments and Waivers.  Neither this Agreement nor any
other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended,
supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this
subsection. The Required Lenders may, or, with the written consent of the
Required Lenders, the Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the

supplement or modification shall (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled
date of maturity of any Revolving Credit Loan or of any installment thereof, or

scheduled date of any payment thereof or increase the amount or extend the
expiration date of any Lender's Commitment, in each case without the consent of
each Lender affected thereby, or (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of
this subsection or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of

Lenders, or (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 8 without the
written consent of the then Agent.  Any such waiver and any such amendment,
supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall
be binding upon the Borrower, the Lenders, the Agent and all future holders of
the Revolving Credit Loans.  In the case of any waiver, the Borrower, the
Lenders and the Agent shall be restored to their former positions and rights
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of
Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; no such waiver
shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any such
Lender, as the case may be, or (ii) legal proceedings commenced against the
Agent or any such Lender by any security holder or creditor thereof arising out
of and based upon rights afforded any such security holder or creditor solely
in its capacity as such.  The agreements in this subsection shall survive
repayment of the Revolving Credit Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

9.6  Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.
(a)  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, the Lenders, the Agent and their respective successors and assigns,
except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
Lender.

(b)  Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one
or more banks or other entities approved by the Borrower, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld ("Participants") participating interests in any
Revolving Credit Loan owing to such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or
any other interest of such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.
In the event of any such sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a
Participant, such Lender's obligations under this Agreement to the other
parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain
solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the
holder of any such Revolving Credit Loan for all purposes under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  The
Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due or
unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have the right of setoff in
respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to
the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing
directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement, provided that, in purchasing
such participating interest, such Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to
share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof as provided in subsection 9.7(a) as
fully as if it were a Lender hereunder.  The Borrower also agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.15, 2.16 and
2.17 with respect to its participation in the Commitments and the Revolving
Credit Loans outstanding from time to time as if it was a Lender; provided
that, in the case of subsection 2.16, such Participant shall have complied with
the requirements of said subsection and provided, further, that no Participant
shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to any such subsection
than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in






<PAGE>   54
48

respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor
Lender to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.

(c)  Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial
banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time and from
time to time assign to any Lender or any affiliate thereof or, with the consent
of the Borrower and the Agent (which in each case shall not be unreasonably
withheld), to an additional bank or financial institution ("an Assignee") all
or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the
form of Exhibit F, executed by such Assignee, such assigning Lender (and, in
the case of an Assignee that is not then a Lender or an affiliate thereof, by
the Borrower and the Agent) and delivered to the Agent for its acceptance and
recording in the Register.  Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein,
and (y) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the
remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such assigning Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

(d)  The Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall maintain at
the address of the Agent referred to in subsection 9.2 a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment
of, and principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans owing to, each Lender
from time to time.  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the
absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may
(and, in the case of any Revolving Credit Loan or other obligation hereunder
not evidenced by a Note, shall) treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Register as the owner of a Revolving Credit Loan or other obligation hereunder
as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  Any assignment of any
Revolving Credit Loan or other obligation hereunder not evidenced by a Note
shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being
made in the Register.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon
reasonable prior notice.

(e)  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and an Assignee (and, in the case of an Assignee that is
not then a Lender or an affiliate thereof, by the Borrower and the Agent),
together with payment by the Assignee to the Agent of a registration and
processing fee of $2500, the Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment
and Acceptance and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto
record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of
such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

(f)  The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any
Participant or Assignee (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee
any and all financial






<PAGE>   55
49

information in such Lender's possession concerning the Borrower and its
Affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender
by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with such Lender's credit
evaluation of the Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this
Agreement.

(g)  For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement
acknowledge that the provisions of this subsection concerning assignments of
Revolving Credit Loans and Notes relate only to absolute assignments and that
such provisions do not prohibit assignments creating security interests,
including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment by a Lender of any
Revolving Credit Loan or Note to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
applicable law.

9.7  Adjustments; Set-off.  (a)  If any Lender (a "benefitted
Lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Revolving
Credit Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof
(whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or
proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 7(f), or otherwise), in a
greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other
Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon,
such benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a
participating interest in such portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or
shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or
the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Lender to
share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably
with each of the Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such
excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Lender,
such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned,
to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

(b)  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the
Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent
permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the
Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any
currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in
each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or
unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency
thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower.  Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

9.8  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by one or
more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts
(including by facsimile transmission), and all of said counterparts taken
together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.  A copy of
this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and
the Agent.






<PAGE>   56

9.9  Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

9.10  Integration.  This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents represent the agreement of the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by the Agent or any Lender relative
to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in
the other Loan Documents.

9.11  GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

9.12  Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers.  The Borrower
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a)  submits for itself and its property in any legal action
or proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgement in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of New York, the courts of the
United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and
appellate courts from any thereof;

(b)  consents that any such action or proceeding may be
brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any
such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an
inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

(c)  agrees that service of process in any such action or
proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
prepaid, to the Borrower at its address set forth in subsection 9.2 or
at such other address of which the Agent shall have been notified
pursuant thereto;

(d)  agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to
effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or
shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

(e)  waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any
right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or
proceeding referred to in this subsection any special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages.

9.13  Acknowledgements.  The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:






<PAGE>   57
51

(a)  it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

(b)  neither the Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary
relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and
the relationship between Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and the
Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or therewith is
solely that of debtor and creditor; and

(c)  no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan
Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions
contemplated hereby among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the
Lenders.

9.14  WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL.  THE BORROWER, THE AGENT AND THE
LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND
FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

9.15  Limitation of Interest.  (a)  It is the intent of the
Borrower and the Lenders in the execution and performance of this Agreement and
all matters incidental and related hereto and the other Loan Documents or any
agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith or therewith or with
any Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lenders to remain in strict compliance
with all laws applicable to the Lenders from time to time in effect, including,
without limitation, usury laws.  In furtherance hereof, the Borrower and the
Lenders stipulate and agree that none of the terms and provisions contained in
or pertaining to this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents or any other
agreement or instrument ("Other Agreement") executed in connection herewith or
with any Indebtedness of the Borrower to the Lenders shall ever be construed to
create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money with
interest at a rate or in an amount in excess of the maximum amount of interest
permitted to be charged by the Lenders under all laws in effect and applicable
to the Lenders (the "Maximum Rate").  For purposes of this Agreement and the
Revolving Credit Notes, "interest" shall include the aggregate of all amounts
which constitute or are deemed to constitute interest under the respective laws
in effect and applicable to the Lenders that are contracted for, chargeable,
receivable (whether received or deemed to have been received) or taken under
this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Notes or any Other Agreement.  The
Borrower shall not be required to pay interest hereunder or on any Revolving
Credit Note or any Other Agreement at a rate or in an amount in excess of the
Maximum Rate with respect to the Lenders or the maximum amount of interest that
may be lawfully charged by the Lenders under any law which is in effect and
applicable to the Lenders, and the provisions of this subsection 9.15 shall
control over all other provisions of this Agreement and the Revolving Credit
Notes or any Other Agreement which may be in apparent conflict herewith.  If
the effective rate or amount of interest which would otherwise be payable under
this Agreement or any Revolving Credit Note or any Other Agreement, or all of
them, would exceed the Maximum Rate for the Lenders or the maximum amount of
interest the Lenders or any holder of any Revolving Credit Note or any Other
Agreement is allowed by the relevant applicable law






<PAGE>   58
52

to charge, contract for, take or receive or in the event the Lenders or any
holder of any Revolving Credit Note or any Other Agreement shall charge,
contract for, take or receive monies that are deemed to constitute interest
which could, in the absence of this provision, increase the effective rate or
amount of interest payable under this Agreement or any Revolving Credit Note or
any Other Agreement, or all of them, to a rate or amount in excess of that
permitted to be charged, contracted for, taken or received under the applicable
laws then in effect with respect to the Lenders, then the principal amount of
the Revolving Credit Notes or the obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders
under this Agreement, the Revolving Credit Notes or any Other Agreement or the
amount of interest which would otherwise be payable to or for the account of
the Lenders under this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Notes or any Other
Agreement or all of them, shall be reduced to the amount allowed under said
laws as now or hereafter construed by the courts having jurisdiction, and all
such monies so charged, contracted for, or received that are deemed to
constitute interest in excess of the Maximum Rate for the Lenders or maximum
amount of interest permitted by the relevant applicable laws shall be
immediately returned to or credited to the account of the Company upon such
determination.  In determining whether the interest paid or payable under any
specific contingency exceed the Maximum Rate, the Borrower and the Lenders
shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (i) characterize any
non-principal payment as an expense, fee (excluding attorneys' and accountants'
fees) or premium rather than interest and (ii) amortize, prorate, allocate and
spread, in equal parts during the full term of the relevant Revolving Credit
Note, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received in
connection with the relevant Revolving Credit Note.

(b)  To the extent the Lenders' Maximum Rate is at any time
determined by the laws of the State of Texas (i) such rate shall be the
"indicated rate ceiling" described in Section (a)(1) of Article 5069-1.04 of
Chapter 1, Subtitle 1, Title 79, of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925,
as amended; provided, however, to the extent permitted by such Article, the
Lenders by notice to the Borrower may revise the aforesaid election of such
interest rate ceiling as such ceiling affects the then current or future
balances outstanding under the Revolving Credit Notes and other Loan Documents
and Other Agreements and (ii) Chapter 15, Subtitle 3, Title 79, of the Revised
Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended (relating to revolving loans and
triparty accounts), shall not apply to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents
or the Other Agreements.

thereof, each conversion of all or a portion thereof to another Type and, in

thereto.  Each such endorsement shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
accuracy of the information endorsed. The failure to make any such endorsement

Credit Loan.

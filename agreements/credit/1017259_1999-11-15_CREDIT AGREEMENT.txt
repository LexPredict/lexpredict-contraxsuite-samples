the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such

ARTICLE II

The Credit

SECTION 2.01.  Commitment.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans to the Borrowers from time to
time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will
not result in the aggregate amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans plus the
LC Exposure exceeding the Commitment. Within the foregoing limit and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrowers may borrow, prepay and
reborrow Revolving Loans.

SECTION 2.02.  Note.  The obligations of the Borrowers hereunder with
respect to all Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by a Note in the form of
Exhibit A hereto made by each of the Borrowers.

SECTION 2.03.  Requests for Revolving Borrowings.  To request a Revolving
Borrowing, the Borrowers shall notify the Lender of such request by telephone
not later than 11:00 a.m., Boston time, one Business Day before the date of the
proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of a Borrowing to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.04(d) may be
given not later than 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on the date of the proposed
Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall
be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Lender of a written
Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Lender and signed by the Borrowers.

10
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.04.  Letters of Credit.

(a) General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Borrowers may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for their own
account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Lender, at any time and from
time to time during the Availability Period.  In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions
of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the
Borrowers to, or entered into by the Borrowers with, the Lender relating to any
Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions.  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrowers shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Lender) to the Lender
(reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and
specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be
a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which
shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of
Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other
information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter
of Credit.  If requested by the Lender, the Borrowers also shall submit a letter
of credit application on the Lender's standard form in connection with any
request for a Letter of Credit.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended,
renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
of each Letter of Credit the Borrowers shall be deemed to represent and warrant
that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i)
the LC Exposure shall not exceed $500,000 and (ii) the sum of the total
Revolving Loans and LC Exposure shall not exceed the total Commitment.

(c) Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior
to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date; provided, however, that
if requested by the Borrowers a Letter of Credit shall automatically be renewed
and extended for an additional year (but not beyond the date specified in clause
(ii) above) unless the Lender notifies the Borrowers of its refusal to so renew
and extend such Letter of Credit within 30 days prior to the date such Letter of
Credit would otherwise expire.

(d) Reimbursement.  If the Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in
respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC
Disbursement by paying to the Lender an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not
later than 12:00 noon, Boston time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is
made, if any Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior
to 10:00 a.m., Boston time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been
received by the Borrowers prior to such time on such date, then not later than
12:00 noon, Boston time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that
any Borrower receives such notice; provided that the Borrowers may, subject to
the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section
2.03 that such payment be financed with

11
<PAGE>

a Revolving Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
Borrowers' obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by
the resulting Borrowing.

(e) Obligations Absolute.  The Borrowers' obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (d) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Lender under a Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the
terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers' obligations hereunder.
Neither the Lender nor any of its Related Parties shall have any liability or
responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of
any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder
(irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission
or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any
Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from
causes beyond the control of the Lender; provided that the foregoing shall not
be construed to excuse the Lender from liability to the Borrowers to the extent
of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of
which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by the Lender's
failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties
hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Lender, the Lender shall be deemed to have
exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and
without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to
documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance
with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Lender may, in its sole discretion,
either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are
not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

(f) Disbursement Procedures.  The Lender shall, promptly following its
receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for
payment under a Letter of Credit.  The Lender shall promptly notify the
Borrowers by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and
whether the Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the
Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse the Lender with respect to any such
LC Disbursement.

(g) Interim Interest.  If the Lender shall make any LC Disbursement,
then, unless the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the
date such LC Disbursement is made, the

12
<PAGE>

unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the
date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrowers
reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate provided for in Section 2.10(b).
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
Lender.

(h) Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrowers receive notice from the
Lender demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the
Borrowers shall deposit in an account with the Lender, an amount in cash equal
to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest and fees
thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall
become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of
Article VII.  Such deposit shall be held by the Lender as collateral for the
payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this
Agreement.  The Lender shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  All such deposits shall be
invested, at the option of the Borrowers, in certificates of deposit issued by
the Lender or in a Lender sponsored money market fund.  Interest or profits, if
any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such
account shall be applied by and paid to the Lender as reimbursement for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy any other obligations of the
Borrowers under this Agreement.  If the Borrowers are required to provide an
amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned
to the Borrowers within three Business Days after all Events of Default have
been cured or waived.

SECTION 2.05.  Funding of Borrowings.  The Lender will make Loans
available to the Borrowers by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in
like funds, to an account of any Borrower maintained with the Lender in Boston
and designated by the Borrowers in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided
that Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as
provided in Section 2.04(d) shall be remitted to the Lender.

SECTION 2.06.  Termination and Reduction of Commitment.

(a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitment shall terminate on
the Maturity Date.

(b) The Borrowers may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Commitment; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitment shall
be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than
$1,000,000 and (ii) the Borrowers shall not terminate or reduce the Commitment
if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance
with Section 2.08, the sum of the outstanding amount of all Loans plus the LC
Exposure would exceed the Commitment.

13
<PAGE>

(c) The Borrowers shall notify the Lender of any election to terminate
or reduce the Commitment under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three
Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction,
specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Each notice delivered
by the Borrowers pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable.

SECTION 2.07.  Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

(a) The Borrowers hereby unconditionally promise to pay to the Lender
the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date.

(b) The Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to the Lender
resulting from each Loan made by the Lender, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to the Lender from time to time hereunder.

(c) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts
of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of the Lender to
maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

SECTION 2.08.  Prepayment of Loans.  The Borrowers shall have the right at
any time and from time to time to prepay without penalty any Borrowing in whole
or in part.

SECTION 2.09.  Fees.

(a) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Lender a nonusage fee, which
shall accrue at the rate of 0.375% per annum on the average daily amount of any
unused portion of the Commitment during the period from and including the date
hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates.  Accrued
nonusage fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June,
September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitment
terminates, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof.
As used herein, usage of the Lender's Commitment includes Revolving Loans and LC
Exposure.  All nonusage fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360
days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed.

(b) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Lender a fee with respect to all
outstanding Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the rate of 1.5% per annum
on the average daily amount of the Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion
thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements), as well as the Lender's
standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.  Such fees shall be
payable in advance upon the issuance of any Letter of Credit.  All such fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for
the actual number of days elapsed.

14
<PAGE>

(c) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Lender a closing fee as set
forth in the letter from it to NMT Medical, Inc. dated June 18, 1999.

SECTION 2.10.  Interest.

(a) All Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrowers hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 4%.

(c) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitment;
provided that interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section shall
be payable on demand.

(d) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed.  The
applicable Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Lender, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.11.  Increased Costs.

(a)  If any Change in Law shall:

(i)   impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, the Lender; or

(ii)  impose on the Lender any other condition affecting this
Agreement or any Loans made by the Lender or any Letter of Credit issued
hereunder;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to the
Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to
make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to the Lender of issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by the Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to the Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate the Lender for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.

(b) If the Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital
requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
Lender's capital as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by the
Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Lender, to a level below that
which the Lender could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration

15
<PAGE>

the Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time
the Borrowers will pay to the Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate the Lender for any such reduction suffered.

(c) A certificate of the Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for any such additional payment and the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate the Lender as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall
be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
The Borrowers shall pay the Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

(d) Failure or delay on the part of the Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of the Lender's right to
demand such compensation; provided that any such demand shall be made within 90
days of the event or condition giving rise to the demand on which it is based.

SECTION 2.12.  Taxes.

(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrowers hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrowers shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section), the Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall make
such deductions and (iii) the Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  In
addition, the Borrowers shall pay all Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) The Borrowers shall indemnify the Lender within 10 days after
written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes paid by the Lender on or with respect to any payment by or on account of
any obligation of the Borrowers hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to the Borrowers by the Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

(c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrowers to a Governmental Authority, the Borrowers shall
deliver to the Lender the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Lender.

16
<PAGE>

SECTION 2.13.  Payments Generally.

(a) The Borrowers shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC
Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.11 or 2.12, or otherwise)
prior to 2:00 p.m., Boston time, on the date when due, in immediately available
funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on
any date shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business
Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be
made to the Lender at its offices in Boston, Massachusetts, except that payments
pursuant to Sections 2.11, 2.12 and 8.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a
Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest
thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments
hereunder shall be made in dollars.

(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Lender to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements,
and interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first,
towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, and (ii) second,
towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due
hereunder.

SECTION 2.14.  Senior Status of Obligations.  All rights of the Lender
with respect to the payment and performance of all obligations of the Borrowers
hereunder of every kind and description, whether now existing or hereafter
arising, shall be senior to all rights of the holders of the Whitney Notes, and
such rights of the Lender shall not be subordinated in right of payment to any
other Indebtedness of any Borrower or Subsidiary.

reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally
and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law.

properties for their intended purposes.

(b) Each of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to

any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected

18
<PAGE>

to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Attached hereto as Schedule 3.05 is a
complete and accurate list of all of the patents and patent applications owned
by the Borrowers as of the date hereof.

SECTION 3.06.  Litigation and Environmental Matters.

(a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any

Borrowers, threatened against or affecting any Borrower or Subsidiary (i) as to
which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

(b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, no Borrower or Subsidiary (i)

and the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of

Adverse Effect.

19
<PAGE>

SECTION 3.10  ERISA.  No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $10,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present
value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on
the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements
reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $25,000 the fair market value of
the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

SECTION 3.11  Disclosure.  The Borrowers have disclosed to the Lender all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which any of them
or any Subsidiary is subject, and all other matters known to them, that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.  None of the reports, financial statements,
certificates or other information (other than any such information provided in
draft or preliminary form) furnished by or on behalf of the Borrowers to the
Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered
hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished)
contains any material misstatement of fact or, when taken together, omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that,
with respect to projected financial information or other information provided in
estimated form, the Borrowers represent only that such information was prepared
in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

SECTION 3.12.  Year 2000.  Any reprogramming required to permit the proper
functioning, in and following the year 2000, of (i) the Borrowers' and the
Subsidiaries' computer systems and (ii) equipment containing embedded microchips
(including systems and equipment supplied by others or with which any of the
Borrower's or Subsidiary's systems interface) and the testing of all such
systems and equipment, as so reprogrammed, will be completed by December 1999.

and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of year 2000 to the Borrowers and
the Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, reprogramming errors and the
failure of others' systems or equipment) will not result in a Default or a
Material Adverse Effect.  Except for such of the reprogramming referred to in
the preceding sentence as may be necessary, the computer and management
information systems of the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries are and, with ordinary
course upgrading and maintenance, will continue for the term of this Agreement
to be, sufficient to permit the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries to conduct their
respective businesses without Material Adverse Effect.

communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and
other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be

Massachusetts 02210-1625, Attention of Chief Financial Officer (Telecopy
No. 617-737-0924), with a copy to Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street,

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto.  All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

SECTION 8.02  Waivers; Amendments.

(a) No failure or delay by the Lender in exercising any right or power
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of
the Lender hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this
Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not
be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Lender may
have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Lender and the Borrowers.

SECTION 8.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

(a) The Borrowers shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements
of counsel for the Lender, in connection with the preparation and administration
of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions
hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lender
in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter
of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for the Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection
of its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this
Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued
hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of
Credit.

35
<PAGE>

(b) The Borrowers shall indemnify the Lender, and each Related Party
of the Lender (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold
each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or
delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby,
the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder
or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom
(including any refusal by the Lender to honor a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do
not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual
or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
owned or operated by any Borrower or Subsidiary, or any Environmental Liability
related in any way to any Borrower or Subsidiary, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall
assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use
of the proceeds thereof.

(d) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than
five Business Days after written demand therefor.

SECTION 8.04. Successors and Assigns.  The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower may
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Lender (and any attempted assignment or
transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing
in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of the Lender) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.05. Survival; Nature of Obligations.  All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by any Borrower herein and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement shall be joint and several obligations of all of the Borrowers,
and shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any
Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless

36
<PAGE>

of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and
notwithstanding that the Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default
or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal
of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable
under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is
outstanding and so long as the Commitment has not expired or terminated. The
provisions of Sections 2.11, 2.12 and 8.03 shall survive and remain in full
force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters
of Credit and the Commitment or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

SECTION 8.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement, the other
documents contemplated hereby and any separate letter agreements with respect to
fees payable to the Lender constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Lender and when the Lender
shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.07. Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

SECTION 8.08. Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at
any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set
off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by the Lender or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrowers now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not the
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
obligations may be unmatured. The rights of the Lender under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which
it may have.

37
<PAGE>

SECTION 8.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

(b) Each of the Borrowers hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sitting in Suffolk County
and of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such Commonwealth of Massachusetts or, to the extent permitted
by law, such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the
Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

(c) Each of the Borrowers hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.01.  Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law.

SECTION 8.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 8.11. Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

SECTION 8.12. Confidentiality.  The Lender agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees
and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement,
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit,
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights
hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this Section, to any assignee of or participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrowers or (h) to the extent
such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a
breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than any Borrower. For the purposes of
this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrowers or
any Subsidiary relating to the Borrowers and the Subsidiaries or their
businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Lender on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrowers or such Subsidiary;
provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrowers or any
Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the
time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

conversion of Eurodollar Loan shall only be made on the last day of the
Eurodollar Interest Period with respect thereof, and (ii) to convert all or any
part of its Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Lender irrevocable
written notice of such election three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed
conversion and such conversion shall be made on the requested conversion date
or, if such requested conversion date is not a Business Day on the next
succeeding Business Day. Any such conversion shall not be deemed to be a
prepayment of any of the Loans for purposes of this Agreement on the Revolving
Note.


ARTICLE V

CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES


SECTION 5.1. UNAVAILABILITY OF FUNDS OR INADEQUACY OF PRICING. In the
event that, in connection with any proposed Eurodollar Loan, the Lender
determines, which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties, due to changes in circumstances since
the date hereof, adequate and fair means do not exist for determining the
Eurodollar Rate or such rate will not accurately reflect the costs to the Lender
of funding Eurodollar Loans for such Eurodollar Interest Period, the Lender
shall give notice of such determination to the Borrower, whereupon, until the
Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension no longer exist, the obligation of the Lender to make, continue or
convert Loans into Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended, and all loans to
Borrower shall be Base Rate Loans during the period of suspension.

SECTION 5.2. CHANGE IN LAWS. If at any time after the date hereof any
new law or any change in existing laws or in the interpretation by any
governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the
administration or interpretation thereof, of any new or existing laws shall make
it unlawful for the Lender to make or continue to maintain or fund Eurodollar
Loans hereunder, then Lender shall promptly notify Borrower in writing of
Lender's



Page 19 of 58
<PAGE>

obligation to make, continue or convert Loans into Eurodollar Loans under this
Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for Lender to make
or maintain Eurodollar Loans. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower shall either
repay the outstanding Eurodollar Loans owed to the Lender, without penalty, on
the last day of the current Interest Periods (or, if Lender may not lawfully
continue to maintain and fund such Eurodollar Loans, immediately), or Borrower
may convert such Eurodollar Loans at such appropriate time to Base Rate Loans.

SECTION 5.3. INCREASED COST OR REDUCED RETURN.

(i) If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any
applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule,
or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

(A) shall subject Lender to any tax, duty, or
other charge with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, the
Revolving Note, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans,
or change the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to
Lender under this Agreement, or the Revolving Note, in
respect of any Eurodollar Loans (other than franchise taxes
and taxes imposed on the overall net income of Lender);

(B) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any
reserve, special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement
(other than reserve requirements, if any, taken into account
in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate) relating to any
extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits
with or other liabilities or commitments of, Lender,
including the Commitment of Lender hereunder; or

(C) shall impose on Lender or on the London
interbank market any other condition affecting this
Agreement or the Revolving Note or any of such extensions of
credit or liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender of
making, converting into, continuing, or maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to
reduce any sum received or receivable by Lender under this Agreement or the
Revolving Note with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then pursuant to Section
5.3(v) Borrower shall pay to Lender such amount or amounts as will compensate
Lender for such increased cost or reduction. If Lender requests compensation by
Borrower under this Section 5.3., Borrower may, by notice to Lender, suspend the
obligation of Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Loans, or to convert all or
part of the Base Rate Loan owing to Lender to Eurodollar Loans, until the event
or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case
the provisions of Section 5.3. shall be applicable); provided that such
suspension shall not affect the right of Lender to receive the compensation so
requested.



Page 20 of 58
<PAGE>

(ii) If, after the date hereof, Lender shall have determined
that the adoption of any applicable law, rule, or regulation regarding capital
adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency, has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of Lender or
any corporation controlling Lender as a consequence of Lender's obligations
hereunder to a level below that which Lender or such corporation could have
achieved but for such adoption, change, request, or directive (taking into
consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to
time pursuant to Section 5.3(v) Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate Lender for such reduction.

(iii) Lender shall promptly notify Borrower of any event of
which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle
Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 5.3. will designate a separate
lending office, if applicable, if such designation will avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of Lender,
be otherwise disadvantageous to it. If Lender claims compensation under this
Section 5.3., Lender shall simultaneously furnish to Borrower a statement
setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such
amount, Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

(iv) If Lender gives notice to the Borrower pursuant to
Section 5.3. hereof, Lender shall simultaneously give to the Borrower a
statement signed by an officer of Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for, and the calculation of such additional cost, reduced payments or
capital requirements, as the case may be, and the additional amounts required to
compensate Lender therefor.

(v) Within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Borrower
of any notice referred to in Section 5.3., the Borrower shall pay to Lender such
additional amounts as are required to compensate Lender for the increased cost,
reduce payments or increase capital requirements identified therein, as the case
may be; provided, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to compensate Lender
for any increased costs, reduced payments or increased capital requirements to
the extent that Lender incurs the same prior to a date six (6) months before
Lender gives the required notice.

SECTION 5.4. BREAKAGE COSTS. Without duplication under any other
provision hereof, if Lender incurs any actual loss, cost or expense (including,
without limitation, any loss of profit and loss, cost, expense or premium
reasonably incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or
other funds acquired by Lender to fund or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or the
relending or reinvesting of such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to the
Lender as a result of any of the following events other than any such occurrence
as a result in the change of circumstances described in Sections 5.1. and 5.2.:



Page 21 of 58
<PAGE>

(i) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar
Loan on a date other than the last day of its Eurodollar Interest
Period (whether by acceleration, prepayment or otherwise);

(ii) any failure to make a principal payment of a Eurodollar
Loan on the due date thereof; or

(iii) any failure by the Borrower to borrow, continue,
prepay or convert to a Eurodollar Loan on the dates specified in a
notice given pursuant to this Agreement.

then the Borrower shall within 15 days after demand pay to Lender such amount as
will reimburse Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If Lender makes such a
claim for compensation, it shall simultaneously furnish to Borrower a statement
setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail
(including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss,
cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such statement shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error.

of the incremental amount of any increase to the Borrowing Base Amount shall be
owed by Borrower to the Lender, and such fee shall be payable by Borrower upon
its acceptance of said increase; provided, however, if the Borrowing Base Amount
is reduced and then reinstated to a higher amount, the additional facility fee
will be applicable only to the incremental amount, if any, by which the higher
amount exceeds the previous highest Borrowing Base Amount. The Borrower hereby
authorizes the Lender to debit its account maintained with the Lender for

less than 90%, the unused fee is 0.50%; and (iii) if the Borrowing Base Usage is
less than 50%, the unused fee is 0.375%. The unused fee will be payable
quarterly in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing June 30,
2002. The unused portion of the Borrowing Base Amount shall be determined on a
daily basis by subtracting from the Borrowing Base Amount the Total
Outstandings, and by averaging said daily amounts for the period for which the
fee is to be determined. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lender to debit its
account maintained with the Lender for collection of the unused fee.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender as follows:

SECTION 11.1. CORPORATE AUTHORITY OF THE BORROWER. The Borrower is a
corporation duly created, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws
of the state its incorporation, and is duly qualified and in good standing as
foreign corporation in Louisiana and all other jurisdictions where the failure
to qualify would have an adverse effect upon its ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and all Related Documents to which it is a
party. The Borrower has the corporate power to enter into this Agreement,
execute the Revolving Note, Mortgage, Security Agreement, and grant the liens
and security interests in the Collateral in the manner and for the purpose
contemplated by the Collateral Documents. The Borrower has the corporate power
to perform its obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents and Related
Documents. The execution, delivery, and performance by the Borrower of the Loan
Documents and Related Documents have all been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate or company action, and do not and will not result in any violation by
the Borrower of any provision of any law, rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, decree, determination or award presently in effect having
applicability to the Borrower, or the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
the Borrower. Except as set forth in Schedule 11.1 attached hereto, the making
and performance by the Borrower of the Loan Documents and Related Documents do
not and will not result in a breach of or constitute a default under any
material indenture or loan or credit agreement or any other material agreement
or instrument to which the Borrower is a party or by which it may be bound or
affected, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any mortgage,
deed of trust, pledge, lien, security interest or other charge or encumbrance of
any nature (other than as contemplated by the Related Documents) upon or with
respect to any of the properties now owned or hereafter acquired by the
Borrower. Each of the Loan Documents and Related Documents to which the Borrower
is a party constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower,
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

SECTION 11.2. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The most recent balance sheet of
the Borrower at the dates thereof, and the related statements of income and
retained earnings for the year then ended, copies of which have been delivered
to the Lender fairly present in all material respects the financial condition of
the Borrower as of the date or dates thereof. Each of said financial statements
were prepared in conformity with GAAP and, except as otherwise disclosed to
Lender in writing, applied on a basis consistent with the preceding year. No
Material Adverse Effect has occurred since said dates in the financial position
or in the results of operations of the Borrower in its business taken as a
whole.

SECTION 11.3. TITLE TO MORTGAGED PROPERTIES. Except as set forth on
Schedule 11.3 attached hereto, the Borrower has Defensible Title to the
Mortgaged Properties at a book cost in excess of $200,000 (except to the extent
that (a) such assets have thereafter been disposed of in compliance with this
Agreement or (b) leases for such property have expired pursuant to their terms),
and, in each case free and clear of all Encumbrances except (other than
Permitted



Page 27 of 58
<PAGE>

Encumbrances) (i) Encumbrances for taxes not yet due and payable or, if payable,
that are being contested in good faith in the ordinary course of business, (ii)
statutory Encumbrances (including materialmen's, mechanic's, repairmen's,
landlord's and other similar encumbrances) arising in the ordinary course of
business to secure payments not yet due and payable or, if payable, that are
being contested in good faith in the ordinary course of business, (iii)
easements, restrictions, reservations or other encumbrances, as well as such
imperfections or irregularities of title, if any, as are not material, (iv)
obligations or duties to any municipality or public authority with respect to
any franchise, grant, license or permit and all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority, (v) all lessors'
royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, production payments,
carried interests, reversionary interests and other burdens on or deductions
from the proceeds of production, (vi) the terms and conditions of joint
operating agreements and other oil and gas contracts, (vii) all rights to
consent by, required notices to, and filings with or other actions by
governmental or tribal entities, if any, in connection with the change of
ownership or control of an interest in federal, state, tribal or other domestic
governmental oil and gas leases, if the same are customarily obtained subsequent
to such change of ownership or control, but only insofar as such consents,
notices, filings and other actions relate to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (viii) any preferential purchase rights, (ix) required third
party consents to assignment, (x) conventional rights of reassignment prior to
abandonment and (xi) the terms and provisions of oil and gas leases, unit
agreements, pooling agreements, and other documents creating interests
comprising the oil and gas properties; provided, however, the exceptions
described in clauses (iv) through (xi) inclusive above are qualified to include
only those exceptions in each case which do not operate to (A) reduce the net
revenue interest of the Borrower below that set forth on Schedule 11.3, (B)
increase the proportionate share of costs and expenses of leasehold operations
attributable to or to be borne by the working interest of the Borrower above
that set forth on Schedule 11.3 without a proportionate increase in the net
revenue interest of the Borrower or (C) increase the working interest of the
Borrower above that set forth on Schedule 11.3 without a proportionate increase
in the net revenue interest of the Borrower, and, provided, further, that the
foregoing defects, limitations, liens and encumbrances, whether individually
material or not, do not in the aggregate create a Material Adverse Effect upon
the Borrower (the categories of exceptions in clauses (iv) through (xi), as so
qualified and as any such exceptions may exist from time to time, being referred
to as the "DESIGNATED TITLE EXCEPTIONS"). The Mortgage constitutes a legal,
valid and perfected first Encumbrance on the property interests covered thereby,
subject only to Designated Title Exceptions, Permitted Encumbrances, and matters
disclosed on Schedule 11.3. Further, as of the date hereof, the oil and gas
properties constituting not less than ninety percent (90%) of the present value

there are no legal actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower, or any
of its properties before any court or administrative agency (federal, state or
local), which could reasonably be expected to constitute a Material Adverse
Effect, and there are no judgments or decrees affecting the Borrower, or its
property (including, without limitation, the Collateral) which are or could
reasonably be expected to become an Encumbrance against such property (other
than a Designated Title Exception or a Permitted Encumbrance), provided that no

days after the date of entry thereof or an appeal or appropriate proceeding for
review thereof is taken within such period and a stay of execution pending such
appeal is obtained.

exemption of, nor any filing or registration with, any governmental body or
regulatory authority (federal, state or local), and no vote, consent or approval
of the shareholders of the Borrower is or will be required in connection with
the execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Related Documents or the
performance by the Borrower of its obligations hereunder and under the other
Related Documents, except to the extent obtained.

with insurance companies in such amounts and against such risks as is usually
carried by owners of similar businesses and properties in the same general areas
in which Borrower operates.

SECTION 11.7. LICENSES. The Borrower possesses adequate franchises,
licenses and permits to own its properties and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

10.1, the Borrower is not a party to any agreement or instrument, nor subject to
any charter or other restriction, materially and adversely affecting the
business, properties, assets, or operations of the Borrower or its condition
(financial or otherwise), and the Borrower is not in default in the performance,
observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions
contained in any agreement or instrument to which it is a party, which default
would constitute a Material Adverse Effect.

Default hereunder has occurred and is continuing or will occur as a result of
the giving effect hereto.

SECTION 11.10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Each employee benefit plan as

with all applicable requirements of law and regulations, and (i) no Reportable
Event (as defined in ERISA) has occurred and is continuing with respect to any
such plan, (ii) the Borrower has not withdrawn from any such plan or initiated
steps to do so, and (iii) no steps have been taken to terminate any such plan.

principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the

Reserve System), and none of the proceeds of the Loans will be used for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying such margin stock.

SECTION 11.14. LOCATION OF OFFICES AND RECORDS. As of the date hereof,
the chief place of business of the Borrower, and the office where the Borrower

such information hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the
Lender will be, true and accurate in every material respect on the date as of
which such information is dated or certified; and none of such information is or
will be incomplete by omitting to state any material fact necessary to make such
information not misleading as of such date, taken as a whole. To the best
knowledge of Borrower, the engineering reports delivered to the Lender in

connection herewith were prepared in good faith on the basis of the assumptions
believed by the Borrower in good faith to be reasonable in light of the then
current and foreseeable business conditions of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
at the time of preparation thereof, it being understood by the Lender that
actual results may vary from projected results.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Commitment
will, at the option of the Lender, either terminate or be suspended (including
any obligation to make any further Revolving Loans), and, at the Lender's
option, the Revolving Note and all Indebtedness of the Borrower will become
immediately due and payable, all without notice of any kind to the Borrower,
except that in the case of type described in the "Insolvency" subsection above,
such acceleration shall be automatic and not optional. Nothing contained in this
Article 14 shall be construed to limit or amend in any way the Events of Default
enumerated in the Revolving Note or any other Loan Document, or any other
document executed in connection with the transaction contemplated herein.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, the Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time,
without notice to Borrower or Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived
by Borrower and Guarantor), to set-off and apply any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by any of the Lender to or for the credit or the
account of Borrower against any and all of the indebtedness of Borrower under
the Revolving Note and the Loan Documents, including this Agreement,
irrespective of whether or not the Lender shall have made any demand under the
Loan Documents, including this Agreement or the Revolving Note and although such
indebtedness may be unmatured. Any amount set-off by the Lender shall be applied
against the indebtedness owed the Lender by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement
and the Revolving Note. The Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrower after any
such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of the
Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which the Lender may
have.

SECTION 14.2. WAIVERS. Except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement and by applicable law, the Borrower and the Guarantor waive to the
extent permitted by applicable law (i) presentment, demand and protest and
notice of presentment, dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of
acceleration, protest, default, nonpayment, maturity, release, compromise,
settlement, extension or renewal of any or all commercial paper, accounts,

be liable and hereby ratify and confirm whatever the Lender may do in this
regard, (ii) all rights to notice and a hearing prior to the Lender's taking
possession or control of, or to the Lender's replevy, attachment or levy upon,

benefit of all valuation, appraisal and exemption laws. The Borrower and the

SECTION 15.6. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the Revolving Note

any such participation interest will be considered as the absolute owners of
such interests in such Indebtedness. In addition, any sale of a participation
interest in the Indebtedness prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default will

financial data concerning Borrower and the Guarantor. The Borrower and the
Guarantor agree to enter into an amendment or restatement of this Agreement and
any of the Related Documents in order to facilitate such syndication; provided,
however, any syndication prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default will
require the Borrower's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. In addition, the Lender is expressly authorized to seek additional
lending institutions to become a lender hereunder to fund any increase to the
Borrowing Base Amount.

SECTION 15.9. INDEMNITY.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 12.6 as to matters
addressed therein, the Borrower and the Guarantor agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the Lender and its officers, employees, agents, attorneys and
representatives (singularly, an "Indemnified Party", and collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") from and against any loss, cost, liability, damage or
expense (including the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel to
the Lender, including all local counsel hired by such counsel) ("Claim")
incurred by the Lender in investigating or preparing for, defending against, or
providing evidence, producing documents or taking any other action in respect of
any commenced or threatened litigation, administrative proceeding or
investigation under any federal securities law, federal or state environmental
law, or any other statute of any jurisdiction, or any regulation, or at common
law or otherwise, which is alleged to arise out of or is based upon any acts,
practices or omissions or alleged acts, practices or omissions of Borrower and
the Guarantor, or its or their agents or arises in connection with the duties,
obligations or performance of the Indemnified Parties in negotiating, preparing,
executing, accepting, keeping, completing, countersigning, issuing, selling,
delivering, releasing, assigning, handling, certifying, processing or receiving
or taking any other action with respect to the Loan Documents and all documents,
items and materials contemplated thereby even if any of the foregoing arises out
of an Indemnified Party's ordinary negligence. The indemnity set forth herein
shall be in addition to any other obligations or liabilities of Borrower and the
Guarantor to the Lender hereunder or at common law or otherwise, and shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, the expiration of the Revolving Loans
and the payment of all indebtedness of Borrower to the Lender hereunder and
under the Revolving Note, provided that Borrower and the Guarantor shall have no
obligation under this Section to the Indemnified Parties with respect to any of
the foregoing arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Indemnified Parties. If any Claim is asserted against any Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall endeavor to notify Borrower and the Guarantor of such
Claim (but failure to do so shall not affect the indemnification herein made
except to the extent of the actual harm caused by such failure). The Indemnified
Party shall have the right to employ, at Borrower's expense, counsel of the
Indemnified Parties' choosing and to control the defense of the Claim. The
Borrower or Guarantor may at its/their own expense also participate in the
defense of any Claim. Each Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel in
connection with any Claim to the extent such Indemnified Party believes it
reasonably prudent to protect such Indemnified Party. THE PARTIES INTEND FOR THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION TO APPLY TO AND PROTECT EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY FROM
THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY LIABILITY INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED OR
THREATENED TO BE IMPOSED ON INDEMNIFIED PARTY AS WELL AS FROM THE



Page 54 of 58
<PAGE>

CONSEQUENCES OF ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT NEGLIGENCE IS THE SOLE,
CONTRIBUTING, OR CONCURRING CAUSE OF ANY CLAIM.

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle any claim to be indemnified
without the consent of the indemnitor, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld; provided, that the indemnitor may not reasonably withhold consent to
any settlement that an Indemnified Party proposes, if the indemnitor does not
have the financial ability to pay all its obligations outstanding and asserted
against the indemnitor at that time, including, without limitation, the maximum
potential claims pending or to the knowledge of the indemnitee threatened
against the Indemnified Party to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 15.9.

SECTION 15.10. MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE. Regardless of any provisions
contained in this Agreement or in any other documents and instruments referred
to herein, the Lender shall never be deemed to have contracted for or be
entitled to receive, collect or apply as interest on the Revolving Note any
amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, and in the event Lender ever receives,
collects or applies as interest any such excess, of if an acceleration of the
maturity of the Revolving Note or if any prepayment by Borrower results in
Borrower having paid any interest in excess of the Maximum Rate, such amount
which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Note for which such excess was
received, collected or applied, and, if the principal balance of the Revolving
Note is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to Borrower.
All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the use, forbearance or
detention of the indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving Note and/or this
Agreement shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness
until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of such
indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate. In determining whether or not the
interest paid or payable under any specific contingency exceeds the Maximum Rate
of interest permitted by law, Borrower and the Lender shall, to the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal
payment as an expense, fee or premium, rather than as interest; and (ii) exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effect thereof; and (iii) compare the total amount
of interest contracted for, charged or received with the total amount of
interest which could be contracted for, charged or received throughout the
entire contemplated term of the Revolving Note at the Maximum Rate.

SECTION 15.11.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.

(a) THE BORROWER, THE GUARANTOR, AND THE LENDER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO WHICH THE BORROWER, THE GUARANTOR, AND THE

offending provision shall be deemed to be modified to be within the limits of

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned CARRIZO OIL & GAS, INC., a Texas
corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Borrower") hereby unconditionally
promises to pay to the order of HIBERNIA NATIONAL BANK (the "Lender") at 313
Carondelet Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130, the principal sum of THIRTY
MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($30,000,000.00), in lawful money of the United
States of America together with interest from the date funds are made available
to the Borrower hereunder until paid at the rates specified in the Credit
Agreement (as hereinafter defined). All payments of principal and interest due
hereunder are payable at the office of Lender at 313 Carondelet Street, New
Orleans, Louisiana 70130, or at such other address as Lender shall designate in
writing to Borrower.

The principal and all accrued interest on this Note shall be due and
payable in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement.

This Note is executed pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement
dated of even date herewith among Borrower, CCBM, Inc., and Lender (the "Credit
Agreement"). Reference is made to the Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents
(as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement) for a statement of prepayment,
rights and obligations of Borrower, for a statement of the terms and conditions
under which the due date of this Note may be accelerated and for statements
regarding other matters affecting this Note (including without limitation the
obligations of the holder hereof to advance funds hereunder, principal and
interest payment due dates, voluntary and mandatory prepayments, exercise of
rights and remedies, payment of attorneys' fees, court costs and other costs of
collection and certain waivers by Borrower and others now or hereafter obligated
for payment of any sums due hereunder). Upon the occurrence of an Event of

holder hereof (i) may declare forthwith to be entirely and immediately due and
payable the principal balance hereof and the interest accrued hereon, and (ii)
shall have all rights and remedies of the Lender under the Credit Agreement and
Loan Documents. This Note may be prepaid in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Credit Agreement. Reference is made to the Credit Agreement
for provisions concerning the applicable procedures for Advances under this
Note. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN CONTAINED TO THE CONTRARY, THE MAXIMUM
AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL ADVANCES AT ANY TIME OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS NOTE (AND
LENDER'S OBLIGATION TO ADVANCE HEREUNDER) SHALL NOT EXCEED THE BORROWER BASE
AMOUNT (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) THEN IN EFFECT. Unless otherwise
defined herein, each capitalized term used herein shall have the same meaning
set forth in the Credit Agreement.

If Lender declares this Note to be in default, Lender has the right
prospectively (immediately following any applicable cure period) to adjust and
fix the simple interest rate under this Note until this Note is paid in full, as
follows: the fixed default interest rate shall be equal to twenty-one (21%)
percent per annum, or three (3%) percent per annum in excess of the interest
rate under this Note at the time of default, whichever is greater.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder hereof shall never be entitled to
receive, collect or apply, as interest on this Note, any amount in excess of the
Maximum Rate (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement), and, if the
holder hereof ever receives, collects, or applies as interest, any such amount
which would be excessive interest, it shall be deemed a partial prepayment of
principal and treated hereunder as such; and, if the indebtedness evidenced
hereby is paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be paid to
Borrower. In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any
specific contingency, exceeds the Maximum Rate, Borrower and the holder hereof
shall, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law (i) characterize any
non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as interest,
(ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) spread the
total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the
obligations evidenced by this Note and/or referred to in the Credit Agreement so
that the interest rate is uniform throughout the entire term of this Note;
provided that, if this Note is paid and performed in full prior to the end of
the full contemplated term thereof; and if the interest received for the actual
period of existence thereof exceeds the Maximum Rate, the holder hereof shall
refund to Borrower the amount of such excess or credit the amount of such excess
against the indebtedness evidenced hereby, and, in such event, the holder hereof
shall not be subject to any penalties provided by any laws for contracting for,
charging, taking, reserving or receiving interest in excess of the Maximum Rate.

If any payment of principal or interest on this Note shall become
due on a day other than a Business Day (as such term is defined in the Credit
Agreement), such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in computing interest in
connection with such payment.

If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection,
or if it is collected through any legal proceeding at law or in equity or in
bankruptcy, receivership or other court proceedings, Borrower agree to pay all
reasonable costs of collection, including, but not limited to, court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees.

Borrower and each surety, endorser, guarantor and other party ever
liable for payment of any sums of money payable on this Note, jointly and
severally waive presentment and demand for payment, notice of intention to
accelerate the maturity, protest, notice of protest and nonpayment, as to this
Note and as to each and all installments hereof, and agree that their liability
under this Note shall be joint, several and solidary, and shall not be affected
by any renewal or extension in the time of payment hereof, or in any
indulgences, or by any release or change in any security for the payment of this
Note, and hereby consent to any and all renewals, extensions, indulgences,
releases or changes.

Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that loans evidenced by
this Note were entered into primarily for commercial or business purposes as
provided in La. R. S. 9:3509.

As security for the prompt and punctual payment of this Note,
Borrower collaterally assigns and pledges to Lender any rights which Borrower
may have to funds which Borrower maintains on deposit with Lender (with the
exception of funds deposited in tax-deferred accounts), and agrees that Lender
may, upon occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement and the
expiration of any applicable grace period allowed to cure the Event of Default,
apply such funds on deposit with Lender against the unpaid balance of this Note.

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
applicable laws of the State of Louisiana.

THIS WRITTEN NOTE, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS
SET FORTH THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF AND SUPERSEDE ALL PRIOR WRITTEN AND ORAL UNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN THE

Omnicom Finance Limited), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of
England and Wales ("OFL"); OMNICOM CAPITAL INC., a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of Connecticut ("OCI" and, together with OFI and OFL,
each a "Borrower", and collectively, the "Borrowers" ); OMNICOM GROUP INC. (the
"Guarantor"); each of the financial institutions listed in Schedule I hereto
(each a "Bank", and collectively the "Banks") and CITIBANK, N.A., as

OFI, OFL, certain of the Banks and the Agents are parties to a
364-Day Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 1999 and, together with OCI, are

Agreement), in the amount specified opposite such bank's name on Schedule I to
this Third Amendment and Restatement. Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby
agree to amend the Existing Credit Agreement in certain respects as set forth
herein and to restate the Existing Credit Agreement as so amended (the Existing
Credit Agreement as so amended and restated, the "Third Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement"):

Section 1. Definitions. Except as otherwise defined herein, terms defined
in the Existing Credit Agreement are used herein as defined therein.

Section 2. Amendments. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent specified in Section 4 of this Third Amendment and Restatement, but
effective on the Effective Date (as defined below), (i) each of the Existing
Credit Agreement and the Guaranty is hereby amended as set forth below, and
(ii) the Existing Credit Agreement is restated to read in its entirety as set
forth in the Existing Credit Agreement, which is hereby incorporated herein by
reference, with the amendments set forth below:

THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT


<PAGE>


A. References in the Existing Credit Agreement to "this Agreement"
(and indirect references such as "hereunder", "hereby", "herein" and
"hereof") shall be deemed to be references to the Third Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement.

B. Section 1.01 of the Existing Credit Agreement shall be amended by
adding the following new definition for "Third Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement" and inserting the same in the appropriate alphabetical location
and by amending and restating the following definition for "Commitment" to
read in its entirety as follows:

"Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement" shall mean this

dated as of July 31, 2000 and the Third Amendment and Restatement
dated as of April 26, 2001 among the Borrowers, the Guarantor, the
Banks signatory thereto and the Agents.

"Commitment" shall mean, for each Bank, the amount set forth

Restated Credit Agreement, as the same may be (x) reduced from time
to time pursuant to Section 4.02 and/or Section 10, (y) increased
pursuant to Section 4.04 and/or (z) adjusted from time to time as a
result of assignments to or from such Bank pursuant to Section
12.04(b).

C. Section 4.03 of the Existing Credit Agreement is amended by
deleting paragraph (a) in its entirety and inserting a new paragraph (a)
as follows:

"(a) The "Commitment Termination Date" shall be April 25, 2002
or such later date to which the Commitment Termination Date has been
extended pursuant to this Section 4.03."

D. Section 4.03(b) of the Existing Credit Agreement is amended by
deleting the reference to "Consent Date (as hereinafter defined)" at the
end of the first sentence and replacing it with "Existing Commitment
Termination Date".

E. Section 4.03(d) of the Existing Credit Agreement is amended by
deleting the reference to "Consent Date" and replacing it with "Existing
Commitment Termination Date".

F. Section 4.04 of the Existing Credit Agreement is amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows:

"4.04 Increase of Commitments. The Guarantor shall have the
right, at any time prior to the then Existing Commitment Termination
Date, without the consent of the Required Banks, to effect an
increase or increases in the Total Commitment to any amount up to
$1,000,000,000; provided that (i) each increase shall be in a
minimum amount of $1,000,000 and multiples of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof; (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing;

THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT


<PAGE>


and (iii) one or more of the existing Banks agree, but are not
required to agree, to increase their respective Commitments
hereunder and/or one or more new banks, satisfactory to the
Guarantor and reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
agree to provide Commitments hereunder. Notice from the Guarantor
requesting such increase shall be given to the Banks, with a copy to
the Administrative Agent, at least three Business Days before the
proposed effective date for such increase. An increase in the Total
Commitments pursuant to this Section 4.04 shall not, however, be
permitted if the Total Commitment shall have been reduced pursuant
to Section 4.02(b) during the preceding four months."

G. Schedule I of the Existing Credit Agreement is deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the schedule set forth in Schedule I to this
Third Amendment and Restatement.

H. Section 6(e) of the Guaranty is hereby amended by deleting the
first reference to "December 31, 1998" in the first sentence thereof and
replacing it with "December 31, 2000" and by deleting the reference to
"December 31, 1998 through the date hereof" in the third sentence thereof
and replacing it with "December 31, 2000 through April 26, 2001".

Section 3. Representations and Warranties. Each Borrower (but only OFI and
OCI with respect to Section 7.09) represents and warrants to the Banks as of the
Effective Date that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 7 of
the Existing Credit Agreement are true and correct as to itself on and as of the
Effective Date as though made on and as of the Effective Date (or, if any such
representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a
specific date, as of such specific date) and as if each reference in said
Section 7 to "this Agreement" included reference to the Third Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement. The Guarantor represents and warrants to the Banks as
of the Effective Date that the representations and warranties (after giving
effect to the amendment in Section 2 H of this Third Amendment and Restatement)
set forth in Section 6 of the Guaranty are true and correct as to itself on and
as of the Effective Date as though made on and as of the Effective Date (or, if
any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of
a specific date, as of such specific date). Each Borrower and the Guarantor
represents and warrants to the Banks as of the Effective Date that no event has
occurred and is continuing that constitutes a Default or Event of Default (and
the parties agree that breach of any of the representations and warranties in
this Section 3 shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 10.02 of the
Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).

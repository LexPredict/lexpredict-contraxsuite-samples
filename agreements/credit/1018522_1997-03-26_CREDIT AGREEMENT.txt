herein, TEXAS COMMERCE BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as

WHEREAS the Company, an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of
Cox Enterprises (such term and each other capitalized term used but not defined
in this Agreement having the meaning set forth in Article I hereof) proposes to
acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of Capital Stock of NewCity
Communications through the merger (the "Merger") of a Wholly Owned Subsidiary
of the Company with and into NewCity Communications (the "Surviving
Corporation") pursuant to the NewCity Merger Agreement.

WHEREAS the Company has requested the Banks to make Loans to
the Company in an aggregate amount not to exceed $300,000,000 at any time
outstanding to be used to finance the payment of the consideration payable in
the Merger of approximately $165,000,000 and additional acquisitions and for

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the
mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as

Commitment. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each Bank severally agrees to make Revolving Loans in Dollars to the
Company on any one or more Business Days on or after the date hereof and prior
to the Maturity Date, up to an aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans
not exceeding at any one time outstanding an amount equal to such Bank's
Commitment made to the Company by such Bank, if any; provided, however, in no
event shall the aggregate outstanding principal amount at any time of the
Revolving Loans and the Discretionary Loans exceed $300,000,000, as such amount
may be reduced pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Each Borrowing shall be
in an aggregate amount of not less than $3,000,000 and an integral multiple of
$250,000. Subject to the foregoing, each Borrowing shall be made simultaneously
from the Banks according to their Pro Rata Shares of the principal amount
requested for each Borrowing, and shall consist of Revolving Loans of the same
type (e.g., CD Rate Loans, Alternate Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans) with
the same Interest Period from each Bank. Within such limits and during such
period, the Company may borrow, repay and reborrow under this Section 2.01(a)
(including, without limitation, reborrowings for the sole purpose of
refinancing any Revolving Loan).

(b)  Borrowing Procedures; Delivery of Proceeds;

Recordation of Loans. (i) Each Borrowing under this Section 2.01 shall be made

Loans, prior oral or written notice from the Company to the Administrative
Agent by 9:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the same day as the requested
Borrowing (and the Administrative Agent shall prior to 12:00 noon (Dallas,
Texas time) on the date such notice is received by the Administrative Agent
provide oral or written notice of the requested Borrowing to the Banks, and
each Reference Bank shall then provide to the Administrative Agent not later
than 12:15 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) oral or written notice of the rate on
overnight Federal funds for such day offered at 12:00 noon (Dallas, Texas time)
by such Reference Bank

to the Company, and the Alternate Base Rate determined by the Administrative
Agent shall be conveyed by the Administrative Agent by oral or written
communication to all of the Banks by 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the
Borrowing Date), (B) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Loans,
three Business Days' prior written or oral notice from the Company to the
Administrative Agent by 9:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) and (C) in the case of a
Borrowing consisting of CD Rate Loans, one Business Day's prior written or oral
notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent by 9:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas
time) (and the Administrative Agent shall, in the case of (B) and (C) above,
provide to each Bank prior oral or written notice of the requested borrowing by
11:30 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on the date such notice is received by the
Administrative Agent) (in each case, a "Notice of Borrowing"); provided,
however, with respect to each oral Notice of Borrowing, the Company shall
deliver promptly (and in any event, no later than two Business Days after the
giving of such oral notice) to the Administrative Agent a confirmatory written
Notice of Borrowing. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall
specify: (w) the total principal amount of the proposed Borrowing, (x) whether
the Borrowing will be comprised of CD Rate Loans, Alternate Base Rate Loans or
Eurodollar Loans, (y) the applicable Interest Period for such Loans (which may
not extend beyond the Maturity Date), and (z) the Borrowing Date. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly give like notice to the other Banks, and on
the Borrowing Date each Bank shall make its Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing
available at the principal banking office of the Administrative Agent, 2200
Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75201, no later than 3:30 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time)
in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Alternate Base Rate Loans, and no
later than 2:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) in the case of all other Borrowings,
in each case in immediately available funds.

(ii) The Administrative Agent shall pay or deliver the
proceeds of each Borrowing to or upon the order of the Company. Each Bank shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts
evidencing the indebtedness to such Bank resulting from each Loan, from time to
time, including, without limitation, the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid such Bank from time to time under this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it



<PAGE>   27


20



will record (A) the principal amount of each Loan made hereunder, the type of
each Loan and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (B) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Company to each Bank hereunder and (C) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder from the Company and each Bank's Pro Rata Share
thereof. The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to this paragraph
shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations
therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Bank or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not
in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay the Loans in
accordance with their terms.

(c) Substitute Rate. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if at any time prior to the determination of the rate
with respect to any proposed Loan (i) the Majority Banks in their discretion
shall determine with respect to Eurodollar Loans to be made by them on the
applicable Borrowing Date of such Loan that there is a reasonable probability
that Dollar deposits will not be offered to such Banks in the interbank
eurodollar market for a period of time equal to the applicable Interest Period
in amounts equal to the amount of each such Bank's Eurodollar Loan in Dollars
or (ii) the Administrative Agent in its discretion shall determine with respect
to CD Rate Loans to be made by the Banks on the applicable Borrowing Date of
such proposed Loan that bid rates will not be provided by certificate of
deposit dealers of recognized standing for the purchase at face value of
certificates of deposit of the Reference Banks for a period of time equal to
the applicable Interest Period in amounts approximately equal or comparable to
the aggregate principal amount of such Loans with a maturity equal to the
applicable Interest Period, then:

(A) the Majority Banks (acting through the Administrative
Agent) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall give the
Company notice thereof, and in the case of subsection (ii) above, the
Adminstrative Agent shall also give the Banks notice thereof, and

(B) Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be made having an
Interest Period of 10 days in lieu of any



<PAGE>   28


21



Eurodollar Loans or CD Rate Loans that were to have been made at such
time.

(d)  Interest.  The Loans shall bear interest as
follows:

(i) Each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
unpaid principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding at a rate
per annum (for the actual number of days elapsed, based on a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be) which shall be equal to the lesser of (A)
the Alternate Base Rate or (B) the Highest Lawful Rate.

(ii) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding at a rate per annum
(for the actual number of days elapsed, based on a year of 360 days) which
shall be equal to the lesser of (A) the Eurodollar Rate plus the
applicable Margin Percentage, or (B) the Highest Lawful Rate.

(iii) Each CD Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding at a rate per annum
(for the actual number of days elapsed, based on a year of 360 days) which
shall equal to the lesser of (A) the CD Rate plus the applicable Margin
Percentage, or (B) the Highest Lawful Rate.

(iv) Interest on the outstanding principal of each Loan shall
accrue from and including the Borrowing Date for such Loan to but
excluding the date such Loan is paid in full and shall be due and payable
(A) on the Interest Payment Date for each such Loan, (B) as to any
Eurodollar Loan having an Interest Period greater than three months, at
the end of the third month of the Interest Period for such Loan, (C) as to
any CD Rate Loan having an Interest Period greater than 90 days, on the
90th day of the Interest Period for such Loan, and (D) as to all Loans, at
maturity, whether by acceleration or otherwise, or after notice of
prepayment in accordance with Section 2.01(e)(i) or Section 3.01(c)
hereof, on and after the Required Prepayment Date or the applicable
prepayment date, as the case may be, as specified in such notice.



<PAGE>   29


22

(v) Past due principal, whether pursuant to acceleration or
the Company's failure to make a prepayment on the date specified in the
applicable prepayment notice or otherwise, and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, past due interest and (after the occurrence of an Event of
Default) past due fees, pursuant to acceleration or otherwise, shall bear
interest from their respective due dates, until paid, at the Default Rate
and shall be due and payable upon demand.

(e) Change of Law. (i) Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if at any time any Bank in good faith determines
(which determination shall be conclusive) that any change after the date hereof
in any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other
governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful (any of the above being
described as a "Eurodollar Event") for such Bank or its foreign branch or
branches to maintain or fund any Loan in Dollars by means of Dollar deposits
obtained in the interbank eurodollar market then, at the option of such Bank,
the aggregate principal amount of each of such Bank's Eurodollar Loans then
outstanding, which Loans are directly affected by such Eurodollar Events, shall
be prepaid in Dollars, and any remaining obligation of such Bank hereunder to
make Eurodollar Loans (but not CD Rate Loans or Alternate Base Rate Loans)
shall be suspended for so long as such Eurodollar Events shall continue. Upon
the occurrence of any Eurodollar Event and at any time thereafter so long as
such Eurodollar Event shall continue, such Bank may exercise its aforesaid
option by giving written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the
Company. Any prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan which is required under this
Section 2.01(e) shall be made, together with accrued and unpaid interest and
all other amounts payable to such Bank under this Agreement with respect to
such prepaid Loan (including, without limitation, amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.01(f)), on the date stated in the notice to the Company referred to
above, which date ("Required Prepayment Date") shall be not less than 15 days
(or such earlier date as shall be necessary to comply with the relevant law,
rule or regulation) from the date of such notice. If any Eurodollar Loan is
required to be prepaid under this Section 2.01(e), the Banks agree that at the
written



<PAGE>   30


23



request of the Company, the Bank that has made such Eurodollar Loan shall make
an Alternate Base Rate Loan or a CD Rate Loan on the Required Prepayment Date
to the Company in the same principal amount, in Dollars, as the Eurodollar Loan
of such Bank being so prepaid. Any such written request by the Company for
Alternate Base Rate Loans or a CD Rate Loan under this Section 2.01(e) shall be
irrevocable and, in order to be effective, must be delivered to the
Administrative Agent not less than one Business Day prior to the Required
Prepayment Date.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company
is required to pay to any Bank amounts with respect to any Borrowing pursuant
to Section 2.01(e)(i), the Company may give notice to such Bank (with copies to
the Administrative Agent) that it wishes to seek one or more assignees (which
may be one or more of the Banks) to assume the Commitment of such Bank and to
purchase its outstanding Loans and the Administrative Agent will use its best
efforts to assist the Company in obtaining an assignee; provided that if more
than one Bank requests that the Company pay substantially and proportionately
equal additional amounts under Section 2.01(e)(i) and the Company elects to
seek an assignee to assume the Commitments of any of such affected Banks, the
Company must seek an assignee or assignees to assume the Commitments of all of
such affected Banks. Each Bank requesting compensation pursuant to Section
2.01(e)(i) agrees to sell its Commitment, Loans and interest in this Agreement
in accordance with Section 14.07 to any such assignee for an amount equal to
the sum of the outstanding unpaid principal of and accrued interest on such
Loans in Dollars plus all other fees and amounts (including, without
limitation, any compensation claimed by such Bank under Section 2.01(e)(i) and
Section 2.01(f)) due such Bank hereunder calculated, in each case, to the date
such Commitment, Loans and interest are purchased. Upon such sale or
prepayment, each such Bank shall have no further Commitment or other obligation
to the Company hereunder.

(f) Funding Losses. In the event of (i) any payment or
prepayment (whether authorized or required hereunder pursuant to acceleration
or otherwise) of all or a portion of any CD Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan on a
day other than an Interest Payment Date, (ii) any payment or prepayment
(whether authorized or required hereunder



<PAGE>   31


24



pursuant to acceleration or otherwise), of any CD Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan
made after the delivery of the Notice of Borrowing for such CD Rate Loan or
Eurodollar Loan, but before the Borrowing Date therefor, if such payment or
prepayment prevents such CD Rate Loan or Eurodollar Loan from being made in
full, (iii) the failure of any Loan to be made by any Bank due to any condition
precedent to a Loan not being satisfied or as a result of this Section 2.01 or
(iv) due to any other action or inaction of the Company, the Company shall pay,
in Dollars, to each affected Bank upon its request made on or before 45 days
after the occurrence of any such event, acting through the Administrative
Agent, such amount or amounts (to the extent such amount or amounts would not
be usurious under applicable law) as may be necessary to compensate such Bank
for any direct or indirect costs and losses incurred by such Bank (including,
without limitation, such amount or amounts as will compensate it for the amount
by which the rate of interest on such Loan immediately prior to such repayment
exceeds the Eurodollar Rate or the CD Rate, for the period from the date of
such prepayment to the Interest Payment Date with respect to such prepaid Loan,
all as determined in good faith by such Bank) but otherwise without penalty.
Any such claim by a Bank for compensation shall be made through the
Administrative Agent and shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an
officer of such Bank authorized to so act on behalf of such Bank, setting forth
the computation upon which such claim is based. The obligations of the Company
under this Section 2.01(f) shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and/or the payment of the obligations hereunder.

(g) Increased Costs--Taxes, Reserve Requirements, Etc. (i)
The Company for and on behalf of each Bank shall pay or cause to be paid
directly to the appropriate governmental authority or shall reimburse or
compensate each Bank upon demand by such Bank, acting through the
Administrative Agent, for all costs incurred, losses suffered or payments made,
as determined by such Bank, by reason of any and all present or future taxes
(including, without limitation, any interest equalization tax or any similar
tax on the acquisition of debt obligations), levies, imposts or any other
charge of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, whether or not
such taxes were correctly or legally asserted, on or with regard to any aspect
of the transactions with respect



<PAGE>   32


25



to this Agreement and the Loans, except such taxes as may be measured by the
overall net income of a Bank or its Lending Office and increase in franchise
taxes imposed by the jurisdiction, or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof, in which such Bank's principal executive office or its
Lending Office is located.

(ii) The Company shall pay immediately upon demand by any
Bank, acting through the Administrative Agent, any applicable stamp and
registration taxes, duties, official and sealed paper taxes, or similar charges
due, or which under currently applicable law could in the future become due, or
which may in the future become due as a result of any change in applicable law,
the interpretation thereof, or otherwise, in connection with any Loans or this
Agreement or in connection with the enforcement hereof.

(iii) If any Bank or the Administrative Agent receives a
refund in respect of taxes for which such Bank or the Administrative Agent has
received payment from the Company hereunder, it shall promptly notify the
Company of such refund and shall, within 30 days after receipt of such refund,
repay such refund to the Company with interest if any interest is received
thereon by such Bank or the Administrative Agent; provided that the Company,
upon the request of such Bank or the Administrative Agent, agrees to return
such refund (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Bank or the
Administrative Agent in the event such Bank or the Administrative Agent is
required to repay such refund.

(iv) (A) The Company shall reimburse or compensate each Bank
upon demand by such Bank, acting through the Administrative Agent, for all
costs incurred, losses suffered or payments made in connection with any CD Rate
Loans or Eurodollar Loans or any part thereof which costs, losses or payments
are a result of any present or future reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, liabilities of, deposits with or for the account
of, or Loans by such Bank imposed on such Bank, its foreign lending branch or
the interbank eurodollar market by any regulatory authority, central bank or
other governmental authority, whether or not having the force of law,
including, without limitation, Regulation D.

(B) If as a result of (y) the introduction of or any change
in or in the interpretation or administration of any law or regulation or (z)
the compliance with any request from any central bank or other governmental
authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase
in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
Loans for which such Bank shall not have been reimbursed pursuant to the
provisions of clause (A) above, then the Company shall from time to time, upon
demand by such Bank, acting through the Administrative Agent, pay to such Bank
additional amounts sufficient to indemnify such Bank against the full amount of
such increased cost.

(C) Any Bank claiming reimbursement or compensation under
this Section 2.01(g)(iv) shall make its demand on or before 45 days after the
end of each Interest Period during which any such cost is incurred, loss is
suffered or payment is made and shall provide the Administrative Agent, who in
turn shall provide the Company, with a written statement of the amount and
basis of its request, which statement, subject to Section 2.01(h), shall be
conclusive absent manifest error; provided that in the event any reimbursement
or compensation demanded by a Bank under this Section 2.01(g) is a result of
reserves actually maintained pursuant to the requirements imposed by Regulation
D with respect to "Eurocurrency liabilities" (as defined or within the meaning
of such Regulation), such demand shall be accompanied by a statement of such
Bank in the form of Exhibit 2.01(g)(iv) attached hereto. No Bank may request
reimbursement or compensation under this Section 2.01(g)(iv) for any period
prior to the period for which demand has been made in accordance with the
foregoing sentence. Such statement shall be conclusive and binding on the
Company, subject to Section 2.01(h), except in the case of manifest error. In
preparing any statement delivered under this Section 2.01(g)(iv), such Bank may
employ such assumptions and allocations of costs and expenses as it shall in
good faith deem reasonable and may be determined by any reasonable averaging
and attribution method. So long as any notice requirement provided for herein
has been satisfied, any decision by the Administrative Agent or any Bank not to
require payment of any interest, cost or other amount payable under this
Section 2.01(g)(iv), or to calculate any amount payable by



<PAGE>   34


27



a particular method, on any occasion, shall in no way limit or be deemed a
waiver of the Administrative Agent's or such Bank's right to require full
payment of any interest, cost or other amount payable hereunder, or to
calculate any amount payable by another method, on any other or subsequent
occasion for a subsequent Interest Period.

(v) If any Bank shall have determined in good faith that any
applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy now or
hereafter in effect, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any Bank (or any Lending Office of such Bank) with any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency has the
effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's capital or the capital of
any corporation Controlling such Bank as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Bank would have achieved as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's policies with respect to
capital adequacy) by an amount deemed in good faith by such Bank to be
material, then from time to time, upon notice by the Bank requesting (through
the Administrative Agent) compensation, under this Section 2.01(g)(v) within a
reasonable period of time after such Bank has obtained knowledge of such event,
the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such
reduction. Any such claim by a Bank for compensation shall be made through the
Administrative Agent and shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an
officer of such Bank authorized to so act on behalf of such Bank setting forth
the calculation upon which such claim is based.

(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company
is required to pay to any Bank amounts pursuant to Section 2.01(g)(iv)(A),
Section 2.01(g)(iv)(B) or Section 2.01(g)(v), the Company may give notice to
such Bank (with copies to the Administrative Agent) (A) that it wishes to seek
one or more assignees (which may be one or



<PAGE>   35


28



more of the Banks) to assume the Commitment of such Bank and to purchase its
outstanding Loans, in which case the Administrative Agent will use its best
efforts to assist the Company in obtaining an assignee, or (B) in the case of
any Bank that became a Bank pursuant to an assignment under Section 14.07, that
it wishes to terminate the Commitment of such Bank; provided that if more than
one Bank requests that the Company pay substantially and proportionately equal
additional amounts under Section 2.01(g)(iv)(A), Section 2.01(g)(iv)(B) or
Section 2.01(g)(v) and the Company elects to seek an assignee to assume, or to
terminate, the Commitments of any of such affected Banks, the Company must seek
an assignee or assignees to assume, or must terminate, as the case may be, the
Commitments of all of such affected Banks. Each Bank requesting compensation
pursuant to Section 2.01(g)(iv)(A), Section 2.01(g)(iv)(B) or Section
2.01(g)(v) agrees to sell its Commitment, its outstanding Loans and interest in
this Agreement in accordance with Section 14.07 to any such assignee for an
amount equal to the sum of, and agrees that its Commitment shall be terminated
as provided above upon payment to it by the Company of, the outstanding unpaid
principal of and accrued interest on its outstanding Loans in Dollars plus all
other fees and amounts (including, without limitation, any compensation claimed
by such Bank under Section 2.01(f), Section 2.01(g)(iv)(A), Section
2.01(g)(iv)(B) or Section 2.01(g)(v)) due such Bank hereunder calculated, in
each case, to the date such Commitment, Loans and interest are purchased or
such amounts are paid, as the case may be. Upon such sale or prepayment, each
such Bank shall have no further Commitment or other obligation to the Company
hereunder.

(vii) Any Bank claiming any amounts pursuant to this Section
2.01(g) shall use its reasonable good faith efforts (consistent with its
internal policies and legal and regulatory restrictions) to avoid or minimize
the payment by the Company of any amounts under this Section 2.01(g),
including, without limitation, changing the jurisdiction of its Lending Office;
provided that no such change or action shall be required to be made or taken
if, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, such change would be materially
disadvantageous to such Bank.

(viii) The aggregate amount payable, reimbursable or
compensable by the Company to or for the account of a



<PAGE>   36


29



Bank under this Section 2.01(g) shall not include any cost covered by the
amount received by such Bank from the Company through the Administrative Agent
in connection with the calculation of the CD Rate. The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent and each Bank harmless from and
against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in
the payment or omission to pay such amounts. The obligations of the Company
under this Section 2.01(g) created in accordance with this Section 2.01(g)
shall survive the termination of the Commitments, this Agreement and the
payment of the Obligations hereunder.

(h) Calculation Errors. Each calculation by the
Administrative Agent or any Bank with respect to amounts owing or to be owing
by the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any Loan shall be conclusive
except in the case of error. In the event the Administrative Agent determines
within a reasonable time that any such error shall have occurred in connection
with the determination of the applicable interest rate for any Loan which
results in the Company paying either more or less than the amount which would
have been due and payable but for such error, then (i) any Bank that received
an overpayment or underpayment or (ii) the Company, as the case may be, shall
promptly refund or pay, as the case may be, to the other any such overpayment
or underpayment. In the event it is determined within a reasonable time that
any Bank, acting through the Administrative Agent, has miscalculated any amount
for which it has demanded reimbursement or compensation from the Company in
respect of amounts owing by the Company other than interest which results in
the Company paying more or less than the amount which would have been due and
payable but for such error, such Bank or the Company, as the case may be, shall
promptly refund or pay, as the case may be, to the other the full amount of
such overpayment or underpayment. In the event it is determined within a
reasonable time that the Company has miscalculated the Commitment Fees due
under Section 4.02 which results in the Company paying more or less than the
amount which would have been due and payable but for such error, (y) any Bank
that received an overpayment or underpayment or (z) the Company, as the case
may be, shall promptly refund or pay, as the case may be, the full amount of
the overpayment or underpayment.

SECTION 2.02. Setoff, Counterclaims and Taxes. All payments
(whether of principal, interest, fees, reimbursements or otherwise) under this
Agreement shall be made by the Company without setoff or counterclaim and shall
be made free and clear of and without deduction (except as specifically
contemplated in Section 2.03 below) for any present or future tax, levy,
impost, or any other charge, if any, of any nature whatsoever now or hereafter
imposed by any governmental authority (including, without limitation,
withholdings of United States taxes, except as otherwise provided in Section
2.03). Except as specifically provided in Section 2.03 below, if the making of
such payments is prohibited by law unless such tax, levy, impost, or other
charge is deducted or withheld therefrom, the Company shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank, on the date of each such
payment, such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received by such Bank after such deduction or withholding shall equal
the amounts in Dollars which would have been received if such deduction or
withholding were not required. The Company shall confirm that all applicable
taxes, if any, imposed on this Agreement or transactions hereunder shall have
been properly and legally paid by it to the appropriate taxing authorities by
sending official tax receipts or notarized copies of such receipts to the
Administrative Agent within 30 calendar days after payment of any applicable
tax. Upon request of any Bank, the Administrative Agent shall forward to such
Bank a copy of such official receipt or a copy of such notarized copy of such
receipt.

SECTION 2.03. Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five
Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable
hereunder to the Banks, if any Bank is not incorporated or organized under the
laws of the United States of America, or a state thereof, such Bank agrees that
it will deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a duly
completed copy of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224,
certifying in either case that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under
this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States Federal
income taxes. If such Bank delivers a Form 1001 or 4224, such Bank further
undertakes to deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
an additional copy of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date
that such form



<PAGE>   38


31



expires (currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one
calendar year for Form 4224) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any
event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such
amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Company, in each case certifying that such Bank is entitled to
receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States Federal income taxes, unless an event (including, without
limitation, any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the
date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all
such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly completing
and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank advises the
Company (and the Administrative Agent) that it is not capable of receiving
payments without any deduction or withholding of United States Federal income
tax. In no event will any withholding by the Company of interest payable by any
Bank as contemplated by this Section 2.03 give rise to a Default under Section
10.01 with respect to payments of interest.

SECTION 2.04. Obligations Several, Not Joint. The obligations
of the Banks hereunder are several and not joint. The failure of any Bank to
make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any
other Bank of its obligation to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing,
and no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the
Loan to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing.

SECTION 2.05. Evidence of Debt. Any Bank may request that
Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Company
shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Bank a promissory note payable to
the order of such Bank (or, if requested by such Bank, to such Bank and its
registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon
shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 14.07) be
represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order
of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note,
to such payee and its registered assigns).

SECTION 2.06. Discretionary Loans. (a) Each Bank may, in its
sole discretion and on terms and conditions in writing satisfactory to it and
the Company that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement,
make additional Loans to the Company under its Commitment on any one or more
Business Days on or after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, which
Discretionary Loans will be payable to the appropriate Bank upon such terms and
conditions; provided, however, that the Company will not permit to remain
outstanding any Discretionary Loans from any Bank, and no Bank will make any
Discretionary Loans to the Company, if the aggregate principal amount of the
Discretionary Loans and the Revolving Loans made by such Bank exceeds such
Bank's Commitment. Should any Discretionary Loan be outstanding from any Bank
on a date on which a Borrowing is to be made, such Borrowing shall be made
available only if the Company has paid or shall simultaneously with the making
of such Borrowing pay such portions of Discretionary Loans (including, without
limitation, the payment of the amount of any losses payable pursuant to Section
2.01(f) actually incurred by such Bank as a result of such prepayment) as shall
be necessary to make available a portion of each Bank's Commitment at least
equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing. No Discretionary Loan
shall have a maturity date or interest period that extends beyond the Maturity
Date. Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account
or accounts evidencing the indebtedness to such Bank resulting from each
Discretionary Loan made by such Bank. The entries made in the accounts
maintained pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) shall be prima facie evidence of
the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided,
however, that the failure of any Bank to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay
the Discretionary Loans in accordance with their terms.

(b) Promptly upon written request of the Administrative
Agent, each Bank will certify in writing the borrowing date, the principal
amount and the maturity date of any Discretionary Loans made during any period
for which the Commitment Fees under Section 4.02 are to be calculated. The
Company agrees to certify to the Administrative Agent at the request of the
Administrative Agent on or before (i) each Borrowing and each




<PAGE>   40




33



Discretionary Borrowing, the borrowing date, the principal amount, the maturity
date and the lending Bank for each outstanding Discretionary Loan and (ii) each
Quarterly Date, the borrowing date, the principal amount, the maturity date and
the lending Bank for all Discretionary Loans made during any period for which
the Commitment Fees under Section 4.02 are to be calculated.

ARTICLE III

Optional and Required Prepayments; Interest

Payment Date; Other Payments

SECTION 3.01. Optional Prepayments. Loans may be prepaid in
whole or from time to time in part at the option of the Company on any Business
Day, without premium or penalty, notwithstanding that such Business Day is not
an Interest Payment Date, provided that:

(a) losses, if any, incurred by any Bank under Section
2.01(f) shall be payable with respect to each such prepayment of any such
Eurodollar Loan or CD Rate Loan; and

(b) all partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of at least $2,000,000 and an integral multiple of
$200,000; and

(c) the Company shall give the Administrative Agent not less
than one full Business Day's prior oral or written notice of each
prepayment of any Eurodollar Loans or CD Rate Loans, or any portion
thereof, and notice to the Administrative Agent not less than 9:00 a.m.
(Dallas, Texas time) on the same day of the prepayment of Alternate Base
Rate Loans, or any portion thereof, proposed to be made pursuant to this
Section 3.01, specifying the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be
prepaid and the prepayment date; provided, however, with respect to each
oral notice of a prepayment, the Company shall deliver promptly (and in
any event, no later than two Business Days after the giving of such oral
notice) to the Administrative Agent a confirmatory written notice of such
proposed prepayment. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Banks of the principal amount to be prepaid and the prepayment




<PAGE>   41


34


date. Notice of such prepayment shall be irrevocable and having been given
as aforesaid, the principal amount specified in such notice, together with
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of prepayment, shall
become due and payable on such prepayment date, and the provisions of
Section 2.01(f) shall be applicable. The Company shall have no optional
right to prepay the principal amount of any Loan other than as provided in
this Section 3.01.

SECTION 3.02. Required Prepayments. (a) If the Company shall
reduce or terminate the respective Commitments of the Banks pursuant to Section
4.03, it will prepay to each Bank on the effective date of any such reduction
or termination:

(i) in the case of a reduction of the Commitments, that part
of such unpaid principal amount outstanding of the Revolving Loans and the
Discretionary Loans held by such Bank that exceeds the amount of the
Commitment of such Bank immediately after such reduction; and

(ii) in the case of termination of the Commitments, the
entire unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Loans and the
Discretionary Loans, as applicable;

together, in each case, with accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being so
prepaid and all other amounts accrued and owing under this Agreement on such
date.

(b) As of any date on which the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary sells, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of any Property
(other than (i) dispositions of inventory in the ordinary course of business or
(ii) sales or transfers of Capital Stock or assets to the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary), if either (A) the ratio of Total Debt, as of the date
of the balance sheet most recently delivered pursuant to Section 8.02, to
EBITDA, for the four consecutive fiscal quarter period ended on the date of
such balance sheet, is in excess of 4.5 to 1.0 or (B) the Company is not in
compliance with its obligations under Section 8.02, then 50% of the Net Cash
Proceeds of such sale, assignment, transfer or disposition shall be immediately
applied to the




<PAGE>   42


35


prepayment of Loans under this Agreement, and the Commitments under this
Agreement shall be reduced by such amount so prepaid; provided that if in
connection with the disposition of any such Property the Company shall advise
the Administrative Agent that it intends to use the Net Cash Proceeds of such
disposition to acquire Cash Flow Producing Assets to be owned by the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary, then (i) the Commitments will not be reduced as
required by this Section 3.02(b) to the extent the amount prepaid or a portion
thereof shall have been reborrowed within 12 months after the date of such
disposition and used to acquire Cash Flow Producing Assets, and (ii) during
such 12 month period an amount of the Commitments equal to the amount so
prepaid will be restricted and the Company will be entitled to reborrow such
amount as provided herein only upon a certification to the Administrative Agent
that the proceeds of such borrowing will be promptly applied to acquire such
Cash Flow Producing Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such prepayment will
not be required in the event and for so long as such Net Cash Proceeds are held
by a "qualified intermediary" (as defined in ss. 1.103(k)- 1(g)(4)(iii) of
Title 26 of the Code of Federal Regulations) pursuant to a like kind exchange
as provided for by ss. 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; provided,
however, that this sentence shall in no way limit or otherwise affect the
Company's obligations under this Section 3.02(b) to reduce the Commitments by
50% of such Net Cash Proceeds in the event the notice and reinvestment
provisions set forth above are not complied with.

(c) As of any date on which the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary on a consolidated basis incurs Debt other than Debt incurred under
this Agreement, if either (i) the ratio of Total Debt, as of the date of the
balance sheet most recently delivered pursuant to Section 8.02 on a pro forma
basis giving effect to such incurrence and any use of the proceeds thereof to
repay Debt reflected on such balance sheet, to EBITDA, for the four consecutive
fiscal quarter period ended on the date of such balance sheet, is in excess of
4.5 to 1.0, or (ii) the Company is not in compliance with its obligations under
Section 8.02, then 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt shall be
immediately applied to the prepayment of Loans under this Agreement, and the
Commitments under this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount so prepaid
except to the extent that after such application the ratio of (i) Total Debt as




<PAGE>   43


36


of such balance sheet date minus such amount of Net Cash Proceeds to (ii)
EBITDA for such four consecutive fiscal periods would be less than 4.5 to 1.0;
provided, however, that prepayments and reductions required under this Section
3.02(c) shall be made only at such time as the aggregate amount of payments and
reductions required but not made shall equal an amount not less than
$20,000,000, at which time Loans shall be prepaid and Commitments reduced in
such aggregate amount.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no prepayment shall be
required under Section 3.02(b) with respect to an aggregate of $10,000,000 of
Net Cash Proceeds and (ii) in the event any prepayment required by Section
3.02(b) to be made under this Agreement shall be in an amount less than
$2,000,000, such prepayment may be deferred until the aggregate amount of the
prepayments deferred in reliance on this provision shall exceed $2,000,000, at
which time all such prepayments shall be promptly made and the Commitments
correspondingly reduced. In the event any prepayment required by Section
3.02(b) or (c) with respect to any Loan would become due on a date that is not
an Interest Payment Date and as a result thereof the Company would incur
liabilities under Section 2.01(f), then (A) if the next Interest Payment Date
for such Loan would occur within 90 days of the date on which such prepayment
is otherwise due, such prepayment may be made on such Interest Payment Date and
(B) if the next Interest Payment Date for such Loan would not occur within 90
days of such date on which such prepayment is due, the Company shall make such
prepayment to the Administrative Agent on the due date; provided, however, that
interest shall continue to accrue on any Loan so prepaid and shall be paid by
the Company to the Administrative Agent on the applicable Interest Payment
Date, and, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall occur or shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent shall hold the proceeds of
such prepayment for the benefit of the Banks, in an interest bearing account,
until such time as such proceeds can be applied towards payment of the Loans in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement without resulting in any
liability to the Company under Section 2.01(f). All interest which may accrue
on such amounts so held in escrow shall be held by the Administrative Agent for
the benefit of the Company.




<PAGE>   44


37

(e) All prepayments made pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3.02 shall be applied, first, towards payment of all Alternate Base
Rate Loans, as the Company directs, and secondly, and subject to the provisions
of Section 2.01(f), towards payment of the appropriate amount of CD Rate Loans
and Eurodollar Loans, as the Company directs.

SECTION 3.03. Interest Payment Date. The Company shall repay
the principal amount of each Loan on the Interest Payment Date for such Loan,
or if earlier, the Maturity Date; provided that the Company may reborrow in
accordance with Section 2.01(a) or Section 2.06 for the purpose of refinancing
any Loan made thereunder. All principal payments of Loans shall be accompanied
by accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being repaid to the date
of payment.

SECTION 3.04. Place, Etc. of Payments and Prepayments. All
payments and prepayments made in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of the Commitment Fees and the Administrative Agent's fee
and of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans shall be made to the
Administrative Agent in Dollars at its office at 2200 Ross Avenue, Dallas,
Texas 75201, in immediately available funds for the accounts of the Banks. The
Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to the Banks, in accordance with
each Bank's Pro Rata Share in immediately available funds, the amount of
principal, interest and Commitment Fees received by the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Banks, taking into account the effect of any
Discretionary Loans; provided that if interest shall accrue on any Loan at a
rate different from the rate applicable to any other Loan, payment and
distribution of interest shall be based on the respective accrual rates
applicable to such Loan. Any payment to the Administrative Agent for the
account of a Bank under this Agreement shall constitute payment by the Company
to such Bank of the amounts so paid to the Administrative Agent, and any Loan
or portions thereof so paid shall not be considered outstanding for any purpose
after the date of such payment to the Administrative Agent.

ARTICLE IV

Fees; Reduction of Commitments

SECTION 4.01. Administration Fee. Until payment in full of
the Obligations and termination of the Commitments hereunder, the Company
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent an administration fee pursuant to the
terms and conditions set forth in the TCB Fee Letter.

SECTION 4.02. Commitment Fees. The Company agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank in Dollars, Commitment
Fees, computed on a daily basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, from the date of this Agreement to and including the Maturity Date at a
rate per annum equal to the applicable Margin Percentage from time to time in
effect on the daily average unused amount of the Commitment of such Bank
(taking into account all Revolving Loans and Discretionary Loans of such Bank
outstanding on the dates covered by such calculation). Each such Commitment Fee
shall be payable on or before the fifteenth day following each Quarterly Date
and on the Maturity Date or on such earlier date as the Commitment of such Bank
shall terminate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 4.03. Reduction or Termination of Commitments. The
Company may at any time or from time to time reduce ratably in proportion to
their respective Commitments or terminate in whole, the respective Commitments
of the Banks hereunder by giving not less than three full Business Days' prior
written notice to such effect to the Administrative Agent; provided that any
partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000
and an integral multiple of $1,000,000; provided, further, that the Commitments
may not be reduced to an amount less than the aggregate principal amount of
Discretionary Loans and Revolving Loans outstanding at such time, unless
simultaneously therewith the Company shall make a prepayment in accordance with
Section 3.02(a) hereof. In the event of any prepayment of the Loans outstanding
hereunder pursuant to Section 3.02(b) or (c), the Commitments shall be ratably
reduced by the amount of such prepayment to the extent provided in Section
3.02(b) or (c). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of its
Pro Rata Share of and of




<PAGE>   46


39


the date of each reduction of the Commitments. After each such reduction, the
Commitment Fees owing to each Bank shall be calculated upon the Commitment of
such Bank as so reduced. In the event of acceleration of the date on which any
Loan is payable in accordance with Article X, the Commitments hereunder of the
Banks shall thereupon automatically terminate without notice. Each reduction or
any termination of the Commitments, and each notice thereof, under this
Agreement shall be irrevocable.

ARTICLE V

Application of Proceeds

The Company agrees that the proceeds of the Loans hereunder
shall be used by the Company in accordance with the introductory statement to
this Agreement.

ARTICLE VI

Representations and Warranties

The Company represents and warrants that:

SECTION 6.01. Organization; Qualification; Subsidiaries. The
Company and each Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, (b) has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry
on its business as now conducted, and (c) is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation to do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction where

upon its independent review of the facts and circumstances of the Company in

indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company,

Administrative Agent may resign at any time as Administrative Agent under this
Agreement, by giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to the Banks and the

the Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a
commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of
any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least

under this Agreement by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent's
resignation or removal as Administrative Agent under this Agreement, the
provisions of this Article XII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.

Guarantee

In order to induce the Banks to extend credit hereunder, each
Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees (except to the extent, and only for
so long as, any such Guarantor is prohibited from doing so by the terms of any
Debt obligation existing as of January 31, 1997 and outstanding on the Closing
Date), jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor
and not




<PAGE>   78


71


merely as a surety, the Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that the
Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to

and protest to the Company of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of
acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The
obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the
failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to assert any claim or demand
or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company under the provisions of
this Agreement or otherwise, (b) any rescission, waiver, amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or any other
agreement, (c) the failure of any Bank to exercise any right or remedy against
the Company or (d) any release of any other Guarantor.

Each Guarantor further agrees that its agreement hereunder
constitutes a promise of payment when due and not merely of collection, and
waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Bank to any balance
of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Bank in favor of the
Company or any other Person.

The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be
subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason,
and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or
termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of
the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired
or otherwise affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to
assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Agreement or
under any other agreement, by any waiver or modification in respect of any
thereof, by any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the
performance of the Obligations, or by any other act or omission which may or
might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or




<PAGE>   79


72

otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or
equity.

Each Guarantor further agrees that its obligations hereunder
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any
Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative
Agent or any Bank upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or
otherwise.

In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any
other right which the Administrative Agent or any Bank may have at law or in
equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company
to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each
Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the
Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash the amount of
such unpaid Obligation.

Upon payment by any Guarantor of any Obligations, each Bank
shall, in a reasonable manner, assign the amount of the Obligations owed to it
and so paid to such Guarantor, such assignment to be pro tanto to the extent to
which the Obligations in question were discharged by such Guarantor, or make
such disposition thereof as such Guarantor shall direct (all without recourse
to and without any representation or warranty by any Bank).

Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided above,
all rights of such Guarantor against the Company or any other Guarantor arising
as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise (including the
rights of such Guarantor under the previous and the next paragraphs) shall in
all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior
indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations to the Banks.

In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation
as the Guarantors may have under applicable law, the Company agrees that in the
event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under its Guarantee, the Company
shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such
Guarantor shall be subrogated to the




<PAGE>   80


73


rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of
such payment. Each Guarantor agrees that in the event a payment shall be made
by any Guarantor under its Guarantee, and such Guarantor (the "Claiming
Guarantor") shall not have been indemnified by the Company as provided in the
preceding sentence, each other Guarantor (a "Contributing Guarantor") shall
indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such
payment multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth
of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof (or any later date on which it
shall have become a Guarantor) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net
worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, as to any Guarantor, on any
later date on which it shall have become a Guarantor).

ARTICLE XIV

Miscellaneous

SECTION 14.01. Payment of Expenses. Any provision hereof to
the contrary notwithstanding, and whether or not the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be consummated, the Company agrees to pay on demand (i)
all reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Banks or
any Bank in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and all amendments hereto (including, without limitation, waivers
hereunder and workouts with respect to Loans hereunder) and the other
instruments and documents to be delivered hereunder or with respect to any
amendment hereto, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
out-of-pocket expenses of any counsel for the Administrative Agent and the
Banks or any Bank with respect thereto; provided, however, that so long as no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such reasonable
counsel expenses shall be limited to the reasonable expenses of one counsel for
the Administrative Agent, (ii) all reasonable increases in costs and expenses
of the Administrative Agent and the Banks or any Bank (including reasonable
counsel fees and expenses, including reasonable allocated costs of in-house
legal counsel to the Administrative Agent or any Bank), if any, in connection
with the administration of this Agreement after the occurrence of a Default or
Event of Default and so long as




<PAGE>   81


74


the same is continuing and (iii) all reasonable costs and expenses of the
Administrative Agent and the Banks or any Bank (including reasonable counsel
fees and expenses, including reasonable allocated costs of in-house legal
counsel to the Administrative Agent or any Bank), if any, in connection with
the enforcement of this Agreement and the other instruments and documents to be
delivered hereunder. The obligations of the Company under this Section 14.01
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the
obligations hereunder.

SECTION 14.02. Notices. The Administrative Agent or any Bank
giving consent or notice to the Company or any Guarantor provided for hereunder
(other than in connection with any Discretionary Loans) shall notify each Bank
and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the event that any Bank shall transfer
any Loan in accordance with Section 14.07(c), it shall immediately so advise
the Administrative Agent which shall be entitled to assume conclusively that no
transfer of any Loan has been made by any Bank unless and until the
Administrative Agent receives written notice to the contrary. Except as
otherwise specifically permitted by this Agreement with respect to oral Notices
of Borrowing or oral notices regarding the payment of interest under Section
10.01, notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing
(including telegraphic, facsimile or cable communication) and shall be
delivered, mailed, telegraphed, transmitted or cabled addressed to the
addresses set forth on Exhibit 14.02 attached hereto (or, as to the Company,
any Guarantor or the Administrative Agent, at such other address as shall be
designated by such party to the other parties in a written notice to the other
parties and, as to each other party, at such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice to the Company and the
Administrative Agent). All notices and other communications given to any party
hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been given upon receipt or if sent by registered or certified mail four
Business Days after being duly posted, in each case addressed to such party as
provided in this Section 14.02 or in accordance with the latest unrevoked
direction from such party, except for Notices of Borrowing and notices of
prepayments of Loans hereunder, which shall be deemed to have been given when
received by the Administrative Agent, and except for notices from the




<PAGE>   82


75


Administrative Agent to the Company under Section 10.01 with respect to the
amount of accrued and unpaid interest due on the Loans, which shall be deemed
to have been given when received by the Company. The Administrative Agent and
the Banks may at any time waive any requirement for notice hereunder.

SECTION 14.03. Setoff. If one or more Events of Default as
defined herein shall occur, any Bank or commercial bank which is owed any
obligation hereunder (a "Depositary") shall have the right, in addition to all
other rights and remedies available to it, and is hereby authorized, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, at any time and from time to time, without
notice to the Company (any such notice being hereby expressly waived by the
Company), to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness (whether
or not then due and payable) at any time owing by the Depositary to or for the
credit or the account of the Company or any Guarantor, against any and all of
the Obligations of the Company or any Guarantor now or hereafter existing under
this Agreement irrespective of whether or not the Depositary shall have made
any demand for satisfaction of such Obligations and although such Obligations
may be unmatured. Each Depositary agrees to notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
setoff and application. The rights of each Depositary under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other
rights of setoff which such Depositary may have hereunder or under any
applicable law). Each Depositary agrees that (i) if it shall exercise any such
right of banker's lien, setoff, counterclaim or similar right pursuant hereto,
it will apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of Loans outstanding
hereunder and (ii) if it shall through the exercise of a right of banker's
lien, setoff, counterclaim or otherwise obtain payment of a proportion of the
Loans held by it in excess of the proportion of the Loans of each of the other
Depositaries being paid simultaneously, it shall be deemed to have
simultaneously purchased from each other Depositary a participation in the
Loans owed to such other Depositaries so that the amount of unpaid Loans and
participations therein held by all Depositaries shall be




<PAGE>   83


76


proportionate to the original principal amount of the Loans owed to them, and
in each case it shall promptly remit to each such Depositary the amount of the
participation thus deemed to have been purchased. The Company expressly
consents to the foregoing arrangements, and in furtherance thereof, agrees that
at such time as an Event of Default hereunder has occurred, the Administrative
Agent shall provide to each Bank a schedule setting forth the Commitment of
each Bank hereunder to permit each Bank to correctly determine the portion
which its Commitment hereunder bears to the aggregate of all Commitments
hereunder. If all or any portion of any such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from the Depositary which received the same, the purchase provided
for herein shall be deemed to have been rescinded to the extent of such
recovery, without interest.

SECTION 14.04. Indemnity and Judgments. The Company agrees to
indemnify the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, advisors,
Controlling Persons and Affiliates from and hold each harmless against any and
all losses, costs, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by any of
the foregoing Persons (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, settlement costs, court costs
and other legal expenses, arising out of or by reason of any participation in,
or any action or omission in connection with this Agreement (and, with respect
to TCB, Chase Securities Inc., NationsBank of Texas, N.A., NationsBanc Capital
Markets, Inc., Citibank, N.A. and Citicorp Securities, Inc. and their officers,
directors, employees and Affiliates, any action or omission in connection with
the Commitment Letter dated as of February 5, 1997 (the "Commitment Letter") by
and among the Company and such parties) or any Loan by a Bank hereunder or any
investigation, litigation or other proceedings brought or threatened relating
thereto, or to any use or proposed use to be made by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Loans and to the extent that the Indemnified Liabilities
arise out of or by reason of claims made by Persons other than the
Administrative Agent or any Bank; provided that no such Person shall be
entitled to be indemnified and held harmless against any such Indemnified
Liabilities arising out of or by reason of the gross negligence or wilful




<PAGE>   84


77


misconduct of such Person. The parties acknowledge that the indemnification
provisions set forth in the Commitment Letter shall be superseded by this
Section 14.04.

SECTION 14.05. Interest. Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall never be required to pay unearned
interest on any Loan and shall never be required to pay interest on any Loan at
a rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, and if the effective rate of
interest which would otherwise be payable under this Agreement would exceed the
Highest Lawful Rate, or if any Bank shall receive any unearned interest or
shall receive monies that are deemed to constitute interest which would
increase the effective rate of interest payable under this Agreement to a rate
in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then (i) in lieu of the amount of
interest which would otherwise be payable under this Agreement, the Company
shall pay the Highest Lawful Rate, and (ii) any unearned interest paid by the
Company or any interest paid by the Company in excess of the Highest Lawful
Rate shall be credited on the principal of such Loan, and, thereafter, refunded
to the Company. It is further agreed that, without limitation of the foregoing,
all calculations of the rate of interest contracted for, charged or received by
any Bank under this Agreement that are made for the purpose of determining
whether such rate exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Bank (such
Highest Lawful Rate being such Bank's "Maximum Permissible Rate"), shall be
made, to the extent permitted by usury laws applicable to such Bank (now or
hereafter enacted), by amortizing, prorating and spreading in equal parts
during the period of the full stated term of the Loans all interest at any time
contracted for, charged or received by such Bank in connection therewith. If at
any time and from time to time (y) the amount of interest payable to any Bank
on any date shall be computed at such Bank's Maximum Permissible Rate pursuant
to this Section 14.05 and (z) in respect of any subsequent interest computation
period the amount of interest otherwise payable to such Bank would be less than
the amount of interest payable to such Bank computed at such Bank's Maximum
Permissible Rate, then the amount of interest payable to such Bank in respect
of such subsequent interest computation period shall continue to be computed at
such Bank's Maximum Permissible Rate until the total amount of interest payable
to such Bank shall equal the total amount




<PAGE>   85


78


of interest which would have been payable to such Bank if the total amount of
interest had been computed without giving effect to this Section.

SECTION 14.06. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction;
Venue. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND OTHER DOCUMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS EXECUTED BY THE COMPANY, THE
GUARANTORS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE BANKS UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK AND OF THE UNITED STATES AND FOR ALL PURPOSES SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, AND GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS OF SAID STATE AND OF THE UNITED
STATES. Without limitation of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver of any rights which any Bank may have under
applicable Federal law relating to the amount of interest which such Bank may
contract for, take, receive or charge in respect of any Loans, including any
right to take, receive, reserve and charge interest at the rate allowed by the
laws of the state where such Bank is located. To the extent that Texas law is
applicable to the determination of the Highest Lawful Rate or a Maximum
Permissible Rate, the provisions of Chapter 15 of Subtitle 3, Title 79, of the
Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, shall not apply to this
Agreement. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement may be
brought in the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York City or of
the United States for the Southern District of New York, and by execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby
irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each
of the Company and the Guarantors further irrevocably consents to the service
of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, to either the Company or the respective Guarantor at its
address for notices pursuant to Section 14.02, such service to become effective
15 days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the
Administrative Agent or any Bank to serve process in any other manner permitted
by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against the
Company or any Guarantor in any other jurisdiction.




<PAGE>   86


79


(b) Each of the Company and the Guarantors irrevocably waives
any objection which it may now or here after have to the laying of venue of any
of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement brought in the courts referred to in clause (a) above and hereby
further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

SECTION 14.07. Survival of Representations and Warranties;
Binding Effect; Assignment. (a) All representations, warranties and covenants
contained herein or made in writing by the Company or any Guarantor in
connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and will bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns
of the parties hereto, whether so expressed or not. This Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Company, the Guarantors, the
Administrative Agent and each of the Banks, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Guarantors, the
Administrative Agent and the Banks and their respective successors and assigns,
except that neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall have the right to
assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of each Bank.

(b) Each Bank may grant participations to one or more other
banks or other Persons in or to all or any part of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
Commitment) pursuant to such participation agreements and certificates as are
customary in the banking industry; provided, however, that (i) such Bank's
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation its Commitment
to the Company hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations and (iii) the Company, the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and
the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in
connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement,
including without limitation, such Bank's rights under Article XI hereof. In
connection with any such




<PAGE>   87


80


participation, each Bank may deliver such financial information concerning the
Company and its Subsidiaries to permit such participant to make an informed and
independent credit decision concerning such participation; provided, however,
each such Bank shall obtain from each such participant an agreement to the
effect that all such information delivered to it in connection with such
participation shall be considered confidential and shall not be further
distributed or delivered to any other Person except any regulatory body having
jurisdiction over such participant or to any director, officer, employee,
Affiliate or representative (including accountants and attorneys acting for
such participants) or as may otherwise be required by legal process or
applicable law, rules and regulations. Upon request of the Company, each Bank
shall give prompt notice to the Company of each such participation to banks or
other Persons that are not Affiliates of such Bank identifying each such
participant and the interest acquired by each such participant. This Agreement
shall not be construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person,
including, without limitation, any Person acquiring a participation in any
Loan, other than the parties to this Agreement, except that any Person
acquiring a participation shall be entitled to the benefits conferred upon the
Banks by Section 2.01(f)-(g) (provided that the cost to the Company is not in
excess of what such cost would have been had such participation not been
granted).

(c) Subject (except in the case of assignments to Affiliates
of the Banks) to the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) and the Administrative Agent, each Bank may
assign to a bank or other Person a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including, without limitation, a portion of its Commitment);
provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and
not a varying, percentage of all of the assigning Bank's rights and obligations
under this Agreement and shall be in an amount equal to or greater than
$5,000,000 of the assigning Bank's Commitment (except in the case of
assignments to Affiliates of any Bank or unless otherwise agreed by the
Company) and (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register,
an Assignment and Acceptance in




<PAGE>   88


81


substantially the form of Exhibit 14.07(c) attached hereto (the "Assignment and
Acceptance"), together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;
provided, however, that such recordation fee shall not be payable if such
transfer is made pursuant to Sections 2.01(e) or (g)(vi). Upon such execution,
delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date shall be the date on
which such Assignment and Acceptance is accepted by the Administrative Agent,
(x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank under this
Agreement and (y) the Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
all or the remaining portion of an assigning Bank's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

(d) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the Bank assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Bank makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
thereto, (ii) such assigning Bank makes no representation or warranty and
assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the
Company or the performance or observance by the Company of any of its
respective obligations under this Agreement, (iii) such assignee confirms that
it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial
statements referred to in Sections 6.02 and 8.02 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance, (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such




<PAGE>   89


82



assigning Bank or any other Bank and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, (v) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action
as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and (vi) such assignee agrees that
it will perform in accordance with its terms all of the obligations which by
the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank.

(e) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 14.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Banks and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans
owing to, each Bank from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error, and the Company, the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and the Banks
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Bank
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by the Company or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(f) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Bank, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and
Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit
14.07(c) attached hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii)
record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt
notice thereof to the Company.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
any Bank may at any time, without the consent of the Company, assign all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Loans) in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; provided that no such
assignment shall




<PAGE>   90


83



release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
Federal Reserve Bank for such Bank as a party hereto. In order to facilitate
such an assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, the Company shall, at the request
of the assigning Bank, duly execute and deliver to the assigning Bank a
promissory note or notes evidencing the Loans made to the Company by the
assigning Bank hereunder.

SECTION 14.08. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in several counterparts, and by the parties hereto on separate counterparts.
When counterparts executed by all the parties shall have been delivered to the
Administrative Agent, this Agreement shall become effective, and at such time
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and each Bank. Each
counterpart, when so executed and delivered, shall constitute an original
instrument, and all such separate counterparts shall constitute but one and the
same instrument.

SECTION 14.09. Severability. Should any clause, sentence,
paragraph or section of this Agreement be judicially declared to be invalid,
unenforceable or void, such decision will not have the effect of invalidating
or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, and the parties hereto agree that
the part or parts of this Agreement so held to be invalid, unenforceable or
void will be deemed to have been stricken herefrom and the remainder will have
the same force and effectiveness as if such part or parts had never been
included herein.

SECTION 14.10. Descriptive Headings. The section headings in
this Agreement have been inserted for convenience only and shall be given no
substantive meaning or significance whatever in construing the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

SECTION 14.11. Representation of the Banks. Each Bank hereby
represents and warrants that it is not relying upon any Margin Stock as
collateral in extending or maintaining the credit to the Company represented by
this Agreement.

SECTION 14.12. Final Agreement of the Parties. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto) represents the final agreement between the
parties and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or




<PAGE>   91


84


subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no oral agreements between
the parties.

SECTION 14.13. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE COMPANY AND EACH
GUARANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM
THEREIN.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF this Agreement has been executed by the
duty authorized signatories of the parties hereto in several counterparts all
as of the day and year first above written.

2.      TERM CREDIT-A

2.1     Bank agrees to loan to Company and Company agrees to borrow,
on the date of execution of this Agreement, the sum of Three Million Five
Hundred Seventy One Thousand Four Hundred Twenty Eight and 56/100 Dollars
($3,571,428.56). At the time of borrowing, Company agrees to execute a term
note in form similar to that





3
<PAGE>   5

annexed hereto as Exhibit "C" as evidence of the indebtedness hereunder (herein
called "Term Note-A"). The loan under this Section 2 shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2.2     The indebtedness represented by the Term Note-A shall be
repaid in quarterly principal installments of One Hundred Seventy Eight
Thousand Five Hundred Seventy One and 43/100 Dollars ($178,571.43) each, plus
interest as set forth below, commencing on January 1, 1998, and on the 1st day
of each succeeding calendar quarter, until November 1, 2002, when the entire
unpaid balance of principal and interest thereon shall be due and payable.
Company agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Term
Note-A from time to time outstanding at a per annum rate of eight and nineteen
one hundredths percent (8.19%). Upon the occurrence of any default or event of
default hereunder, interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance at a
per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) eleven and nineteen one hundredths
percent (11.19%) and three percent (3%) above Bank's Prime Rate. Interest shall
be computed on a daily basis using a year of 360 days and assessed for the
actual number of days elapsed, and in such computation effect shall be given to
any change in the interest rate resulting from a change in the Prime Rate on
the date of such change in the Prime Rate. "Prime Rate" shall mean the rate of
interest established by Bank as its prime rate as the same may be changed from
time to time, which may not necessarily be Bank's lowest rate for loans.

A late installment charge equal to five percent (5%) of each late
installment may be charged on any installment payment not received by Bank
within ten (10) calendar days after the installment due date but acceptance of
this charge shall not waive any default or event of default under this
Agreement.

2.3     All partial prepayments with respect to the Term Note-A shall
be applied to the Term Note-A in the inverse order of their respective
maturities. The Term Note-A may be prepaid on any principal installment payment
date upon five (5) days written notice to Bank, in whole or in part (in amounts
of at least $100,000) upon payment of a premium equal to the sum of the
discounted net present values of the interest payments that would otherwise be
payable on the principal amount being prepaid, after reducing each such
interest payment by the amount of the interest that would be payable on each
interest payment due date if the





4
<PAGE>   6

principal amount being prepaid were re-invested at the Current Market Rate
therefor plus $500. For these purposes, "Current Market Rate" shall mean a per
annum interest rate equal to one half percent (1/2%) above the rate reasonably
determined by Bank (based on quotations from established dealers) to be in
effect approximately two days prior to the repayment date in the secondary
market for United States Treasury securities of a comparable amount and with a
comparable term to maturity as the principal amount being prepaid. For the
purposes of computation, the discount rate for each computation will be the
Current Market Rate for the relevant principal installment. Upon any
involuntary prepayment of the Term Note-A, Company shall pay to Bank a
prepayment premium equal to the prepayment premium which would be due and
payable hereunder if Company had voluntarily elected to prepay the Term Note-A
(in an amount equal to such involuntary prepayment) on such date of involuntary
prepayment.

2.4     The proceeds of the Term Note-A shall be used solely to fund a
portion of the purchase price payable by Company under the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of October 31, 1997 by and among Company and the
shareholders of Central Engineering Company ("Stock Purchase Agreement") and to
refinance Company's existing term debt with Bank.

3.      TERM CREDIT-B

3.1     Bank agrees to loan to Company and Company agrees to borrow,
on the date of execution of this Agreement, the sum of Four Million Dollars
($4,000,000). At the time of borrowing, Company agrees to execute a term note
in form similar to that annexed hereto as Exhibit "D" as evidence of the
indebtedness hereunder (herein called "Term Note-B"). The loan under this
Section 3 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

3.2     The indebtedness represented by the Term Note-B shall be
repaid in quarterly principal and interest installments of One Hundred Eighteen
Thousand Six Hundred Twenty Four and 08/100 Dollars ($118,624.08) each,
commencing on January 1, 1998, and on the 1st day of each succeeding calendar
quarter, until November 1, 2002, when the entire unpaid balance of principal
and interest thereon shall be due and payable. Company agrees to pay interest
on the unpaid principal balance of the Term Note-B from time to time
outstanding at a per annum rate of one half percent (1/2%) below





5
<PAGE>   7

Bank's Prime Rate. Interest shall be payable quarterly on the 1st day of each
calendar quarter commencing January 1, 1998. Upon the occurrence of any default
or event of default hereunder, interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal
balance at a per annum rate equal to two and one half percent (2-1/2%) above
the Prime Rate. Interest shall be computed on a daily basis using a year of 360
days and assessed for the actual number of days elapsed, and in such
computation effect shall be given to any change in the interest rate resulting
from a change in the Prime Rate on the date of such change in the Prime Rate.

The installment payments are calculated at an assumed fixed interest
rate and an assumed fifteen year amortization term. In the event the Bank's
prime rate changes, the Bank, at its sole option, may from time to time
recalculate the period installment amount so that the remaining periodic
installments will fully amortize the remaining loan balance within the
remaining amortization term in equal installments at the interest rate then
being charged under Term Note-B. COMPANY AGREES TO PAY THE PERIODIC
INSTALLMENTS AS THEY MAY BE RECALCULATED BY THE BANK, AT THE BANK'S SOLE
OPTION, FROM TIME TO TIME AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT A RECALCULATION SHALL NOT
AFFECT THE MATURITY DATE OR THE OTHER TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF TERM NOTE-B.

A late installment charge equal to five percent (5%) of each late
installment may be charged on any installment payment not received by Bank
within ten (10) calendar days after the installment due date but acceptance of
this charge shall not waive any default or event of default under this
Agreement.

3.3     Company may prepay the Term Note-B in whole or in part without
premium or penalty.

3.4     The proceeds of the Term Note-B shall be used solely to fund a
portion of the purchase price payable by Company under the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement.

4.      TERM CREDIT-C

4.1     Bank agrees to loan to Company and Company agrees to borrow,
on the date of execution of this Agreement, the sum of Three Million Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,250,000). At the time of borrowing, Company
agrees to execute a term note in





6
<PAGE>   8

form similar to that annexed hereto as Exhibit "E" as evidence of the
indebtedness hereunder (herein called "Term Note-C and together with the Line
Note, Term Note-A and Term Note-B, the "Notes"). The loan under this Section 4
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

4.2     The indebtedness represented by the Term Note-C shall be
repaid in quarterly principal installments of Two Hundred Seventy Thousand
Eight Hundred Thirty Three and 33/100 Dollars ($270,833.33) each, plus interest
as set forth below, commencing on January 1, 1998, and on the 1st day of each
succeeding calendar quarter, until November 1, 2000, when the entire unpaid
balance of principal and interest thereon shall be due and payable. Company
agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Term Note-C from
time to time outstanding at a per annum rate of eight and six one hundredths
percent (8.06%) until November 1, 1999 when the interest rate shall be a per
annum rate equal to one half of one percent (1/2%) below Bank's Prime Rate.
Upon the occurrence of any default or event of default hereunder, interest
shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance at a per annum rate equal to the
greater of (i) eleven and six one hundredths percent (11.06%) and three percent
(3%) above Bank's Prime Rate. Interest shall be computed on a daily basis using
a year of 360 days and assessed for the actual number of days elapsed, and in
such computation effect shall be given to any change in the interest rate
resulting from a change in the Prime Rate on the date of such change in the
Prime Rate.

A late installment charge equal to five percent (5%) of each late
installment may be charged on any installment payment not received by Bank
within ten (10) calendar days after the installment due date but acceptance of
this charge shall not waive any default or event of default under this
Agreement.

4.3     All partial prepayments with respect to the Term Note-C shall
be applied to the Term Note-A in the inverse order of their respective
maturities. While the interest rate is a fixed rate, the Term Note-C may be
prepaid on any principal installment payment date upon five (5) days written
notice to Bank, in whole or in part (in amounts of at least $100,000) upon
payment of a premium equal to the sum of the discounted net present values of
the interest payments that would otherwise be payable on the principal amount
being prepaid, after reducing each such interest payment by the





7
<PAGE>   9

amount of the interest that would be payable on each interest payment due date
if the principal amount being prepaid were re-invested at the Current Market
Rate therefor plus $500. For these purposes, "Current Market Rate" shall mean a
per annum interest rate equal to one half percent (1/2degrees/0) above the rate
reasonably determined by Bank (based on quotations from established dealers) to
be in effect approximately two days prior to the repayment date in the
secondary market for United States Treasury securities of a comparable amount
and with a comparable term to maturity as the principal amount being prepaid.
For the purposes of computation, the discount rate for each computation will be
the Current Market Rate for the relevant principal installment. Upon any
involuntary prepayment of the Term Note-C, Company shall pay to Bank a
prepayment premium equal to the prepayment premium which would be due and
payable hereunder if Company had voluntarily elected to prepay the Term Note-C
(in an amount equal to such involuntary prepayment) on such date of involuntary
prepayment. At all times when the interest rate is a floating rate, the Term
Note-C may be prepaid in the manner set forth in Section 3.3.

4.4     The proceeds of the Term Note-C shall be used solely to fund a
portion of the purchase price payable by Company under the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement.

5.      INTEREST RATE REDUCTION.

5.1     The interest rates with respect to the Line Note and any other
Note which bears interest at a floating rate shall be reduced by one quarter of

LINE OF CREDIT NOTE
(Eurodollar Rate)


$9,000,000                                                     Detroit, Michigan
October 31, 1997



On or before April 1, 1999 (herein called the "Maturity Date"), FOR
VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Cade Industries, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation
(herein called "Borrower"), promises to pay to the order of BANK, a Michigan
banking corporation (herein called "Bank"), in lawful currency of the United
States of America, the principal sum of NINE MILLION DOLLARS ($9,000,000), or
so much of said sum as has been advanced and is then outstanding under this
Note, together with interest thereon as hereinafter set forth.

This Note is a note under which Advances, repayments and re-Advances
may be made from time to time, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Note; provided, however, in no event shall Bank be obligated to make any
Advances or re-Advances hereunder (notwithstanding anything expressed or
implied herein or elsewhere to the contrary).

Each of the Advances made hereunder shall bear interest at the
Eurodollar-based Rate or the Prime-based Rate, as elected by Borrower or as
otherwise determined under this Note.

Accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid balance of each outstanding
Prime-based Advance shall be payable quarterly, in arrears, commencing on
January 1, 1998, and on the first Business Day of each succeeding quarter
thereafter, until maturity (whether as stated herein, by acceleration, or
otherwise). Interest accruing at the Prime-based Rate shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days, and shall be assessed for the actual number of
days





<PAGE>   33

elapsed, and in such computation, effect shall be given to any change in the
Applicable Interest Rate as a result of any change in the Prime-based Rate on
the date of each such change in the Prime-based Rate.

Accrued and unpaid interest on each Eurodollar-based Advance shall be
payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (unless
sooner accelerated in accordance with the terms of this Note). Interest
accruing at the Eurodollar-based Rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360
day year and shall be assessed for the actual number of days elapsed from the
first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto but not including the last
day thereof.

From and after the occurrence of any Default hereunder, and so long as
any such Default remains unremedied or uncured thereafter, the Indebtedness
outstanding under this Note shall bear interest at a per annum rate of three
percent (3%) above the otherwise Applicable Interest Rate, which interest shall
be payable upon demand.

The amount and date of each Advance, its Applicable Interest Rate, its
Interest Period, if any, and the amount and date of any repayment shall be
noted on Bank's records, which records shall be conclusive evidence thereof,
absent manifest error; provided, however, any failure by Bank to make any such
notation, or any error in any such notation, shall not relieve Borrower of its
obligations to repay Bank all amounts payable by Borrower to Bank under or
pursuant to this Note, when due in accordance with the terms hereof.

Borrower may request an Advance hereunder, including the refunding of
an outstanding Advance as the same type of Advance or the conversion of an
outstanding Advance as the same type of Advance, upon the delivery to Bank of a
Request for Advance executed by an authorized officer of Borrower, subject to
the following:

(a)     no Default, and no condition or event which, with the giving
of notice or the running of time, or both, would constitute a
Default, shall have occurred and be continuing or exist under
this Note;





2
<PAGE>   34


(b)     each such Request for Advance shall set forth the information
required on the Request for Advance form annexed hereto as
Exhibit "A";

(c)     each such Request for Advance shall be delivered to Bank by
11:00 a.m. (Detroit, Michigan time) one (l) Business Day prior
to the proposed date of Advance in the case of
Eurodollar-based Advances, and by 11:00 a.m. (Detroit,
Michigan time) on the proposed date of Advance in the case of
Prime-based Advances;

(d)     the principal amount of each Eurodollar-based Advance shall be
at least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000);

(e)     the proposed date of any refunding of any outstanding
Eurodollar-based Advance as another Eurodollar-based Advance
or the conversion of any outstanding Eurodollar-based Advance
to a Prime-based Advance shall only be on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable to such outstanding
Eurodollar-based Advance; and

(f)     a Request for Advance, once delivered to Bank, shall not be
revocable by Borrower; provided, however, as aforesaid, Bank
shall not be obligated to make any Advance under this Note.

If, as to any outstanding Eurodollar-based Advance, Bank shall not
receive a timely Request for Advance in accordance with the foregoing
requesting the refunding of such Advance as a Eurodollar-based Advance, the
principal amount of such Advance which is not then repaid shall be
automatically converted to a Prime-based Advance on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, subject in all respects to the terms and
conditions of this Note. The foregoing shall not in any way whatsoever limit or
otherwise affect any of Bank's rights or remedies under this Note upon the
occurrence of any Default hereunder, or any condition or event which, with the
giving of notice or the running of time, or both, would constitute a Default.

Borrower may prepay all or part of the outstanding balance of any
Prime-based Advance under this Note at any time. Borrower may prepay all or
part of any Eurodollar-based Advance on the last day

<PAGE>   35

of the Interest Period applicable thereto, provided that the aggregate balance
of Eurodollar-based Advances outstanding after such prepayment shall be at
least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), and the unpaid portion of such
Eurodollar-based Advance which is then refunded or converted shall be subject
to the limitations set forth in this Note. Any prepayment made in accordance
with this paragraph shall be without premium or penalty. Any other prepayment
shall be otherwise restricted by and subject to the terms of this Note.

Subject to the definition of an "Interest Period" hereunder, in the
event that any payment under this Note becomes due and payable on any day which
is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and, to the extent applicable, interest shall continue
to accrue and be payable thereon during such extension at the rates set forth
in this Note.

All payments to be made by Borrower to Bank under or pursuant to this
Note shall be in immediately available funds, without setoff or counterclaim,
and in the event that any payments submitted hereunder are in funds not
available until collected, said payments shall continue to bear interest until
collected. Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to charge any account of Borrower
with Bank for all sums due hereunder when due in accordance with the terms
hereof.

If Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any
Eurodollar-based Advance on any day other than the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto (whether voluntarily, by acceleration, or otherwise),
or if Borrower fails to borrow any Eurodollar-based Advance after notice has
been given by Borrower to Bank in accordance with the terms of this Note
requesting such Advance, or if Borrower fails to make any payment of principal
or interest in respect of a Eurodollar-based Advance when due, Borrower shall
reimburse Bank, on demand, for any resulting loss, cost or expense incurred by
Bank as a result thereof, including, without limitation, any such loss, cost or
expense incurred in obtaining, liquidating, employing or redeploying deposits
from third parties, whether or not Bank shall have funded or committed to fund
such Advance. Such amount payable by Borrower to Bank may include, without
limitation, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of
interest which would have accrued on the





4
<PAGE>   36

amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, refunded or converted, for the period
from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, refund or
convert, through the last day of the relevant Interest Period, at the
applicable rate of interest for said Advance(s) provided under this Note, over
(b) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by Bank) which would have
accrued to Bank on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a
comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.
Calculation of any amounts payable to Bank under this paragraph shall be made
as though Bank shall have actually funded or committed to fund the relevant
Eurodollar-based Advance through the purchase of an underlying deposit in an
amount equal to the amount of such Advance and having a maturity comparable to
the relevant

Interest Period; provided, however, that Bank may fund any
Eurodollar-based Advance in any manner it deems fit and the foregoing
assumptions shall be utilized only for the purpose of the calculation of
amounts payable under this paragraph. Upon the written request of Borrower,
Bank shall deliver to Borrower a certificate setting forth the basis for
determining such losses, costs and expenses, which certificate shall be
conclusively presumed correct, absent manifest error.

For any Eurodollar-based Advance, if Bank shall designate a Eurodollar
Lending Office which maintains books separate from those of the rest of Bank,
Bank shall have the option of maintaining and carrying such Advance on the
books of such Eurodollar Lending Office.

If, with respect to any Interest Period, Bank determines that, (a) by
reason of circumstances affecting the foreign exchange and interbank markets
generally, deposits in Eurodollars in the applicable amounts or for the
relative maturities are not being offered to Bank for such Interest Period, or
(b) if the rate of interest referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar based
Rate" upon the basis of which the rate of interest for a Eurodollar-based
Advance is to be determined does not accurately or fairly cover or reflect the
cost to Bank of making or maintaining a Eurodollar-based Advance hereunder,
then Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter,
until Bank notifies Borrower that such conditions or circumstances no longer
exist, the right of Borrower to request a Eurodollar-based Advance and to
convert an





5
<PAGE>   37

Advance to or refund an Advance as a Eurodollar-based Advance shall be
suspended.

If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any
applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such authority, shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Bank (or
its Eurodollar Lending Office) to make or maintain any Advance with interest at
the Eurodollar-based Rate, Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to
Borrower. Thereafter, (a) until Bank notifies Borrower that such conditions or
circumstances no longer exist, the right of Borrower to request a
Eurodollar-based Advance and to convert an Advance to or refund an Advance as a
Eurodollar-based Advance shall be suspended, and thereafter, Borrower may
select only the Prime-based Rate as the Applicable Interest Rate hereunder, and
(b) if Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain an outstanding Advance to the
end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the Prime based
Rate shall be the Applicable Interest Rate for the remainder of such Interest
Period with respect to such outstanding Advance.

If the adoption after the date hereof, or any change after the date
hereof in, any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
made by any such authority, central bank or comparable agency after the date
hereof:

(a)     shall subject Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) to any
tax, duty or other charge with respect to this Note or any
Advance hereunder or shall change the basis of taxation of
payments to Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) of the
principal of or interest on any Advance or any other amounts
due under this Note in respect thereof (except for changes in
the rate of tax on the overall net income of Bank or its
Eurodollar Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which
Bank's principal executive office or Eurodollar Lending Office
is located); or





6
<PAGE>   38


(b)     shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
(including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by Bank (or its Eurodollar
Lending Office) or shall impose on Bank (or its Eurodollar
Lending Office) or the foreign exchange and interbank markets
any other condition affecting any Advance under this Note;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Bank of
maintaining any part of the indebtedness hereunder or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by Bank under this Note by an amount deemed by
the Bank to be material, then Borrower shall pay to Bank, within fifteen (15)
days of Borrower's receipt of written notice from Bank demanding such
compensation, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Bank for
such increased cost or reduction. A certificate of Bank, prepared in good faith
and in reasonable detail by Bank and submitted by Bank to Borrower, setting
forth the basis for determining such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate Bank shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error in computation.

In the event that any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation
(whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in effect and whether or not
presently applicable to Bank, or any interpretation or administration thereof
by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by Bank with any guideline, request or directive of any
such authority (whether or not having the force of law), including any
risk-based capital guidelines, affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by Bank (or any corporation controlling
Bank), and Bank determines that the amount of such capital is increased by or
based upon the existence of any obligations of Bank hereunder or the making or
maintaining any Advances hereunder, and such increase has the effect of
reducing the rate of return on Bank's (or such controlling corporation's)
capital as a consequence of such obligations or the making or maintaining of
such Advances hereunder to a level below that which Bank (or such controlling
corporation) could have achieved but for such circumstances (taking into
consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy), then





7
<PAGE>   39

Borrower shall pay to Bank, within fifteen (15) days of Borrower's receipt of
written notice from Bank demanding such compensation, additional amounts as are
sufficient to compensate Bank (or such controlling corporation) for any
increase in the amount of capital and reduced rate of return which Bank
reasonably determines to be allocable to the existence of any obligations of
the Bank hereunder or to the making or maintaining any Advances hereunder. A
certificate of Bank as to the amount of such compensation, prepared in good
faith and in reasonable detail by the Bank and submitted by Bank to Borrower,
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in
computation.

This Note and any other indebtedness and liabilities of any kind of
Borrower to Bank, and any and all modifications, renewals or extensions
thereof, whether joint or several, contingent or absolute, direct or indirect,
now existing or later arising, and however evidenced (collectively the
"Indebtedness"), are secured by and Bank is granted a security interest in all
items at any time deposited in any account of Borrower with Bank and by all
proceeds of these items (cash or otherwise), all account balances of Borrower
from time to time with Bank, by all property of Borrower from time to time in
the possession of Bank, and by any other collateral, rights and properties
described in each and every mortgage, security agreement, pledge, assignment
and other security or collateral agreement which has been, or will at any
time(s) later be, executed by Borrower or others to or for the benefit of Bank
(collectively the "Collateral").

If Borrower or any guarantor under a guaranty of all or part of the
Indebtedness ("guarantor") (a) fail(s) to pay this Note, or any part thereof,
or any of the Indebtedness when due, by maturity, acceleration or otherwise, or
fail(s) to pay any Indebtedness owing on a demand basis upon demand; or (b)
fail(s) to comply with any of the terms or provisions of any agreement between
Borrower or any guarantor and Bank; or (c) become(s) insolvent or the subject
of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding in bankruptcy, or a reorganization,
arrangement or creditor composition proceeding, (if a business entity) cease(s)
doing business as a going concern, (if a natural person) die(s) or become(s)
incompetent, (if a partnership) dissolve(s) or any general partner of it dies,
becomes incompetent or becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, or (if a
corporation) is the subject of a dissolution, merger or consolidation; or (d)
if any warranty or representation made by





8
<PAGE>   40

Borrower or any guarantor in connection with this Note or any of the
Indebtedness shall be discovered to be untrue or incomplete in any material
respect; (e) or if there is any termination, notice of termination, or breach
of any guaranty, pledge, collateral assignment or subordination agreement
relating to all or any part of the Indebtedness; or (f) if there is any failure
by Borrower or any guarantor to pay, when due, any of its indebtedness (other
than to the Bank) or in the observance or performance of any term, covenant or
condition in any document evidencing, securing or relating to such
indebtedness; or (g) if Bank deems itself insecure, believing in good faith
that the prospect of payment or performance of this Note or any of the
Indebtedness is materially impaired or shall fear deterioration, removal or
waste of any of the Collateral; or (h) if there is filed or issued a levy or
writ of attachment or garnishment or other like judicial process upon Borrower
or any guarantor or any of the Collateral, including, without limit, any
accounts of Borrower or any guarantor with Bank, then Bank, upon the occurrence
and at any time during the continuance or existence of any of these conditions
or events (each a "Default"), may at its option and without prior notice to
Borrower, declare any or all of the Indebtedness to be immediately due and
payable (notwithstanding any provisions contained in the evidence of it to the
contrary), sell or liquidate all or any portion of the Collateral, set off
against the Indebtedness any amounts owing by Bank to Borrower, and exercise
any one or more of the rights and remedies granted to Bank by any agreement
with Borrower given to it under applicable law, or otherwise.

Borrower waives presentment, demand, protest, notice of dishonor,
notice of demand or intent to demand, notice of acceleration or intent to
accelerate, and all other notices, and agrees that no extension or indulgence
to Borrower, or release, substitution or nonenforcement of any security, or
release or substitution of any guarantor or any other party, whether with or
without notice, shall affect the obligations of Borrower. Borrower waives all
defenses or right to discharge available under Section 3-605 of the Uniform
Commercial Code and waives all other suretyship defenses or right to discharge.
Borrower agrees that Bank has the right to sell, assign, or grant
participations, or any interest, in any or all of the Indebtedness, and that,
in connection with such right, but without limiting its ability to make other
disclosures to the full extent allowable, Bank may





9
<PAGE>   41

disclose all documents and information which the Bank now or later has relating
to Borrower and the Indebtedness.

Borrower agrees to reimburse Bank, or any other holder or owner of
this Note, for any and all costs and expenses (including, without limit, court
costs, legal expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees, whether inside or outside
counsel is used, whether or not suit is instituted, and, if suit is instituted,
whether at the trial court level, appellate level, in a bankruptcy, probate or
administrative proceeding or otherwise) incurred in collecting or attempting to
collect this Note or the Indebtedness or incurred in any other matter or
proceeding relating to this Note or the Indebtedness.

Borrower acknowledges and agrees that there are no contrary
agreements, oral or written, establishing a term of this Note and agrees that
the terms and conditions of this Note may not be amended, waived or modified
except in a writing signed by a duly authorized officer of Bank expressly
stating that the writing constitutes an amendment, waiver or modification of

any other instrument securing this Note or all or any part of the indebtedness
secured thereby, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall
involve exceeding the interest limitation validly prescribed by law which a
court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then, the
obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to an amount computed at the
highest rate of interest permissible under such applicable law, and if, for any
reason whatsoever, the Bank shall ever receive as interest an amount which

Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty Three and 33/100 Dollars ($270,833.33) each,
commencing on January 1, 1998, and on the first day of each calendar quarter
thereafter until November 1, 2000, when the entire unpaid balance of principal
and interest thereon shall be due and payable, together with interest thereon
as hereinafter set forth.

Company shall pay interest on the indebtedness outstanding under this
Note from time to time at the per annum rate equal to eight and six one
hundredths percent (8.06%) until November 1, 1999 when the interest rate shall
be a per annum rate equal to one half of one percent (1/2%) below Bank's Prime
Rate.  Upon the occurrence of any event of default described in the Loan
Agreement (as defined below) and maturity of the indebtedness hereunder
(whether at stated maturity or by acceleration), interest shall accrue on the
unpaid principal balance at a per annum rate as provided in the Loan Agreement
referred to below.  Interest shall be payable quarterly thereafter.  Interest
shall be computed on a daily basis using a year of 360 days and assessed for
the actual number of days elapsed, and, in such computation, effect shall be
given to any change in the interest rate resulting from a change in the Prime
Rate on the date of such change in the Prime Rate.  "Prime Rate" shall mean the
rate of interest established by Bank as its prime

rate as the same may be changed from time to time, which may not necessarily be
Bank's lowest rate for loans.

This Note evidences indebtedness incurred by Company under, is secured
pursuant to, may be matured as set forth in, and shall be prepaid in accordance
with, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered by and between
Company and Bank dated as of October 31, 1997 ("Loan Agreement"), the terms and
conditions of which are hereby incorporated herein.  Upon an event of default,
as described in the Loan Agreement, Bank shall be entitled to all of the rights
and remedies described therein or to which it is entitled under applicable law.

As additional security, Bank is granted a lien on all property and
assets (including deposits and other credits) of Company at any time in
possession or control (or owing by) Bank for any purpose.

If the interest and principal hereof are not fully paid at maturity
hereof (whether by demand or otherwise), Company shall pay the holder hereof
all its reasonable costs of collection of said principal and interest
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees.

All agreements between Company and Bank pertaining to the indebtedness
described herein are expressly limited so that in no event whatsoever shall the
amount of interest paid or agreed to be paid to Bank exceed the highest rate of
interest permissible under applicable law.  If, from any circumstances
whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of the Loan Agreement, this Note or
any other instrument securing this Note or all or any part of the indebtedness
secured thereby, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall
involve exceeding the interest limitation validly prescribed by law which a
court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then, the
obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to an amount computed at the
highest rate of interest permissible under such applicable law, and if, for any
reason whatsoever, the Bank shall ever receive as interest an amount which
would be deemed unlawful under such applicable law, such interest shall be
automatically applied to the payment of the principal amount described herein
or otherwise owed by Company to Bank, (whether or not then due and payable) and
not to the payment of interest.

CREDIT FACILITIES

Section 2.1. Commitment as to Revolving Facility. Each Bank
hereby agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, to
make Revolving Advances to the Borrower from time to time during the period from
the date hereof to and including the Revolving Commitment Termination Date, in
an aggregate amount at any time outstanding not to exceed such Bank's Percentage
of each Borrowing from time to time requested by the Borrower under the
Revolving Facility; provided, however, that (a) the Revolving Facility
Outstanding Amount shall at no time exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount and
(b) no Bank's Percentage of the Revolving Facility Outstanding Amount shall at
any time exceed such Bank's Revolving Commitment. Within the above limits, the
Borrower may obtain Revolving Advances, prepay Revolving Advances in accordance
with the terms hereof and reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the
applicable terms and conditions of this Article II.

Section 2.2. Commitment as to Term Facility. Each Bank hereby
agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, to make a
single Term Advance to the Borrower on the Closing Date in an amount equal to
such Bank's Term Commitment. The Term Facility is not a revolving facility and,
once the initial Term Advance is made by a Bank, such Bank shall have no further
obligation to make any additional Term Advances to the Borrower under the Term
Facility, whether or not any amounts are repaid thereunder.

Section 2.3. Procedures for Borrowing Under the Revolving
Facility. Each Borrowing under the Revolving Facility shall be funded by the
Banks as either Floating Rate Advances or Eurodollar Advances, as the Borrower
shall specify in the related notice of proposed Borrowing. Floating Rate
Advances and Eurodollar Advances may be outstanding at the same time. It is
understood, however, that (i) in the case of a Borrowing which is to bear
interest at a Floating Rate, the principal amount of the Borrowing shall be in
an amount equal to or greater than $500,000 or a higher integral multiple of
$100,000 and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing which is to bear interest at a
Eurodollar Rate, the principal amount of the Borrowing shall be in an amount
equal to $1,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $100,000. The Borrower
shall give notice to the Agent of each proposed Borrowing not later than 10:30
a.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on a Business Day which, in the case of a
Borrowing that is to bear interest initially at a Floating Rate, is the proposed
date of such Borrowing or, in the case of a Borrowing that is to bear interest
initially at a Eurodollar Rate, is at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
proposed date of such Borrowing. Each such notice shall be effective upon
receipt by the Agent, shall be in writing or by telephone or telecopy
transmission, to be confirmed in writing by the Borrower if so requested by the
Agent (in the form of Exhibit C), and shall specify whether the Borrowing is to
bear interest initially at a Floating Rate or a Eurodollar Rate, and in the case
of a Borrowing that is to bear interest initially at a Eurodollar Rate, shall
specify the Interest Period to be applicable thereto. Promptly upon receipt of
such notice (but in no event later than 12:00 Noon,


E-14                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


Minneapolis, Minnesota time, with respect to a Floating Rate Advance, and the
close of business, with respect to a Eurodollar Advance, in each case on the
Business Day of receipt of such notice), the Agent shall advise each Bank of the
proposed Borrowing. At or before 2:00 p.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on the
date of the requested Borrowing, each Bank shall provide the Agent at the
principal office of the Agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota with immediately
available funds covering such Bank's Percentage of such Borrowing. Subject to
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Article III with respect
to such Borrowing, the Agent shall pay over such funds to the Borrower prior to
the close of business on the date of the requested Borrowing.

Section 2.4. Converting Floating Rate Fundings to Eurodollar
Fundings; Procedures. So long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, the
Borrower may convert all or any part of any outstanding Floating Rate Funding
into a Eurodollar Funding by giving notice to the Agent of such conversion not
later than 10:30 a.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on a Business Day which is
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion.
Each such notice shall be irrevocable, shall be effective upon receipt by the
Agent, shall be in writing or by telephone or telecopy transmission, to be
confirmed in writing by the Borrower if so requested by the Agent (in the form
of Exhibit D), shall specify the date and amount of such conversion, the total
amount of the Funding to be so converted and the Interest Period therefor. Each
conversion of a Funding shall be on a Business Day, and the aggregate amount of
each such conversion of a Floating Rate Funding to a Eurodollar Funding shall be
in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $100,000.

Section 2.5. Procedures at End of an Interest Period. Unless
the Borrower requests a new Eurodollar Funding in accordance with the procedures
set forth below, or prepays the principal of an outstanding Eurodollar Funding
at the expiration of an Interest Period, each Bank shall automatically and
without request of the Borrower convert each Eurodollar Funding to a Floating
Rate Funding on the last day of the relevant Interest Period. So long as no
Default or Event of Default shall exist, the Borrower may cause all or any part
of any outstanding Eurodollar Funding to continue to bear interest at a
Eurodollar Rate after the end of the then applicable Interest Period by
notifying the Agent not later than 10:30 a.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on a
Business Day which is at least two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of
the new Interest Period. Each such notice shall be in writing or by telephone or
telecopy transmission, to be confirmed in writing by the Borrower if so
requested by the Agent (in the form of Exhibit E), shall be irrevocable,
effective when received by the Agent, and shall specify the first day of the
applicable Interest Period, the amount of the expiring Eurodollar Funding to be
continued and the Interest Period therefor. Each new Interest Period shall begin
on a Business Day and the amount of each Funding bearing a new Eurodollar Rate
shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of
$100,000.

Section 2.6. Setting and Notice of Rates. The applicable
Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Agent on the
second Business Day prior to


E-15                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


the beginning of such Interest Period, whereupon notice thereof (which may be by
telephone) shall be given by the Agent to the Borrower and each Bank. Each such
determination of the applicable Eurodollar Rate shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties hereto, in the absence of demonstrable error. The Agent, upon
written request of the Borrower or any Bank, shall deliver to the Borrower or
such requesting Bank a statement showing the computations used by the Agent in
determining the applicable Eurodollar Rate hereunder.

Section 2.7. Interest on Obligations. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each unpaid Obligation
for the period commencing on the date of this Agreement until the unpaid
principal amount thereof is paid in full, in accordance with the following:

(a) Floating Rate Fundings. Subject to subsection (c) below,
while any outstanding principal of a Note constitutes a Floating Rate
Funding, the outstanding principal balance thereof shall bear interest
at an annual rate at all times equal to the Floating Rate applicable to
such Floating Rate Funding.

(b) Eurodollar Fundings. Subject to subsection (c) below,
while any outstanding principal of a Note constitutes a Eurodollar
Funding, the outstanding principal balance thereof shall bear interest
for the applicable Interest Period at an annual rate equal to the
Eurodollar Rate established with respect such Eurodollar Funding in
accordance with Section 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5 hereof.

(c) Default Rate. From and after the occurrence of an Event of
Default and continuing thereafter until such Event of Default shall be
remedied to the written satisfaction of the Required Banks, the
outstanding principal balance of each Note shall bear interest, until
paid in full, at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the interest rate
otherwise in effect with respect to such outstanding principal and (ii)
two percent (2%). In addition, all fees, indemnification obligations
and other Obligations not paid when due hereunder shall bear interest,
until paid in full, at an annual rate equal to the sum of (i) the
Floating Rate (with the then applicable Revolving Facility Margin) and
(ii) two percent (2%) (each rate described in this subsection (c)
herein a "Default Rate").

Section 2.8. Obligation to Repay Advances; Representations.
The Borrower shall be obligated to repay all Advances under this Article II
notwithstanding the failure of the Agent to receive any written request therefor
or written confirmation thereof and notwithstanding the fact that the person
requesting the same was not in fact authorized to do so. Any request for a
Borrowing under Section 2.3, whether written, telephonic, telecopy or otherwise,
shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that (a) the amount of
the requested Borrowing, when added to the Revolving Facility Outstanding
Amount, would not exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount and (b) the statements
set forth in Section 3.2 are correct as of the time of the request.

installments, commencing on October 1, 2000, and continuing on the

principal on the Term Note described above, in the event that the
Borrower or any Subsidiary sells the stock of any Subsidiary or the
Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries sell any assets (other than the sale
of Inventory in the ordinary course of business) or the Borrower and/or
its Subsidiaries engage in any similar transactions which result in net
cash proceeds received by the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries and the
aggregate amount of net cash proceeds received by the Borrower and/or
its Subsidiaries from all such sales and transactions in any fiscal
year of the Borrower exceed $5,000,000, then, on the last day of the

quarter of such fiscal year in which such net cash proceeds are
received, the Borrower shall make a prepayment of the unpaid principal
balance of the Term Note in an amount equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of such net cash proceeds in excess of such $5,000,000 annual
amount. Any mandatory prepayment of the Term Note occasioned by any
such sale of stock, assets or other similar transactions shall be in
addition to the required quarterly installments of principal of the
Term Note and shall be applied against such remaining quarterly
installments of principal of the Term Note in inverse order of their
maturity. The Borrower acknowledges that Article VI of this Agreement
contains provisions which restrict the ability of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries to sell stock, to sell assets and to engage in similar
transactions without the prior written consent of the Required Banks
and the Borrower acknowledges that it must obtain such prior written
consent before engaging in any restricted sale or similar transaction.

businesses of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, together with actual
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in conducting any such audit
or inspection.

Section 2.13. Use of Proceeds. The Proceeds of each Borrowing
under the Revolving Facility shall be used by the Borrower solely for its
working capital purposes. The Proceeds of the Term Facility shall be used by the
Borrower to finance a portion of the purchase price paid by the Borrower for the
acquisition of Innovex Southwest.

Section 2.14. Voluntary Reduction or Termination of the
Commitments; Prepayments.

(a) Reduction or Termination of Revolving Commitments. The
Borrower, from time to time upon not less than five (5) Business Days'
prior written notice to the Agent, may permanently reduce the Revolving
Commitment Amount; provided, however, that no such reduction shall
reduce the Revolving Commitment Amount to an amount less than the
Revolving Facility Outstanding Amount. Any such voluntary reduction
shall be pro rata as to all Revolving Commitments according to each
Bank's Percentage of the Revolving Facility and shall be in an
aggregate amount equal to $5,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of
$1,000,000. The Borrower at any time prior to the Revolving Commitment
Termination Date may terminate the Revolving Commitments by (i)
providing to the Agent not less than five (5) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to so terminate the Revolving
Commitments and (ii) making payment in full of all principal and
interest on the Revolving Notes.

(b) Prepayments. The Borrower from time to time may
voluntarily prepay the Notes in whole or in part. In the event of any
voluntary prepayment hereunder (i) any prepayment of a Facility shall
be applied against outstanding Advances of each Bank under that
Facility pro rata according to each Bank's Percentage of that Facility,
(ii) each prepayment of the Notes shall be made to the Agent not later
than 12:00 Noon, Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on a Business Day, and
funds received after that hour shall be deemed to have been received by
the Agent on the next following Business Day, (iii) each partial
prepayment of Fundings which, at the time of such prepayment, bear
interest at a Eurodollar Rate shall be accompanied by accrued interest
on such partial prepayment through the date of prepayment and
additional compensation calculated in accordance with Section 2.18,
(iv) each partial prepayment of Fundings with respect to a Facility
which, at the time of such prepayment, bear interest at a Eurodollar
Rate, shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable minimum
Funding amount specified in Section 2.5 for such Facility and, after
application of any such prepayment, shall not result in a Eurodollar
Funding remaining outstanding in an amount less than such minimum
Funding amount, (v)


E-19                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


each partial prepayment of Fundings with respect to a Facility which,
at the time of such prepayment, bear interest at a Floating Rate, shall
be in an aggregate amount equal to $500,000 or a higher integral
multiple of $100,000, unless (in either case) the aggregate outstanding
balance of all Notes under the Facility being prepaid is less than such
minimum Funding amount, in which event any such prepayment may be in
such lesser amount, (vi) unless notified by the Borrower in writing to
the contrary, the Agent shall apply all partial prepayments to
outstanding Revolving Advances and, if no Revolving Advances are then
outstanding, to outstanding Term Advances and (vii) each partial
prepayment of the Term Facility shall be applied to principal
installments becoming due under such Facility in inverse order of their
respective maturities.

Section 2.15. Payments.

(a) Making of Payments. All payments of principal of and
interest due with respect to a Facility shall be made to the Agent for
the account of the Banks pro rata according to their respective
Percentages of such Facility; provided, that any such payments so
received by the Agent after the termination of the Revolving
Commitments following the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder
shall be allocated among the Banks pro rata according to their Default
Percentages. All payments of fees pursuant to Section 2.12 shall be
made to the Agent (i) for the account of the Agent as to all amounts
specified in Section 2.12 as payable for the exclusive account of the
Agent and (ii) for the account of the Banks pro rata according to their
respective Percentages as to all fees specified in Section 2.12 as
payable for the account of the Banks. All payments to the Agent shall
be made to the Agent at its office in Minneapolis, Minnesota, not later
than 12:00 Noon, Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on the date due, in
immediately available funds, and funds received after that hour shall
be deemed to have been received by the Agent on the next following
Business Day. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent to charge the
Borrower's demand deposit account maintained with the Agent (or with
any other Bank) for the amount of any Obligation on its due date, but
the Agent's failure to so charge any such account shall in no way
affect the obligation of the Borrower to make any such payment. The
Agent shall remit to each Bank in immediately available funds on the
same Business Day as received by the Agent its share of all such
payments received by the Agent for the account of such Bank. If the
Agent fails to remit any payment to any Bank when required hereby, the
Agent shall pay interest on demand to that Bank for each day during the
period commencing on the date such remittance was due until the date
such remittance is made at an annual rate equal to the Federal Funds
Rate for such day. All payments under Section 2.16, 2.17 or 2.18 shall
be made by the Borrower directly to the Bank entitled thereto.

(b) Effect of Payments. Each payment by the Borrower to the
Agent for the account of any Bank pursuant to Section 2.15(a) shall be
deemed to constitute payment by the Borrower directly to such Bank,
provided, however, that in the event


E-20                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


any such payment by the Borrower to the Agent is required to be
returned to the Borrower for any reason whatsoever, then the Borrower's
obligation to such Bank with respect to such payment shall be deemed to
be automatically reinstated.

(c) Distributions by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have been
notified by a Bank or the Borrower prior to the date on which such Bank
or the Borrower is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (in the
case of a Bank) the proceeds of an Advance to be made by it hereunder
or (in the case of the Borrower) a payment to the Agent for the account
of one or more of the Banks hereunder (such payment by a Bank or the
Borrower (as the case may be) being herein called a "Required
Payment"), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that it does
not intend to make the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may
assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance
upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount
thereof available to the intended recipient(s) on such date and, if
such Bank or the Borrower (as the case may be) has not in fact made the
Required Payment to the Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment shall,
on demand, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together
with interest thereon for each day during the period commencing on the
date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the
Agent recovers such amount at a rate (i) equal to the Federal Funds
Rate for such day, in the case of a Required Payment owing by a Bank,
or (ii) equal to the applicable rate of interest as provided in this
Agreement, in the case of a Required Payment owing by the Borrower.

(d) Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each Bank, subject to
such Bank's sharing obligations set forth in Section 8.6, shall have
all rights of setoff and bankers' lien provided by applicable law, and
in addition thereto, the Borrower agrees that if at any time any
Obligation is due and owing by the Borrower under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents to any Bank at a time when an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing hereunder, any Bank may apply any and all
balances, credits, and deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrower
then or thereafter in the possession of such Bank (excluding, however,
any trust or escrow accounts held by the Borrower for the benefit of
any third party) to the payment thereof.

(e) Due Date Extension. If any payment of principal of or
interest on any Floating Rate Funding or any fees payable hereunder
falls due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such due date
shall be extended to the next following Business Day, and (in the case
of principal) additional interest shall accrue and be payable for the
period of such extension.

(f) Application of Payments. Except as otherwise provided
herein, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing hereunder, each payment received from the Borrower shall be
applied to such Obligation as the Borrower shall specify by notice to
be received by the Agent on or before the date of such payment, or in
the absence of such notice, as the Agent shall determine in its


E-21                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


discretion. Concurrently with each remittance to any Bank of its
appropriate share of any such payment (based upon such Bank's
Percentage of the Facility to which such payment relates), the Agent
shall advise such Bank as to the application of such payment. Except as
otherwise provided in Article VIII, after the termination of the
Revolving Commitments following the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default, all payments received by the Agent or any Bank from the
Borrower shall be shared on the basis of each Bank's Default Percentage
thereof.

Section 2.16. Taxes. All payments made by the Borrower to the
Agent or any Bank (herein any "Payee") under or in connection with this
Agreement or the Notes shall be made without any setoff or other counterclaim,
and shall be free and clear of and without deduction for or on account of any
present or future taxes now or hereafter imposed by any governmental or other
authority, except to the extent that any such deduction or withholding is
compelled by law. As used herein, the term "Taxes" shall include all income,
excise and other taxes of whatever nature (other than taxes generally assessed
on the overall net income of a Payee by the government or other authority of the
country, state or political subdivision in which such Payee is incorporated or
in which the office through which such Payee is acting is located) as well as
all levies, imposts, duties, charges, or fees of whatever nature. "Taxes" shall
not include, however, any foreign withholding taxes or similar deductions
imposed solely as a result of a Bank's election to fund an Advance through a
foreign office of such Bank. If the Borrower is compelled by law to make any
deductions or withholdings on account of any Taxes (including any foreign
withholding) it will:

(a) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required
to be so withheld or deducted;

(b) pay such additional amounts (including, without
limitation, any penalties, interest or expenses) as may be necessary in
order that the net amount received by the Payee after such deductions
or withholdings (including any required deduction or withholding on
such additional amounts) shall equal the amount the Payee would have
received had no such deductions or withholdings been made; and

(c) promptly forward to the Agent (for delivery to the
appropriate Payee) an official receipt or other documentation
satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment to such authorities.

The amount that the Borrower shall be required to pay to any Payee pursuant to
the foregoing clause (b) shall be reduced, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, by the amount of any offsetting tax benefit which such Payee receives as
the result of the Borrower's payment to the relevant authorities as reasonably
determined by such Payee; provided, however, that if such Payee shall
subsequently determine that it has lost the benefit of all or a portion of such
tax benefit, the Borrower shall promptly remit to such Payee the amount
certified by such Payee to be the amount necessary to restore such Payee to the
position it would have been in if no payment had been made pursuant to this
sentence. If any Taxes otherwise payable by


E-22                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


the Borrower pursuant to the foregoing are directly asserted against a Payee,
such Payee may pay such taxes and the Borrower promptly shall reimburse such
Payee to the full extent otherwise required under this Section 2.16. The
obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.16 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

If circumstances arise in respect of any Bank which would, or
would upon the giving of notice, result in any liability of the Borrower under
this Section 2.16 then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise
qualifying the Borrower's obligations under this Section 2.16 such Bank shall
promptly, upon becoming aware of the same, notify the Agent and the Borrower
thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Borrower and to the
extent that it can do so without, in its reasonable judgment, disadvantaging
itself, take such reasonable steps as may be available to it to mitigate the
effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, the designation of
an alternate office or the transfer of its Eurodollar Fundings to another
office). If and so long as a Bank has been unable to take, or has not taken,
steps reasonably acceptable to the Borrower to mitigate the effect of the
circumstances in question, such Bank shall be obliged, at the request of the
Borrower, to assign all its rights and obligations hereunder to another Person
designated by the Borrower with the approval of the Agent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) which is willing to participate in the Revolving Facility
in place of such Bank; provided that such Person satisfies all of the
requirements of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, providing the
forms and documents required by Section 8.14 and any such Person shall cover all
costs incurred in connection with effecting such replacement.

Section 2.17. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy; Funding
Exceptions.

(a) Increased Costs on Eurodollar Advances. If Regulation D of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or after the date
of this Agreement the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
regulation, or any change in any existing law, or any change in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by a Bank with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall:

(i) subject a Bank to or cause the withdrawal or
termination of any exemption previously granted to a Bank with
respect to, any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its
Eurodollar Fundings or its obligation to make Eurodollar
Fundings, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to
a Bank of the principal of or interest under this Agreement in
respect of its Eurodollar Fundings or its obligation to make
Eurodollar Fundings (except for changes in the rate of tax on
the overall net income of a Bank imposed by the jurisdictions
in which a Bank's principal executive office is located); or


E-23                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


(ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
(including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but
excluding any reserve included in the determination of
interest rates pursuant to Section 2.6), special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended by, a Bank; or

(iii) impose on a Bank any other condition affecting
its making, maintaining or funding of its Eurodollar Fundings
or its obligation to make Eurodollar Fundings;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to an
affected Bank of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Funding, or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank under
this Agreement or under its Notes with respect to a Eurodollar Funding,
then the affected Bank will notify the Borrower and the Agent of such
increased cost and within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Bank
(which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the
basis of such demand) the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such
increased cost or such reduction; provided, however, that no such
increased cost or such reduction shall be payable by the Borrower for
any period longer than forty-five (45) days prior to the date on which
notice thereof is delivered to the Borrower. Each Bank will promptly
notify the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring
after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation
pursuant to this Section 2.17. If the Borrower receives notice from a
Bank of any event which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant
to this Section 2.17 the Borrower may prepay any then outstanding
Eurodollar Fundings or notify the affected Bank that any pending
request for a Eurodollar Funding shall be deemed to be a request for a
Floating Rate Funding, in each case subject to the provisions of
Section 2.18.

(b) Capital Adequacy. If a Bank determines at any time that
such Bank's Return has been reduced as a result of any Capital Adequacy
Rule Change, such Bank may require the Borrower to pay to such Bank the
amount necessary to restore such Bank's Return to what it would have
been had there been no Capital Adequacy Rule Change. For purposes of
this Section 2.17b), the following definitions shall apply:

(i) "Return", for any calendar quarter or shorter
period, means the percentage determined by dividing (A) the
sum of interest and ongoing fees earned by a Bank under this
Agreement during such period by (B) the average capital such
Bank is required to maintain during such period as a result of
its being a party to this Agreement, as determined by such
Bank based upon its total capital requirements and a
reasonable attribution formula that takes account of the
Capital Adequacy Rules then in effect. Return may be
calculated for a Bank for each calendar quarter and for the
shorter period


E-24                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


between the end of a calendar quarter and the date of
termination in whole of this Agreement.

(ii) "Capital Adequacy Rule" means any law, rule,
regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy that
applies to a Bank, or the interpretation thereof by any
governmental or regulatory authority. Capital Adequacy Rules
include rules requiring financial institutions to maintain
total capital in amounts based upon percentages of outstanding
loans, binding loan commitments and letters of credit.

(iii) "Capital Adequacy Rule Change" means any change
in any Capital Adequacy Rule occurring after the date of this
Agreement, but does not include any changes in applicable
requirements that at the date hereof are scheduled to take
place under the existing Capital Adequacy Rules or any
increases in the capital that a Bank is required to maintain
to the extent that the increases are required due to a
regulatory authority's assessment of such Bank's financial
condition.

The initial notice sent by a Bank shall be sent as promptly as
practicable after such Bank learns that its Return has been reduced,
shall include a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore
such Bank's Return for the quarter in which the notice is sent, and
shall state in reasonable detail the cause for the reduction in such
Bank's Return and such Bank's calculation of the amount of such
reduction. Thereafter, a Bank may send a new notice during each
calendar quarter setting forth the calculation of the reduced Return
for that quarter and including a demand for payment of the amount
necessary to restore such Bank's Return for that quarter. A Bank's
calculation in any such notice shall be conclusive and binding absent
demonstrable error.

(c) Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair.
If with respect to any Interest Period:

(i) the Agent determines that, or the Required Banks
determine and advise the Agent that, deposits in U.S. dollars
(in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the
London interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period;
or

(ii) the Agent otherwise determines, or the Required
Banks determine and advise the Agent (which determination
shall be binding and conclusive on all parties), that by
reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank
eurodollar market adequate and reasonable means do not exist
for ascertaining the applicable Eurodollar Rate; or


E-25                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


(iii) the Agent determines, or the Required Banks
determine and advise the Agent, that the Eurodollar Rate as
determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect
the cost to the Banks of maintaining or funding a Eurodollar
Funding for such Interest Period, or that the making or
funding of Eurodollar Fundings has become impracticable as a
result of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement
which in the opinion of such Banks materially affects such
Eurodollar Fundings;

then the Agent shall promptly notify the affected parties and (A) in
the event of any occurrence described in the foregoing clause (i) the
Borrower shall enter into good faith negotiations with each affected
Bank in order to determine an alternate method to determine the
Eurodollar Rate for such Bank, and during the pendency of such
negotiations with any Bank, such Bank shall be under no obligation to
make any new Eurodollar Fundings, and (B) in the event of any
occurrence described in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), for so
long as such circumstances shall continue, no Bank shall be under any
obligation to make any new Eurodollar Fundings.

(d) Illegality. In the event that any change in (including the
adoption of any new) applicable laws or regulations, or any change in
the interpretation of applicable laws or regulations by any
governmental authority, central bank, comparable agency or any other
regulatory body charged with the interpretation, implementation or
administration thereof, or compliance by a Bank with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank, comparable agency or other regulatory body,
should make it or, in the good faith judgment of the affected Bank,
shall raise a substantial question as to whether it is unlawful for
such Bank to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Fundings, then (i) the
affected Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent, (ii)
the obligation of the affected Bank to make, maintain or convert into
Eurodollar Fundings shall, upon the effectiveness of such event, be
suspended for the duration of such unlawfulness, and (iii) for the
duration of such unlawfulness, any notice by the Borrower pursuant to
Sections 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5 requesting the affected Bank to make or
convert into Eurodollar Fundings shall be construed as a request to
make or to continue making Floating Rate Fundings.

(e) Procedures to Mitigate. If circumstances arise in respect
of any Bank which would or would upon the giving of notice result in
any liability of the Borrower under this Section 2.17 then, without in
any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the Borrower's
obligations under this Section 2.17, such Bank shall promptly, upon
becoming aware of the same, notify the Agent and the Borrower thereof
and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Borrower and to the
extent that it can do so without, in its reasonable judgment,
disadvantaging itself, take such reasonable steps as may be available
to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without
limitation, the designation of an alternate office or the transfer of


E-26                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


its Eurodollar Fundings to another office). If and so long as a Bank
has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps reasonably acceptable
to the Borrower to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in
question, such Bank shall be obliged, at the request of the Borrower,
to assign all its rights and obligations hereunder to another Person
designated by the Borrower with the approval of the Agent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld) and willing to participate in the
Revolving Facility in place of such Bank; provided that such Person
satisfies all of the requirements of this Agreement, including, but not
limited to, providing the forms and documents required by Section 8.14
and any such Person shall cover all costs incurred in connection with
effecting such replacement.

Section 2.18. Funding Losses. The Borrower hereby agrees that
upon demand by any Bank (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement
setting forth the basis for the calculations of the amount being claimed) the
Borrower will indemnify such Bank against any loss or expense which such Bank
may have sustained or incurred (including, without limitation, any net loss or
expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by such Bank to fund or maintain Eurodollar Fundings) or
which such Bank may be deemed to have sustained or incurred, as reasonably
determined by such Bank, (i) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to
make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with any
Eurodollar Fundings, (ii) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow or
convert any Eurodollar Fundings on a date specified therefor in a notice thereof
or (iii) due to any payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Funding on a date
other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period for such Eurodollar
Funding. For this purpose, all notices under Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 shall be
deemed to be irrevocable.

Section 2.19. Right of Banks to Fund through Other Offices.
Each Bank, if it so elects, may fulfill its agreements hereunder with respect to
any Eurodollar Funding by causing a foreign branch or affiliate of such Bank to
make such Eurodollar Funding; provided, that in such event the obligation of the
Borrower to repay such Eurodollar Funding shall nevertheless be to such Bank and
such Eurodollar Funding shall be deemed held by such Bank for the account of
such branch or affiliate.

Section 2.20. Discretion of Banks as to Manner of Funding.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Bank shall
be entitled to fund and maintain all or any part of its Eurodollar Fundings in
any manner it deems fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of
this Agreement (specifically including, without limitation, Section 2.18 hereof)
all determinations hereunder shall be made as if each Bank had actually funded
and maintained each Eurodollar Funding during each Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Funding through the purchase of deposits having a maturity
corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the
appropriate Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.


E-27                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


Section 2.21. Conclusiveness of Statements; Survival of
Provisions. Determinations and statements of a Bank pursuant to Section 2.16,
2.17, or 2.18 shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. Each Bank may use
reasonable averaging and attribution methods in determining compensation
pursuant to such Sections 2.16, 2.17 or 2.18 and the provisions of Sections
2.16, 2.17 and 2.18 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

AGREEMENT AMONG BANKS AND AGENT

Section 8.1. Authorization; Powers; Agent for Collateral
Purposes. Each Bank irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as
administrative agent for and on behalf of such Bank to the extent provided
herein, in any Loan Documents or in any other document or instrument delivered
hereunder or in connection herewith, and to take such other actions as may be
reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent agrees to act as administrative agent
for each Bank upon the express conditions contained in this Article VIII, but in
no event shall the Agent constitute a fiduciary of any Bank, nor shall the Agent
have any fiduciary responsibilities in respect of any Bank. In furtherance of
the foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, each Bank irrevocably (a)
authorizes the Agent to execute and deliver and perform those obligations under
each of the Loan Documents to which the Agent is a party as are specifically
delegated to the Agent, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies as may
be specifically delegated hereunder or thereunder, together with such additional
powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto, (b) appoints the Agent as
nominal


E-46                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


beneficiary or nominal secured party, as the case may be, under the Loan
Documents and all related UCC financing statements, and (c) authorizes the Agent
to act as agent of and for such Bank for purposes of holding, perfecting and
disposing of Collateral under the Loan Documents. As to any matters not
expressly provided for by the Loan Documents, the Agent shall not be required to
exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to
refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining
from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Banks or, if so required
pursuant to Section 9.2, upon the instructions of all Banks; provided, however,
that except for action expressly required of the Agent hereunder, the Agent
shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder
unless it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and
all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action, and the Agent shall not in any event be
required to take any action which is contrary to the Loan Documents or
applicable law.

Section 8.2. Application of Proceeds. The Agent, after
deduction of any costs of collection, as provided in Section 8.5, shall remit to
each Bank (to the extent a Bank is to share therein) that Bank's pro rata share
of all payments of principal, interest and fees payable hereunder in accordance
with such Bank's appropriate Percentage with respect to the Facility under which
such payments are received; provided, however, that all payments received after
the termination of the Revolving Commitments following the occurrence of an
Event of Default, after application to the costs and expenses incurred by the
Agent or any Bank in collection thereof (as contemplated in Section 8.5), shall
be allocated to the Banks in accordance with their Default Percentages. Each
Bank's interest under the Loan Documents shall be payable solely from payments,
collections and proceeds actually received by the Agent under the Loan
Documents; and the Agent's only liability to a Bank with respect to any such
payments, collections and proceeds shall be to account for such Bank's
Percentage (or Default Percentage, as the case may be) of such payments,
collections and proceeds in accordance with this Agreement. If the Agent is
required for any reason to refund any such payments, collections or proceeds,
each Bank will refund to the Agent, upon demand, its Percentage (or Default
Percentage, as the case may be) of such payments, collections or proceeds,
together with its Percentage (or Default Percentage, as the case may be) of
interest or penalties, if any, payable by the Agent in connection with such
refund. If any Bank has wrongfully refused to fund its Percentage of any
Borrowing, or if the outstanding principal balance of the Advances made by any
Bank under a Facility is for any other reason less than its respective
Percentage of the aggregate principal balance of all Advances under that
Facility, the Agent may remit payments received by it to the other Banks until
such payments have reduced the aggregate amounts owed by the Borrower to the
extent that the aggregate amount of the Advances owing to such Bank hereunder
are equal to its Percentage of the aggregate amounts of the Advances owing under
the applicable Facility to all of the Banks hereunder. The foregoing provision
is intended only to set forth certain rules for the application of payments,
proceeds and collections in the event that a Bank has breached its obligations
hereunder and shall not be deemed to excuse any Bank from such obligations.


E-47                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


Section 8.3. Exculpation. The Agent shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent in connection with the Loan
Documents, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning legal matters, the
advice of independent public accountants with respect to accounting matters and
advice of other experts as to any other matters and upon any Loan Document and
any schedule, certificate, statement, report, notice or other writing which it
reasonably believes to be genuine or to have been presented by a proper Person.
Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall
be responsible or in any way liable for (a) any recitals, representations or
warranties contained in, or for the execution, validity, genuineness,
effectiveness or enforceability of any Loan Document, or any other instrument or
document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (b) the validity,
genuineness, perfection, effectiveness, enforceability, existence, value of
enforcement of any Collateral or (c) any action taken or omitted by it. The
designation of Norwest as Agent hereunder shall in no way impair or affect any
of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, Norwest
in its individual capacity as Bank hereunder.

Section 8.4. Use of the Term "Agent". The term "Agent" is used
herein in reference to the Agent merely as a matter of custom. It is intended to
reflect only an administrative relationship between the Agent and the Banks, in
each case as independent contracting parties. However, the obligations of the
Agent shall be limited to those expressly set forth herein and in no event shall
the use of such term create or imply any fiduciary relationship or any other
obligation arising under the general law of agency.

Section 8.5. Reimbursement for Costs and Expenses. All
payments, collections and proceeds received or effected by the Agent may be
applied first to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable costs and
expenses at any time incurred by or imposed upon the Agent in connection with
this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including but not limited to all
reasonable attorney's fees (including allocated costs of in-house counsel),
foreclosure expenses and advances made to protect the security of any
Collateral, but excluding any costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent). If the Agent does
not receive payments, collections or proceeds sufficient to cover any such costs
and expenses within five (5) days after their incurrence or imposition, each
Bank shall, upon demand, remit to the Agent such Bank's Percentage of the
difference between (i) such costs and expenses and (ii) such payments,
collections and proceeds, together with interest on such amount for each day
following the thirtieth day after demand therefor until so remitted at a rate
equal to the Federal Funds Rate for each such day.

Section 8.6. Payments Received Directly by Banks. If any Bank
shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by
application of offset or otherwise) on account of any Facility or on account of
any fees under this Agreement (other than through distributions made in
accordance with Section 8.2 hereof) in excess of such


E-48                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


Bank's applicable Percentage with respect to such Facility (or such Bank's
Default Percentage, if applicable), such Bank shall promptly give notice of such
fact to the Agent and shall promptly remit to the Agent such amount as shall be
necessary to cause the remitting Bank to share such excess payment or other
recovery ratably with each of the Banks in accordance with their respective
Percentages, (or Default Percentages, as the case may be) together with interest
for each day on such amount until so remitted at a rate equal to the Federal
Funds Rate for each such day; provided, however, that if all or any portion of
the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such remitting
Bank or holder, the remittance shall be restored to the extent of such recovery.

Section 8.7. Indemnification. Each Bank severally (but not
jointly) hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, as well as the
Agent's agents, employees, officers and directors, ratably according to their
respective Percentages from and against any and all losses, liabilities
(including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgment, demands,
damages, costs, disbursements, or expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses)(including allocated costs of in-house counsel)) of any kind or nature
whatsoever, which are imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent or
its agents, employees, officers or directors in any way relating to or arising
out of the Loan Documents, or as a result of any action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Agent; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for any
portion of any such losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties),
actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages, costs disbursements, or expenses
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Loan Documents, the Agent shall in
all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it
shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all
liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

Section 8.8. Agent and Affiliates. Norwest shall have the same
rights and powers in its capacity as a Bank hereunder as any other Bank, and may
exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the Agent,
and Norwest and its affiliates may accept deposits from and generally engage in
any kind of business with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any affiliate of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as fully as if Norwest were not the Agent
hereunder.

Section 8.9. Credit Investigation. Each Bank acknowledges that
it has made such inquiries and taken such care on its own behalf as would have
been the case had its Commitments been granted and its Advances made directly by
such Bank to the Borrower without the intervention of the Agent or any other
Bank. Each Bank agrees and acknowledges that the Agent makes no representations
or warranties about the creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other party to
this Agreement or with respect to the legality, validity, sufficiency or
enforceability of this Agreement, any Loan Document, any Collateral or any other
instrument or document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith.


E-49                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


Section 8.10. Defaults. The Agent shall have no duty to
inquire into any performance or failure to perform by the Borrower and shall not
be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
Default (other than under Sections 7.1(a) or 7.1(b)) hereof unless the Agent has
received notice from a Bank or the Borrower specifying the occurrence of such
Default or Event of Default. In the event that the Agent receives such a notice
of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, the Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Banks. In the event of any Default, the Agent shall
(subject to Section 8.7 hereof) (a) in the case of a Default that constitutes an
Event of Default, not take any the actions referred to in Section 7.2(b) hereof
unless so directed by the Required Banks, and (b) in the case of any Default,
take such actions with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the
Required Banks; provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received
such directions, the Agent may take any action, or refrain from taking any
action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interest of the Banks.

Section 8.11. Obligations Several. The obligations of each
Bank hereunder are the several obligations of such Bank, and neither any Bank
nor the Agent shall be responsible for the obligations of any other Bank
hereunder, nor will the failure by the Agent or any Bank to perform any of its
obligations hereunder relieve the Agent or any other Bank from the performance
of its respective obligations hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement,
and no action taken by any Bank or the Agent pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith or pursuant to or in connection with the Loan Documents shall be deemed
to constitute the Banks, together or with or without the Agent, as a
partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity.

Section 8.12. Sale or Assignment; Addition of Banks. Except as
permitted under the terms and conditions of this Section 8.12 or, with respect
to participations, under Section 8.13, no Bank may sell, assign or transfer its
rights or obligations under this Agreement or its interest in any Note. Any
Bank, at any time upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to
the Agent and the Borrower (unless the Agent and the Borrower consent to a
shorter period of time), may assign all or a portion (provided such portion is
not less than $5,000,000) of such Bank's Notes, Advances, and Commitments to a
domestic or foreign bank (having a branch office in the United States), an
insurance company or other financial institution (an "Applicant") on any date
(the "Adjustment Date") selected by such Bank, but only so long as the Borrower
and the Agent shall have provided their prior written approval of such proposed
Applicant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Borrower will not unreasonably
withhold its consent to any such assignment, (ii) no such consent of the
Borrower shall be required after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, and (iii) no such consent of the Borrower or the Agent shall
be required in connection with an assignment to the Federal Reserve Bank for
purposes of satisfying a Bank's capital requirements. Upon receipt of such
approval and to confirm the status of each additional Bank as a party to this
Agreement and to evidence the assignment in accordance herewith:


E-50                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


(a) the Agent, the Borrower (if the Borrower's consent is
required), the assigning Bank and such Applicant shall, on or before
the Adjustment Date, execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment
Certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit H (an "Assignment
Certificate");

(b) if requested by the Agent, the Borrower will execute and
deliver to the Agent, for delivery by the Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Assignment Certificate, (i) new Notes payable to the order
of the Applicant in amounts corresponding to the applicable Commitments
acquired by such Applicant and (ii) new Notes payable to the order of
the assigning Bank in amounts corresponding to the retained
Commitments. Such new Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be replaced by
such new Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such assignment
and shall otherwise be in the form of the Notes to be replaced thereby.
Such new Notes shall be issued in substitution for, but not in
satisfaction or payment of, the Notes being replaced thereby and such
new Notes shall be treated as Notes for purposes of this Agreement; and

(c) the assigning Bank shall pay to the Agent an
administrative fee of $3,000.

Upon the execution and delivery of such Assignment Certificate and such new
Notes, and effective as of the effective date thereof (i) this Agreement shall
be deemed to be amended to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to
reflect the addition of such additional Bank and the resulting adjustment of the
Percentages arising therefrom, (ii) the assigning Bank shall be relieved of all
obligations hereunder to the extent of the reduction of the assigning Bank's
Percentage, and (iii) the Applicant shall become a party hereto and shall be
entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded to a Bank herein and in
each other Loan Document or other document or instrument executed pursuant
hereto and subject to all obligations of a Bank hereunder, including, without
limitation, the right to approve or disapprove actions which, in accordance with
the terms hereof, require the approval of the Required Banks or all Banks. In
order to facilitate the addition of additional Banks hereto, the Borrower
(subject to is approval rights hereunder, if any) and the Banks shall cooperate
fully with the Agent in connection therewith and shall provide all reasonable
assistance requested by the Agent relating thereto, including, without
limitation, the furnishing of such written materials and financial information
regarding the Borrower as the Agent may reasonably request, the execution of
such documents as the Agent may reasonably request with respect thereto, and the
participation by officers of the Borrower, and the Banks in a meeting or
teleconference call with any Applicant upon the request of the Agent.

Section 8.13. Participation. In addition to the rights granted
in Section 8.12, each Bank may grant participations in all or a portion of its
Notes, Advances and Commitments to any domestic or foreign commercial bank
(having a branch office in the United States), insurance company, financial
institution or an affiliate of such Bank. No


E-51                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


holder of any such participation shall be entitled to require any Bank to take
or omit to take any action hereunder. The Banks shall not, as among the
Borrower, the Agent and the Banks, be relieved of any of their respective
obligations hereunder as a result of any such granting of a participation. The
Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that any participation described in this
Section 8.13 may rely upon, and possess all rights under, any opinions,
certificates, or other instruments or documents delivered under or in connection
with any Loan Document. Except as set forth in this Section 8.13, no Bank may
grant any participation in the Notes, Advances or Commitments.

Section 8.14. Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable
hereunder for the account of any Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under
the laws of the United States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it
will deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of
United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either
case that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the
Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes. Each Bank which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to
deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies of such form
(or a successor form) on or before the date that such form expires (currently,
three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one calendar year for Form
4224) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto
or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or withholding of
any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without
limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the
date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all
such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly completing
and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank advises the
Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any
deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

Section 8.15. Borrower not a Beneficiary or Party. Except with
respect to the limitation of liability applicable to the Banks under Section
8.11 and the Borrower's right to approve additional Banks in accordance with
Section 8.12, the provisions and agreements in this Article VIII are solely
among the Banks and the Agent and the Borrower shall not be considered a party
thereto or a beneficiary thereof.

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure or
delay on the part of the Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or
remedy under the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any


E-52                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or remedy under the Loan Documents. The
remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any
remedies provided by law.

Section 9.2. Amendments, Requested Waivers, Etc. No amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or
consent to any departure by the Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom shall be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Banks
and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the Agent;
provided that no amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent shall
do any of the following unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all
Banks: (a) change the amount of any Commitment (except as permitted in
accordance with Section 8.12), (b) increase the Term Commitment Amount or the
Revolving Commitment Amount, (c) reduce the amount of any principal of or
interest due on any Advances or the Commitment Fees payable to the Banks
hereunder, (d) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of or
interest on any outstanding Advances or the Commitment Fees payable to the Banks
hereunder, (e) change the definition of "Required Banks," (f) amend this Section
9.2 or any other provision of this Agreement requiring the consent or other
action of the Required Banks or all Banks, (g) release any Guaranty or (h)
release, subordinate or terminate any security interest in or mortgage lien on
any Collateral (other than the sale of Inventory in the ordinary course of
business) if the fair market value of all Collateral so affected during any
fiscal year of the Borrower exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate. Any waiver or
consent given hereunder shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in
any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances.

Section 9.3. Addresses for Notices, Etc. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, all notices, requests, demands and other
communications provided for under the Loan Documents shall be in writing and
mailed or delivered to the applicable parties at their respective addresses set
forth on the execution pages hereto, or, as to each party, at such other address
as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party
complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section 9.3. All such notices,
requests, demands and other communications, when delivered, shall be effective
upon actual delivery and when mailed, shall be effective when sent by nationally
recognized overnight mail courier or delivery service, addressed as aforesaid,
except that notices or requests to the Agent or any Bank pursuant to any of the
provisions of Article II shall not be effective until received by the Agent or
such Bank.

Section 9.4. Costs and Expenses. The Borrower will reimburse
the Agent for (a) any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including
without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses (including allocated costs of
in-house counsel), lien and UCC searches, title and recording expenses and other
similar expenses, paid or incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preparation, filing or recording of the Loan Documents and any other


E-53                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


document or agreement related hereto or thereto, and the transactions
contemplated hereby (which amount shall be paid on the Closing Date or as soon
thereafter as demand is made therefor) and the negotiation of any amendments,
modifications or extensions to or of any of the foregoing documents, instruments
or agreements and the preparation of any and all documents necessary or
desirable to effect such amendments, modifications or extensions, (b) customary
transaction fees of the Agent incurred in connection with the loans contemplated
hereby, (c) fees in connection with any audits or inspections by the Agent of
any Collateral or the operations or business of the Borrower and/or its
Subsidiaries, whether conducted at the premises of the Borrower and/or its
Subsidiaries or at the Agent's premises, and (d) any and all other out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower will reimburse the Agent and each
Bank for any and all costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any Bank in
connection with the enforcement of any of the rights or remedies of the Agent or
the Banks under any of the Loan Documents or under applicable law, whether or
not suit is filed with respect thereto.

Section 9.5. Indemnity. In addition to the payment of expenses
pursuant to Section 9.4, the Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Agent, each Bank and each of their respective participants, parent
corporations, subsidiary corporations, affiliated corporations, successor
corporations, and all present and future officers, directors, employees and
agents (the "Indemnitees"), from and against (i) any claim, loss or damage to
which any Indemnitee may be subjected as a result of any past, present or future
existence, use, handling, storage, transportation or disposal of any Hazardous
Substance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any
property owned, leased or controlled by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) any and all transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or charges made
by any governmental authority (excluding income or gross receipts taxes) by
reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or the making of any Advances and (iii) any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses of any
kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel) in connection with any investigative,
administrative or judicial proceedings, whether or not such Indemnitee shall be
designated a party thereto, which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of or in
connection with, the making of any Advances or entering into this Agreement or
any other Loan Documents or the use or intended use of the proceeds of the
Advances, excepting, however, from the foregoing any such liabilities, losses,
damages, penalties, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses resulting
solely from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any Indemnitee. If any
investigative, judicial or administrative proceeding arising from any of the
foregoing is brought against any Indemnitee, upon request of such Indemnitee,
the Borrower, or counsel designated by the Borrower and satisfactory to the
Indemnitee, will resist and defend such action, suit or proceeding to the extent
and in the manner directed by the Indemnitee, at the Borrower's sole cost and
expense. Each Indemnitee will use its best efforts to cooperate in the defense
of any such action, suit or proceeding. If the foregoing


E-54                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless may be held to be
unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, the Borrower shall
nevertheless make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of
each of the indemnified liabilities contemplated hereby which is permissible
under applicable law. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.5
shall survive termination of this Agreement and the discharge of the
Obligations.

Section 9.6. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement and
other Loan Documents may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all
of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
instrument.

Section 9.7. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.

(a) Governing Law. The Loan Documents shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota,
except to the extent the law of any other jurisdiction applies as to
the perfection or enforcement of the any security interest in any
Collateral and except to the extent expressly provided to the contrary
in any Loan Document.

(b) Jurisdiction. The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to
the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
Minnesota in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower
hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such state or federal court.
The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may
effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding. The Borrower irrevocably
consents to the service of copies of the summons and complaint and any
other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding by
the mailing of copies of such process to the Borrower at its addresses
specified in Section 9.3 above. The Borrower agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by law. Nothing in this Section 9.7(b) shall affect the right of the
Agent or any Bank to serve legal process in any other manner permitted
by law or affect the right of the Agent or any Bank to bring any action
or proceeding against the Borrower or its property in the courts of
other jurisdictions.

(c) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE BANKS AND THE
AGENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY
LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED THEREUNDER.


E-55                         Exhibit 10(i)
<PAGE>


Section 9.8. Integration; Inconsistency. This Agreement,
together with the Loan Documents, comprise the final and complete integration of
all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to such subject matter, superseding all prior oral or written
understandings. If any provision of a Loan Document is inconsistent with or
conflicts with a comparable or similar provision appearing in this Agreement,
the comparable or similar provision in this Agreement shall govern.

Section 9.9. Agreement Effectiveness. This Agreement shall
become effective upon delivery of fully executed counterparts hereof to each of
the parties hereto.

Section 9.10. Advice from Independent Counsel. The parties
hereto understand that this Agreement is a legally binding agreement that may
affect such party's rights. Each party hereto represents to the other that it
has received legal advice from counsel of its choice regarding the meaning and
legal significance of this Agreement and that it is satisfied with its legal
counsel and the advice received from it.

Section 9.11. Judicial Interpretation. Should any provision of
this Agreement require judicial interpretation, it is agreed that a court
interpreting or construing the same shall not apply a presumption that the terms
hereof shall be more strictly construed against any person by reason of the rule
of construction that a document is to be construed more strictly against the
person who itself through its agent prepared the same, it being agreed that all
parties hereto have participated in the preparation of this Agreement.

Section 9.12. Binding Effect; No Assignment by Borrower. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the
Banks, the Agent and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
the Borrower may not assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder or
any of its interest herein without the prior written consent of all Banks.

Section 9.13. Severability of Provisions. Any provision of
this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof.

Section 9.14. Headings. Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

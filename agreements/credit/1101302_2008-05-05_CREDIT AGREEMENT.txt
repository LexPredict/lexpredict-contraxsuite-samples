Section 2.6 Refunding of Swing Line Loans.
(a) At any time permitted hereunder, the Borrower may request the Banks to make Revolving Loans
which may be applied to repay the Swing Line Loans outstanding. In all cases, all Swing Line Loans that remain outstanding shall be repaid in full on the fifteenth (15th) and last days of each month. Upon occurrence and during continuance of a Default or Event of Default, the Swing Line Bank may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs the Swing Line Bank to
act on its behalf), upon notice given by the Swing Line Bank no later than 12:00 noon, Minneapolis time, on the relevant refunding date, request each Bank to make, and each Bank hereby agrees to make, a Revolving Loan (which shall be a Base Rate
Advance), in an amount equal to such Bank’s Percentage of the aggregate amount of the Swing Line Loans (the “Refunded Swing Line Loans”) outstanding on the date of such notice, to refund such Swing Line Loans. Each Bank shall
make the amount of such Revolving Loan available to the Agent in immediately available funds, no later than 1:00 p.m., Minneapolis time, on the date of such notice. The proceeds of such Revolving Loans shall be distributed by the Agent to the Swing
Line Bank and immediately applied by the Swing Line Bank to repay the Refunded Swing Line Loans.
(b) If, for any reason, Revolving Loans
may not be (as determined by the Agent in its sole discretion), or are not, made pursuant to Section 2.6(a) to repay Swing Line Loans, then, effective on the date such Revolving Loans would otherwise have been made, each Bank severally,
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that it shall purchase a participating interest in such Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to the amount of Revolving Loans which would otherwise have been made by such Bank pursuant to
Section 2.6(a). Each Bank will immediately transfer to the Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation (the “Swing Line Participation Amount”), and the proceeds of such participation shall be
distributed by the Agent to the Swing Line Bank in such amount as will reduce the amount of the participating interest retained by the Swing Line Bank in its Swing Line Loans.
(c) Whenever, at any time after the Swing Line Bank has received from any Bank such Bank’s Swing Line Participation Amount, the Swing Line Bank
receives any payment on account of the Swing Line Loans, the Swing Line Bank will distribute to such Bank its Swing Line Participation Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such
Bank’s participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such Bank’s pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to pay the principal of
and interest on all Swing Line Loans then due); provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by the Swing Line Bank is required to be returned, such Bank will return to the Swing Line Bank any portion thereof
previously distributed to it by the Swing Line Bank.


15








(d) Each Bank’s obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section 2.6(a) and to
purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
right which such Bank or the Borrower may have against the Swing Line Bank, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the
other conditions precedent specified in Article III; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower or any Bank; or

Commitment to Issue Letters of Credit. The Letter of Credit Bank agrees, from the date of this Agreement (or prior to the date of this Agreement, in the instance of the Existing Letters of Credit) to the date which is thirty (30) days
prior to the Revolving Termination Date, to issue one or more Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, and the Banks agree to participate in the risk of such Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower hereunder, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth below:
(a) The Letter of Credit Bank has issued the Existing Letters of Credit for the for the
account of the Borrower. The Existing Letters of Credit will be deemed “Letters of Credit” for all purposes of this Agreement.
(b) No Letter of Credit shall be issued by the Letter of Credit Bank if, after giving effect to the issuance of such Letter of Credit, (i) the Letter of Credit Obligations shall exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit or (ii) the
Total Outstanding Revolving Amount shall exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount. In addition the Letter of Credit Bank shall not be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit unless the Letter of Credit Bank shall be reasonably satisfied with the form,
substance and beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, and there shall have been no statutory or regulatory change or directive adversely affecting the issuance by the Letter of Credit Bank of letters of credit. The expiration date of any Letter of
Credit shall not be later than (x) one year after the issuance thereof (subject to provisions for annual renewal thereof unless Letter of Credit Bank gives notice of non-renewal), or (y) ten (10) days prior to the Revolving
Termination Date. Each Letter of Credit will be issued promptly after application therefor by the Borrower in accordance with the Letter of Credit Bank’s standard procedures. The application requesting issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be on
the Letter of Credit Bank’s standard form or such other form as may be agreed to by the Letter of Credit Bank and the Borrower, and the Borrower shall enter into any additional agreement respecting issuance of the Letter of Credit as the Letter
of Credit Bank shall request from time to time (each such application and additional agreement is called a “Letter of Credit Agreement”). In the event that any of the terms of such application are inconsistent with the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall govern. The Letter of Credit Bank shall not be obligated to issue a Letter of Credit unless on the date of issuance all applicable conditions precedent specified in Article
III shall have been satisfied as fully as if the issuance of such Letter of Credit were a Revolving Loan. Promptly after issuance of a Letter of Credit pursuant hereto, the Agent shall so advise each Bank of all relevant information with respect
thereto.
(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the pro rata account of all Banks, a commission with respect to each Letter of
Credit (herein the “Letter of Credit Fee”) at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of actual number of days elapsed in a year of three hundred sixty (360) days) equal to the then-Applicable Margin for LIBOR Rate Loans applied to
the face



16









amount of such Letter of Credit, payable quarterly, in arrears, on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, and on drawing or expiry
of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that upon written notice by the Agent from and after the occurrence of an Event of Default and continuing thereafter until such Event of Default shall be remedied to the written satisfaction
of the Required Banks, the applicable Letter of Credit Fee payable hereunder with respect to each Letter of Credit shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Rate Loans, plus (ii) two percent (2%). Letter of Credit
Fees payable by the Borrower to the Banks in accordance with this subsection (c) shall be shared among the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective Percentages.
(d) The Borrower further agrees to pay to the Letter of Credit Bank a fronting fee, payable upon issuance of any Letter of Credit at a rate of
0.125% per annum (computed on the basis of actual number of days elapsed in a year of three hundred sixty (360) days), applied to the face amount of such Letter of Credit, payable in full, in advance upon issuance of any Letter of Credit
or on extension of the expiry thereof. The fee payable by the Borrower to the Letter of Credit Bank in accordance with this subsection (d) shall be retained by the Letter of Credit Bank for its own account.
(e) Upon issuance of a Letter of Credit hereunder, and without any further notice to any Bank, each Bank shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Letter of Credit Bank an undivided participating interest in the Letter of Credit Bank’s risk and obligation under such Letter of Credit and in the obligation of the Letter of Credit Bank to honor
drafts thereunder, and in the amount of any drawing thereunder, and in all rights of the Letter of Credit Bank to obtain reimbursement from the Borrower in the amount of such drawing, and all other rights of the Letter of Credit Bank with respect
thereto, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the sum of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of any drawing thereunder, and (ii) the Percentage of such Bank. Whenever a draft submitted
under a Letter of Credit is paid by the Letter of Credit Bank, the Letter of Credit Bank shall so notify the Agent, the Agent shall so notify each Bank and shall request immediate reimbursement from the Borrower for the amount of the draft. If
sufficient funds are not immediately paid to the Agent by the Borrower, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested Loans pursuant to Section 2.2 and the Banks shall be notified of such request in accordance with
Section 2.2 and shall fund such request for Loans as Base Rate Advances (in accordance with their respective Percentages) for purposes of reimbursing the Letter of Credit Bank for the amount of such draft so paid by the Letter of Credit
Bank (less any amounts realized by the Letter of Credit Bank pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 2.7(e)). If for any reason or under any circumstance (including, without limitation, the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default or the failure to satisfy any of the, conditions set forth in Section 3.2) the Banks do not make such Revolving Loans as contemplated above and the Borrower does not otherwise reimburse the Letter of Credit Bank for the amount of
the draft so paid by the Letter of Credit Bank, the Borrower shall nonetheless be obligated to reimburse the amount of the draft to the Letter of Credit Bank, with interest upon such amount at the Default Rate from and after the date such draft is
paid by the Letter of Credit Bank until the amount thereof is’ repaid to the Letter of Credit Bank in full. If the Letter of Credit Bank shall not have obtained reimbursement for any drawing under a Letter of Credit (whether from the Borrower
or as proceeds of Loans), upon demand of the Agent each Bank shall immediately advance the amount of its participation in such drawing to the Letter of Credit Bank and shall be entitled to interest on such participating interest at the Default Rate
until reimbursed in full by the Borrower.
(f) Each Bank and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the
Letter of Credit Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any



17









sight draft and certificates expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or
the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. The Letter of Credit Bank shall not be liable to any Bank for: (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Banks
(including the Required Banks, as applicable); (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document executed in
connection with a Letter of Credit.
(g) The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee
with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower’s pursuing such rights and remedies as the Borrower may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or
under any other agreement. The Letter of Credit Bank shall not be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) of subsection (h) below. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing:
(i) the Letter of Credit Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation; and (ii) the Letter of Credit Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of
any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

(h) The obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement to reimburse the Letter of Credit Bank for a drawing under a Letter of Credit shall be
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Master Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit or any letter of credit application;
(ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of the Borrower in respect of any
Letter of Credit or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Master Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit or any letter of credit application;
(iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of any
Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Letter of Credit Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or any unrelated
transaction;
(iv) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit;

(v) any payment by the Letter of Credit Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
strictly comply with the terms of any Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Letter of Credit Bank under any Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any insolvency proceeding;


18








(vi) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of
or consent to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of the Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit; or
(vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower.
(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.7 to the contrary, including particularly subsections (g) and
(h) above, the Borrower may have a claim against the Letter of Credit Bank and the Letter of Credit Bank may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary,
damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the Letter of Credit Bank’s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to the Letter of Credit
Bank by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit.
(j) The
Borrower shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee from and against all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments, costs and expenses, including but not limited to all reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal
expenses, incurred by the Indemnitees or imposed upon the Indemnitees at any time by, reason of the issuance, demand for honor or honor of any Letter of Credit or the enforcement, protection or collection of the Letter of Credit Bank’s claims
against the Borrower under this Section 2.7 or by reason of any act or omission of any Indemnitee in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, however, that such indemnification shall not extend to losses, liabilities, claims,
damages, judgments, costs and expenses to the extent arising from any act or omission of an Indemnitee which constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct.
(k) The Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Letter of Credit Bank, on demand, all administrative fees charged by the Letter of Credit Bank in the ordinary course of business in connection with the issuance of letters
of credit, honoring of drafts under letters of credit, amendments thereto, transfers thereof and all other activity with respect to letters of credit, at the then current rates established by the Letter of Credit Bank from time to time for such
services rendered on behalf of customers of the Letter of Credit Bank generally.

Percentages, an unused commitment fee (the “Commitment Fees”) computed at the rate of the then-Applicable Commitment Fee Rate per annum on the daily average amount by which the Revolving Commitment Amount exceeds the sum of the Revolving
Loans outstanding and the Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding (with the Swing Line Loans not deemed usage for this purpose), from the date of this Agreement to and including the Revolving Termination Date, payable quarterly in arrears on the

Section 2.13. Reduction or Termination of the Revolving Commitments; Increase of Revolving Commitment; Prepayments.
(a) Reduction or Termination of Revolving Commitments. The Borrower, from time to time upon not less than three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Agent, may:
(i) permanently reduce the Revolving Commitment Amount to an amount not less than the Total Outstanding Revolving Amount, which reduction shall be pro
rata as to all Revolving Commitments according to each Bank’s Revolving Percentage and shall be in an aggregate amount equal to $5,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $1,000,000; or
(ii) if there are no Total Outstanding Revolving Amounts and the Borrower shall concurrently pay all other Obligations, terminate the Revolving
Commitments.
(b) Increase of Revolving Commitments and Revolving Commitment Amount. The Borrower may at any time prior to the
Revolving Termination Date, on the terms set forth below, request that the Revolving Commitment Amount be increased by an amount not to exceed $20,000,000 to a total amount of not more than $250,000,000; provided, however, that an
increase in the Revolving Commitment Amount hereunder may only be made at a time when no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and provided, further, that any request for an increase shall be in a minimum
amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 above such amount. In the event of such a requested increase in the Revolving Commitment Amount, any financial institution which the Borrower and the Agent invite to become a Bank or to
increase its Revolving Commitment may set the amount of its Revolving Commitment at a level agreed to by the Borrower and the Agent. In the event that the Borrower and one or more of the Banks (or other financial institutions) shall agree upon such
an increase in the Revolving Commitment Amount, the Borrower, the Agent and each Bank or other financial institution increasing its Revolving Commitment or extending a new Revolving Commitment shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement setting
forth the amounts of the Revolving Commitment of such Bank or other financial institution and the Revolving Commitment Amount, as so increased, setting forth the revised Revolving Percentages of all Banks, and providing that the financial
institutions extending new Revolving Commitments shall be Banks for all purposes under this Agreement. No such amendment shall require the approval or consent of any Bank whose Revolving Commitment is not being increased. Upon the execution and
delivery of such amendment as provided above, and upon satisfaction of such other conditions as the Agent may reasonably specify upon the request of the financial institutions that are extending new Revolving Commitments, this Agreement shall be
deemed to be amended accordingly. Upon amendment and increase as provided in this Section 2.13(b), the Agent and the Banks shall use best efforts to cause the financial institutions that are extending new Revolving Commitments to fund
their Revolving Percentage of the outstanding Loans in a manner that would not cause any LIBOR Rate Advance to be required to be prepaid to any Bank prior to the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and in so doing, may delay, for
periods reasonably chosen by the Agent, adjustment of respective holdings by the Banks of the Loans to coincide with the last day of applicable Interest Periods. In no instance shall the Borrower request more than two (2) increases under this
Section 2.13(b).


21








(c) Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower from time to time may voluntarily prepay the Revolving
Notes in whole or in part subject to the following:
(i) any prepayment of the Revolving Loans shall be applied against outstanding
Revolving Loans of each Bank pro rata according to each Bank’s Revolving Percentage;
(ii) such prepayments shall be made to the Agent
not later than 12:00 Noon, Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on a Business Day, and funds received after that hour shall be deemed to have been received by the Agent on the next following Business Day;
(iii) each partial prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Advance shall be accompanied by accrued interest on such partial prepayment through the date of prepayment
and additional compensation calculated in accordance with Section 2.17;
(iv) the Borrower shall give prior notice to the Agent
of prepayment of any Base Rate Advance no later than 12:00 noon, Minneapolis, Minnesota, time on the date of payment;
(v) the Borrower
shall give prior notice to the Agent of prepayment of any LIBOR Rate Advance no later than 12:00 noon, Minneapolis, Minnesota, time three (3) Business Days’ prior to the date of prepayment;
(vi) each partial prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Advance, shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable minimum funding amounts for LIBOR Rate
Advances specified in Section 2.2 (or if less, the full amount of such LIBOR Rate Advance), and, after application of any such prepayment, shall not result in a LIBOR Rate Advance remaining outstanding in an amount less than such minimum
funding amount; and
(vii) each partial prepayment of a Base Rate Advance shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable minimum
funding amounts for Base Rate Advances specified in Section 2.2 (or if less, the full amount of such Base Rate Advance), and, after application of any such prepayment, shall not result in a Base Rate Advance remaining outstanding in an
amount less than such minimum funding amount.
Section 2.14. Payments.
(a) Making of Payments. All payments of principal of and interest due shall be made to the Agent for the account of the Banks pro rata according to
their respective Percentages, except for payment of interest and principal of Swing Line Loans prior to refunding thereof or the funding by the Banks of their participation therein. All payments to the Agent shall be made to the Agent at its office
in Minneapolis, Minnesota, not later than 12:00 Noon, Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on the date due, in immediately available funds, and funds received after that hour shall be deemed to have been received by the Agent on the next following Business
Day. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent to charge the Borrower’s demand deposit accounts maintained with the Agent (or with any other Bank) for the amount of any Obligation on its due date, but the Agent’s failure to so charge any
such account shall in no way affect the obligation of the Borrower to make any such payment. The Agent shall remit to each Bank in immediately available funds on the same Business Day as received by the Agent its share of all such payments received
by the Agent for the account of such Bank. If the Agent fails to remit any payment to any Bank when required hereby, the Agent shall pay interest on demand to that Bank for each day during the period commencing on the date such remittance was due
until the date such remittance is made at an annual rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day. All payments under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 shall be made by the Borrower directly to the Bank entitled thereto.



22








(b) Effect of Payments. Each payment by the Borrower to the Agent for the account of any Bank
pursuant to Section 2.14(a) shall be deemed to constitute payment by the Borrower directly to such Bank, provided, however, that in the event any such payment by the Borrower to the Agent is required to be returned to the
Borrower for any reason whatsoever, then the Borrower’s obligation to such Bank with respect to such payment shall be deemed to be automatically reinstated.
(c) Distributions by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have been notified by a Bank or the Borrower prior to the date on which such Bank or the Borrower are scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (in the case of
a Bank) the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it hereunder or (in the case of the Borrower) a payment to the Agent for the account of one or more of the Banks hereunder (such payment by a Bank or the Borrower (as the case may be) being herein called
a “Required Payment”), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that it does not intend to make the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption
(but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient(s) on such date and, if such Bank or the Borrower (as the case may be) has not in fact made the Required Payment to the Agent, the recipient(s) of such
payment shall, on demand, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon for each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such
amount at a rate (i) equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day, in the case of a Required Payment owing by a Bank, or (ii) equal to the applicable rate of interest as provided in this Agreement, in the case of a Required Payment owing
by the Borrower.
(d) Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each Bank, subject to such Bank’s sharing obligations set forth in
Section 8.6, shall have all rights of setoff and bankers’ lien provided by applicable law, and in addition thereto, the Borrower agrees that if at any time any Obligation is due and owing by the Borrower under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents to any Bank at a time when an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing hereunder, any Bank may apply any and all balances, credits, and deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrower then or thereafter in the possession of
such Bank (excluding, however, any trust or escrow accounts held by the Borrower for the benefit of any third party) to the payment thereof.
(e) Due Date Extension. If any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees payable hereunder falls due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next following Business Day
(subject, in the case of LIBOR Rate Advances, to the definition of “Interest Period”), and (in the case of principal) additional interest shall accrue and be payable for the period of such extension.
(f) Application of Payments. Except as otherwise provided herein, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
hereunder, each payment received from the Borrower shall be applied to such Obligation as the Borrower shall specify by notice to be received by the Agent on or before the date of such payment, or in the absence of such notice, as the Agent shall
determine in its discretion. Concurrently with each remittance to any Bank of its appropriate share of any such payment (based upon such Bank’s Percentage), the Agent shall advise such Bank as to the application of such payment. Except as
otherwise provided in Article VIII, after the termination of the Revolving Commitments following the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, all payments received by the Agent or any Bank from the Borrower shall be shared on the basis of
each Bank’s Percentage thereof.


23








Section 2.15. Taxes. All payments made by the Borrower to the Agent or any Bank (herein any
“Payee”) under or in connection with this Agreement or the Revolving Notes shall be made without any setoff or other counterclaim, and shall be free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or
future taxes now or hereafter imposed by any governmental or other authority, except to the extent that any such deduction or withholding is compelled by law. As used herein, the term “Taxes” shall include all income, excise and other
taxes of whatever nature (other than taxes generally assessed on the overall net income of a Payee by the government or other authority of the country, state or political subdivision in which such Payee is incorporated or in which the office through
which such Payee is acting is located) as well as all levies, imposts, duties, charges, or fees of whatever nature. “Taxes” shall not include, however, any foreign withholding taxes or similar deductions imposed solely as a result of a
Bank’s election to fund an Advance through a foreign office of such Bank or due to the failure of any Bank to file applicable tax withholding or exemption forms. If the Borrower is compelled by law to make any deductions or withholdings on
account of any Taxes (including any foreign withholding) the Borrower will:
(a) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to
be so withheld or deducted;
(b) pay such additional amounts (including, without limitation, any penalties, interest or expenses) as may be
necessary in order that the net amount received by the Payee after such deductions or withholdings (including any required deduction or withholding on such additional amounts) shall equal the amount the Payee would have received had no such
deductions or withholdings been made; and
(c) promptly forward to the Agent (for delivery to the appropriate Payee) an official receipt or
other documentation satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment to such authorities.
The amount that the Borrower shall be required to pay to any
Payee pursuant to the foregoing clause (b) shall be reduced, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by the amount of any offsetting tax benefit which such Payee receives as the result of the Borrower’s payment to the relevant
authorities as reasonably determined by such Payee; provided, however, that if such Payee shall subsequently determine that it has lost the benefit of all or a portion of such tax benefit, the Borrower shall promptly remit to such
Payee the amount certified by such Payee to be the amount necessary to restore such Payee to the position it would have been in if no payment had been made pursuant to this sentence. If any Taxes otherwise payable by the Borrower pursuant to the
foregoing are directly asserted against a Payee, such Payee may pay such taxes and the Borrower promptly shall reimburse such Payee to the full extent otherwise required under this Section 2.15. The obligations of the Borrower under this
Section 2.15 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
If circumstances arise in respect of any Bank which would, or
would upon the giving of notice, result in any liability of the Borrower under this Section 2.15 then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the Borrower’s obligations under this Section 2.15 such
Bank shall promptly, upon becoming aware of the same, notify the Agent and the Borrower thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Borrower and to the extent that it can do so without, in its reasonable judgment, disadvantaging
itself, take such reasonable steps as may be available to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, the designation of an alternate office or the transfer of its LIBOR Rate Advances to another office). If and
so long as a Bank has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps reasonably acceptable to the Borrower to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in question, such Bank shall be obliged, at the request of the Borrower, to assign all its rights
and obligations



24









hereunder to another Person designated by the Borrower with the approval of the Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) which is willing to enter
this Agreement in place of such Bank; provided that such Person satisfies all of the requirements of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, providing the forms and documents required by Section 8.14 and any such Person shall
cover all costs incurred in connection with effecting such replacement.
Section 2.16. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy; Funding
Exceptions.
(a) Increased Costs on LIBOR Rate Advances. If Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
or after the date of this Agreement the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any existing law, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by a Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall:
(i) subject a Bank to or cause the withdrawal or termination of any exemption previously granted to a Bank with respect to, any tax, duty or other charge
with respect to its LIBOR Rate Advances or its obligation to make LIBOR Rate Advances, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to a Bank of the principal of or interest under this Agreement in respect of its LIBOR Rate Advances or its
obligation to make LIBOR Rate Advances (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of a Bank imposed by the jurisdictions in which a Bank’s principal executive office is located), or
(ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, but excluding any reserve included in the determination of interest rates pursuant to Section 2.5), special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, a Bank; or

(iii) impose on a Bank any other condition affecting its making, maintaining or funding of its LIBOR Rate Advances or its obligation to
make LIBOR Rate Advances;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to an affected Bank of making or maintaining any
LIBOR Rate Advance, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank under this Agreement or under its Revolving Note with respect to a LIBOR Rate Advance, then the affected Bank will notify the Borrower and the Agent of such
increased cost and within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Bank (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the basis of such demand) the Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate the Bank for such increased cost or such reduction; provided, however, that no such increased cost or such reduction shall be payable by the Borrower for any period longer than ninety (90) days prior to the date on
which notice thereof is delivered to the Borrower. Each Bank will promptly notify the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this
Section 2.15. If the Borrower receives notice from a Bank of any event which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 the Borrower may prepay any then outstanding LIBOR Rate Advances or notify the
affected Bank that any pending request for a LIBOR Rate Advance shall be deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Advance, in each case subject to the provisions of Section 2.16.


25








(b) Capital Adequacy. If a Bank determines at any time that such Bank’s Return has been
reduced as a result of any Capital Adequacy Rule Change, such Bank may require the Borrower to pay to such Bank the amount necessary to restore such Bank’s Return to what it would have been had there been no Capital Adequacy Rule Change. For
purposes of this Section 2.16(b), the following definitions shall apply:
(i) “Return”, for any calendar
quarter or shorter period, means the percentage determined by dividing (A) the sum of interest and ongoing fees earned by a Bank under this Agreement during such period by (B) the average capital such Bank is required to maintain during
such period as a result of its being a party to this Agreement, as determined by such Bank based upon its total capital requirements and a reasonable attribution formula that takes account of the Capital Adequacy Rules then in effect. Return may be
calculated for a Bank for each calendar quarter and for the shorter period between the end of a calendar quarter and the date of termination in whole of this Agreement.
(ii) “Capital Adequacy Rule” means any law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy that applies to a Bank, or the interpretation thereof by any governmental or regulatory authority.
Capital Adequacy Rules include rules requiring financial institutions to maintain total capital in amounts based upon percentages of outstanding loans, binding loan commitments and letters of credit.
(iii) “Capital Adequacy Rule Change” means any change in any Capital Adequacy Rule occurring after the date of this Agreement, but does
not include any changes in applicable requirements that at the date hereof are scheduled to take place under the existing Capital Adequacy Rules or any increases in the capital that a Bank is required to maintain to the extent that the increases are
required due to a regulatory authority’s assessment of such Bank’s financial condition.
The initial notice sent by a Bank shall
be sent as promptly as practicable after such Bank learns that its Return has been reduced, shall include a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore such Bank’s Return for the quarter in which the notice is sent, and shall state in
reasonable detail the cause for the reduction in such Bank’s Return and such Bank’s calculation of the amount of such reduction. Thereafter, a Bank may send a new notice during each calendar quarter setting forth the calculation of the
reduced Return for that quarter and including a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore such Bank’s Return for that quarter. A Bank’s calculation in any such notice shall be conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error.

(c) Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. If with respect to any Interest Period:
(i) the Agent determines that, or the Required Banks determine and advise the Agent that, deposits in U.S. dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not
being offered in the London interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period; or
(ii) the Agent otherwise determines, or the Required
Banks determine and advise the Agent (which determination shall be binding and conclusive on all parties), that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank eurodollar market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
the applicable LIBOR Rate; or


26








(iii) the Agent determines, or the Required Banks determine and advise the Agent, that the LIBOR Rate as
determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Banks of maintaining or funding a LIBOR Rate Advance for such Interest Period, or that the making or funding of LIBOR Rate Advances has become impracticable as a result
of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement which in the opinion of such Banks materially affects such LIBOR Rate Advances;
then the Agent shall promptly notify the affected parties and (A) in the event of any occurrence described in the foregoing clause (i) the Borrower shall enter into good faith negotiations with each affected Bank in order
to determine an alternate method to determine the LIBOR Rate for such Bank, and during the pendency of such negotiations with any Bank, such Bank shall be under no obligation to make any new LIBOR Rate Advances, and (B) in the event of any
occurrence described in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), for so long as such circumstances shall continue, no Bank shall be under any obligation to make any new LIBOR Rate Advances.
(d) Illegality. In the event that any change in (including the adoption of any new) applicable laws or regulations, or any change in the
interpretation of applicable laws or regulations by any governmental authority, central bank, comparable agency or any other regulatory body charged with the interpretation, implementation or administration thereof, or compliance by a Bank with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank, comparable agency or other regulatory body, should make it or, in the good faith judgment of the affected Bank, shall raise a substantial question as
to whether it is unlawful for such Bank to make, maintain or fund LIBOR Rate Advances, then (i) the affected Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent, (ii) the obligation of the affected Bank to make, maintain or convert into
LIBOR Rate Advances shall, upon the effectiveness of such event, be suspended for the duration of such unlawfulness, and (iii) for the duration of such unlawfulness, any notice by the Borrower pursuant to Sections 2.3, 2.4 or
2.5 requesting the affected Bank to make or convert into LIBOR Rate Advances shall be construed as a request to make or to continue making Base Rate Advances.
(e) Procedures to Mitigate. If circumstances arise in respect of any Bank which would or would upon the giving of notice result in any liability of the Borrower under Section 2.15 or this
Section 2.16 then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the Borrower’s obligations under Section 2.15 or this Section 2.16, such Bank shall promptly, upon becoming aware of the same,
notify the Agent and the Borrower thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Borrower and to the extent that it can do so without, in its reasonable judgment, disadvantaging itself, take such reasonable steps as may be available to it
to mitigate the effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, the designation of an alternate office or the transfer of its LIBOR Rate Advances to another office). If and so long as a Bank has been unable to take, or has not taken,
steps reasonably acceptable to the Borrower to mitigate the effect of the circumstances in question, such Bank shall be obliged, at the request of the Borrower, to assign all its rights and obligations hereunder to another Person designated by the
Borrower with the approval of the Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and willing to enter this Agreement in place of such Bank; provided that such Person satisfies all of the requirements of this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, providing the forms and documents required by Section 8.14 and any such Person shall cover all costs incurred in connection with effecting such replacement.
Section 2.17. Funding Losses. The Borrower hereby agrees that upon demand by any Bank (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement
setting forth the basis for the calculations of the amount being claimed) the Borrower will indemnify such Bank against any loss (other than loss of



27









Applicable Margin) or expense which such Bank may have sustained or incurred (including, without limitation, any net loss or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Advances) or which such Bank may be deemed to have sustained or incurred, as reasonably determined by such Bank, (i) as a
consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with any LIBOR Rate Advances, (ii) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow or convert any LIBOR Rate Advances on a date
specified therefor in a notice thereof or (iii) due to any payment or prepayment of any LIBOR Rate Advance on a date other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Advance. For this purpose, all notices under
Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 shall be deemed to be irrevocable.
Section 2.18. Right of Banks to Fund through
Other Offices. Each Bank, if it so elects, may fulfill its agreements hereunder with respect to any LIBOR Rate Advance by causing a foreign branch or affiliate of such Bank to make such LIBOR Rate Advance; provided, that in such event the
obligation of the Borrower to repay such LIBOR Rate Advance shall nevertheless be to such Bank and such LIBOR Rate Advance shall be deemed held by such Bank for the account of such branch or affiliate.
Section 2.19. Discretion of Banks as to Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Bank shall
be entitled to fund and maintain all or any part of its LIBOR Rate Advances in any manner it deems fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement (specifically including, without limitation, Section 2.17
hereof) all determinations hereunder shall be made as if each Bank had actually funded and maintained each LIBOR Rate Advance during each Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Advance through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to
such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the appropriate LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period.
Section 2.20.
Conclusiveness of Statements; Survival of Provisions. Determinations and statements of a Bank pursuant to Section 2.15, 2.16, or 2.17 shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. Each Bank may use reasonable
averaging and attribution methods in determining compensation pursuant to such Sections 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 and the provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Section 7.2. Rights and Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default until such Event of Default is cured or waived to the written
satisfaction of the Required Banks, the Agent may (and, upon written request of the Required Banks the Agent shall) exercise any or all of the following rights and remedies:
(a) by notice to the Borrower, declare the Revolving Commitments to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate;
(b) by notice to the Borrower, declare the entire unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Notes, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other
Obligations to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Revolving Notes, all such accrued interest and all such other Obligations shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower;
(c) without notice to the Borrower and without further action, apply any and all
monies owing by any Bank to the Borrower or to any of its Subsidiaries to the payment of the Revolving Notes, including interest accrued thereon, and to payment to payment of all other Obligations then owing by the Borrower;
(d) exercise and enforce the rights and remedies available to the Agent, the Banks or to any Bank under any Loan Document; and
(e) exercise any other rights and remedies available to the Agent, the Banks or to any Bank by law or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 7.1(f) or (g) hereof, the entire unpaid principal
amount of the Loans and Notes, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts payable under this Agreement shall be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind.
Section 7.3 Letters of Credit. In addition to the foregoing remedies, if any Event of Default described in Sections 7.1(f) or
(g) shall occur, or if any other Event of Default shall have occurred and the Agent shall have declared that the principal balance of the Notes is due and payable, the Borrower shall, upon demand by the Agent (which demand the Agent may
make at its discretion and shall make upon written request of the Required Banks), pay to the Agent, as agent and bailee for the Banks, an amount equal to all Letter of Credit Obligations. Such payment shall be in immediately available funds or in
similar cash collateral acceptable to the Agent and shall be pledged to the Agent as agent and bailee for the benefit of the Banks. Such amount shall be held by the Agent in a cash collateral account until the outstanding Letters of Credit are
terminated without payment or are paid and Letter of Credit Obligations with respect thereto are payable. In the event the Borrower defaults in the payment of any Letter of Credit Obligations, the proceeds of the cash collateral account shall be
applied to the payment thereof. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Agent and the Banks shall have the right to require the Borrower to perform specifically such undertaking whether or not any of the Letter of Credit Obligations are due
and payable. Upon the failure of the Borrower to make any payment required under this Section 7.3, the Agent, on behalf of the Banks, may proceed to use all remedies available at law or equity to enforce the obligation of the Borrower to
pay or reimburse the Banks, including without limitation any



42









right the Agent or Banks may have to enforce any security interest in any collateral for such obligations. The balance of any payment due under this
Section 7.3 shall bear interest payable on demand until paid in full at a per annum rate equal to interest rate then applicable to the Loans.
ARTICLE VIII
AGREEMENT AMONG BANKS AND AGENT
Section 8.1. Authorization; Powers. Each Bank irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as administrative agent for and on behalf
of such Bank to the extent provided herein, in any Loan Documents (including by way of acting as “Secured Party” under the Pledge Agreements) or in any other document or instrument delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, and to take
such other actions as may be reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent agrees to act as administrative agent for each Bank upon the express conditions contained in this Article VIII, but in no event shall the Agent constitute a fiduciary of
any Bank, nor shall the Agent have any fiduciary responsibilities in respect of any Bank. In furtherance of the foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, each Bank irrevocably (a) authorizes the Agent to execute and deliver and perform those
obligations under each of the Loan Documents to which the Agent is a party as are specifically delegated to the Agent, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies as may be specifically delegated hereunder or thereunder, together with such
additional powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto, (b) appoints the Agent as nominal beneficiary or nominal secured party, as the case may be, under the Loan Documents and all related UCC financing statements (if and to the extent
collateral security is granted with respect to the Obligations), and (c) authorizes the Agent to act as agent of and for such Bank for purposes of holding, perfecting and disposing of collateral under the Loan Documents (if and to the extent
collateral security is granted with respect to the Obligations). As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents, the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to
refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Banks or, if so required pursuant to Section 9.2, upon the instructions of all Banks; provided,
however, that except for action expressly required of the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and
all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action, and the Agent shall not in any event be required to take any action which is contrary to the Loan Documents or applicable law.

Section 8.2. Application of Proceeds. The Agent, after deduction of any costs of collection, as provided in
Section 8.5, shall remit to each Bank (to the extent a Bank is to share therein) that Bank’s pro rata share of all payments of principal, interest and fees payable hereunder in accordance with such Bank’s appropriate
Percentage. Each Bank’s interest under the Loan Documents shall be payable solely from payments, collections and proceeds actually received by the Agent under the Loan Documents; and the Agent’s only liability to a Bank with respect to any
such payments, collections and proceeds shall be to account for such Bank’s Percentage of such payments, collections and proceeds in accordance with this Agreement. If the Agent is required for any reason to refund any such payments,
collections or proceeds, each Bank will refund to the Agent, upon demand, its Percentage of such payments, collections or proceeds, together with its Percentage of interest or penalties, if any, payable by the Agent in connection with such refund.
If any Bank has wrongfully refused to fund its Percentage of any Loans, or if the outstanding principal balance of the Loans made by any Bank is for any other reason less than its respective Percentage of the aggregate principal balance of all Loans
(except Swing Line Loans), the Agent may remit payments received by it to the other Banks until such payments have reduced the aggregate amounts owed by the Borrower to the extent that the aggregate amount of the Loans owing to such Bank hereunder
are equal to its Percentage of the aggregate amounts of the Loans owing to all of the Banks hereunder. The foregoing provision is intended only to set forth certain rules for the application of payments, proceeds and collections in the event that a
Bank has breached its obligations hereunder and shall not be deemed to excuse any Bank from such obligations.


43








Section 8.3. Exculpation. The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Agent in connection with the Loan Documents, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning legal matters, the advice of independent public accountants
with respect to accounting matters and advice of other experts as to any other matters and upon any Loan Document and any schedule, certificate, statement, report, notice or other writing which it reasonably believes to be genuine or to have been
presented by a proper Person. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall be responsible or in any way liable for (a) any recitals, representations or warranties contained in, or for the execution, validity,
genuineness, effectiveness or enforceability of any Loan Document, or any other instrument or document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (b) the validity, genuineness, perfection, effectiveness, enforceability, existence, value of
enforcement of any collateral (if and to the extent collateral security is granted with respect to the Obligations) or (c) any action taken or omitted by it. The designation of Wells Fargo as Agent hereunder shall in no way impair or affect any
of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, Wells Fargo in its individual capacity as Bank hereunder.
Section 8.4. Use of the Term “Agent”. The term “Agent” is used herein in reference to the Agent merely as a matter of custom. It is intended to reflect only an administrative relationship between the Agent
and the Banks, in each case as independent contracting parties. However, the obligations of the Agent shall be limited to those expressly set forth herein and in no event shall the use of such term create or imply any fiduciary relationship or any
other obligation arising under the general law of agency.
Section 8.5. Reimbursement for Costs and Expenses. All payments,
collections and proceeds received or effected by the Agent may be applied first to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable costs and expenses at any time incurred by or imposed upon the Agent in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document (including but not limited to all reasonable attorney’s fees), foreclosure expenses and advances made to protect the security of any collateral (if and to the extent collateral security is granted with respect to the Obligations), but
excluding any costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent. If the Agent does not receive payments, collections or proceeds sufficient to cover any such costs and expenses within five
(5) days after their incurrence or imposition, each Bank shall, upon demand, remit to the Agent such Bank’s Percentage of the difference between (i) such costs and expenses and (ii) such payments, collections and proceeds,
together with interest on such amount for each day following the thirtieth day after demand therefor until so remitted at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate for each such day.
Section 8.6. Payments Received Directly by Banks. If any Bank shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by
application of offset or otherwise) on account of any Loan or on account of any fees under this Agreement (other than through distributions made in accordance with Section 8.2 hereof) in excess of such Bank’s applicable Percentage
with respect to the Loan, such Bank shall promptly give notice of such fact to the Agent and shall promptly remit to the Agent such amount as shall be necessary to cause the remitting Bank to share such excess payment or other recovery ratably with
each of the Banks in accordance with their respective Percentages, together with interest for each day on such amount until so remitted at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate for each such day; provided, however, that if all or any
portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such remitting Bank or holder, the remittance shall be restored to the extent of such recovery.


44








Section 8.7. Indemnification. Each Bank severally, but not jointly, hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, as well as the Agent’s agents, employees; officers and directors, ratably according to their respective Percentages from and against any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties),
actions, suits, judgment, demands, damages, costs, disbursements, or expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses, and costs of in-house counsel) of any kind or nature whatsoever, which are imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the
Agent or its agents, employees, officers or directors in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, or as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable
for any portion of any such losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages, costs disbursements, or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Loan Documents, the Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and
expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
Section 8.8. Agent and
Affiliates. Wells Fargo shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Bank hereunder as any other Bank, and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the Agent, and Wells Fargo and its affiliates may
accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any affiliate of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as fully as if Wells Fargo were not the Agent hereunder.
Section 8.9. Credit Investigation. Each Bank acknowledges that it has made such inquiries and taken such care on its own behalf as would have
been the case had its Revolving Commitment been granted and its Loans made directly by such Bank to the Borrower without the intervention of the Agent or any other Bank. Each Bank agrees and acknowledges that the Agent makes no representations or
warranties about the creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other party to this Agreement or with respect to the legality, validity, sufficiency or enforceability of this Agreement, any Loan Document or any other instrument or document delivered
hereunder or in connection herewith.
Section 8.10. Defaults. The Agent shall have no duty to inquire into any performance or
failure to perform by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default (other than under Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b) or 7.1(c)) hereof unless the Agent
has received notice from a Bank or the Borrower specifying the occurrence of such Default or Event of Default. In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, the Agent shall give prompt
notice thereof to the Banks. In the event of any Default, the Agent shall (subject to Section 8.7 hereof) (a) in the case of a Default that constitutes an Event of Default, not take any of the actions referred to in
Section 7.2(b) hereof unless so directed by the Required Banks, and (b) in the case of any Default, take such actions with respect to such Default as shall be directed by the Required Banks; provided that, unless and until
the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may take any action, or refrain from taking any action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Banks.
Section 8.11. Obligations Several. The obligations of each Bank hereunder are the several obligations of such Bank, and neither any Bank nor
the Agent shall be responsible for the obligations of any other Bank hereunder, nor will the failure by the Agent or any Bank to perform any of its obligations hereunder relieve the Agent or any other Bank from the performance of its respective
obligations hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken by any Bank or the Agent pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or pursuant to or in connection with the Loan Documents shall be deemed to constitute the Banks,
together or with or without the Agent, as a partnership, association, joint venture, or other entity.


45








Section 8.12. Sale or Assignment; Addition of Banks. Except as permitted under the terms and
conditions of this Section 8.12 or, with respect to participations, under Section 8.13, no Bank may sell, assign or transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement or its interest in any Revolving Note. Any Bank, at
any time upon at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Agent and the Borrower (unless the Agent and the Borrower consent to a shorter period of time), may assign all or a portion (provided such portion is not less than
$10,000,000) of such Bank’s Revolving Note, Loans and Revolving Commitment to a domestic or foreign bank (having a branch office in the United States), an insurance company or other financial institution (an “Applicant”) on any
date (the “Adjustment Date”) selected by such Bank, but only so long as the Borrower and the Agent shall have provided their prior written approval of such proposed Applicant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Borrower and
the Agent will not unreasonably withhold its consent to any such assignment, (ii) no such consent of the Borrower, shall be required after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and (iii) no such consent of the
Borrower or the Agent shall be required in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an Affiliate of a Bank. Upon receipt of such approval and to confirm the status of each additional Bank as a party to this Agreement and to evidence the assignment in
accordance herewith:
(a) the Agent, the Borrower (if the Borrower’s consent is required), the assigning Bank and such Applicant shall,
on or before the Adjustment Date, execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment Certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit H (an “Assignment Certificate”);
(b) if requested by the Agent, the Borrower will execute and deliver to the Agent, for delivery by the Agent in accordance with the terms of the
Assignment Certificate, (i) a new Revolving Note payable to the order of the Applicant in the amount corresponding to the applicable Revolving Commitment acquired by such Applicant and (ii) a new Revolving Note payable to the order of the
assigning Bank in the amount corresponding to the retained Revolving Commitment. Such new Revolving Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Revolving Notes to be replaced by such new Revolving Notes,
shall be dated the effective date of such assignment and shall otherwise be in the form of the Revolving Note to be replaced thereby. Such new Revolving Notes shall be issued in substitution for, but not in satisfaction or payment of, the Revolving
Note being replaced thereby and such new Revolving Notes shall be treated as Revolving Notes for purposes of this Agreement; and
(c) the
assigning Bank shall pay to the Agent an administrative fee of $3,000.
Upon the execution and delivery of such Assignment Certificate and such new
Revolving Notes, and effective as of the effective date thereof (i) this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such additional Bank and the resulting adjustment of
the Percentages arising therefrom, (ii) the assigning Bank shall be relieved of all obligations hereunder to the extent of the reduction of the assigning Bank’s Percentage, and (iii) the Applicant shall become a party hereto and shall
be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded to a Bank herein and in each other Loan Document or other document or instrument executed pursuant hereto and subject to all obligations of a Bank hereunder, including, without limitation,
the right to approve or disapprove actions which, in accordance with the terms hereof, require the approval of the Required Banks or all Banks. In order to facilitate the addition of additional Banks hereto, the Borrower (subject to their approval
rights hereunder, if any) and the Banks shall cooperate fully with the Agent in connection therewith and shall provide all reasonable assistance requested by the Agent relating thereto, including, without limitation, the furnishing of such written
materials and financial information regarding the Borrower as the Agent may reasonably request, the execution of such documents as the Agent may reasonably request with respect thereto, and the participation by officers of the Borrower and the Banks
at reasonable times and places in a meeting or teleconference call with any Applicant upon the reasonable request of the Agent.


46








Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Bank may at any time or from time to time (without the consent of the
Agent or Borrower) pledge or assign a security interest in all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under the Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure its obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto.
Section 8.13. Participation. In addition to the rights granted in Section 8.12, each Bank may grant participations in all or a
portion of its Revolving Note, Loans and Revolving Commitment to any domestic or foreign commercial bank (having a branch office in the United States), insurance company, financial institution or an affiliate of such Bank. No holder of any such
participation shall be entitled to require any Bank to take or omit to take any action hereunder, except that a Bank selling a participation may agree with the participant that such Bank will not, without such participant’s consent, take any
action which would, in the case of any principal, interest, Letter of Credit or fee in which the participant has an ownership or beneficial interest: (a) extend the final maturity of any Loans or extend the Revolving Termination Date,
(b) reduce the interest rate on the Loans or the rate of Commitment Fees or Letter of Credit Fees, (c) forgive any principal of, or interest on, the Loans, any reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit or any fees, or
(d) release all or substantially all of any collateral for the Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations. The Banks shall not, as among the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks, be relieved of any of their respective obligations hereunder as a result
of any such granting of a participation. The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that any participation described in this Section 8.13 may rely upon, and possess all rights under, any opinions, certificates, or other instruments or
documents delivered under or in connection with any Loan Document. Except as set forth in this Section 8.13, no Bank may grant any participation in its Revolving Note, Loans or Revolving Commitment.
Section 8.14. Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable
hereunder for the account of any Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United States
Internal Revenue Service Form W8BEN or W8ECI, certifying in either case that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Revolving Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Bank
which so delivers a Form W8BEN or W8ECI further undertakes to deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of
any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement and the Revolving Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to
the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Bank advises the Borrower and
the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.
Section
8.15 Agent’s Counsel. In connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Document, perfecting any security interest, completing any filings or registrations and in connection with future legal
representation relating to loan administration, amendments, modifications, waivers, forbearance or enforcement of remedies, Briggs and Morgan, Professional Association or any other law firm engaged by Wells Fargo (the “Wells Firm”)
has only represented and shall



47









only represent Wells Fargo, in its capacity as Agent and as a Bank. The Borrower and each other Bank hereby acknowledges, and each Assignee and Participant
(by accepting an Assignment or a Participation, as provided in Sections 8.12 and 8.13 hereof) shall be deemed to acknowledge, that no Wells Firm represents it in connection with any such matters.
Section 8.16. Borrower not a Beneficiary or Party. Except with respect to the limitation of liability applicable to the Banks under
Section 8.11 and the Borrower’s right to approve additional Banks in accordance with Section 8.12, the provisions and agreements in this Article VIII are solely among the Banks and the Agent and the Borrower shall
not be considered a party thereto or a beneficiary thereof.
Section 8.17 Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent. Neither
the Syndication Agent nor the Documentation Agent shall have any duties, responsibilities, liabilities or obligations under this Agreement in their capacities as, respectively, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent.
ARTICLE IX
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or
remedy under the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy under
the Loan Documents. The remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
Section 9.2. Amendments, Requested Waivers, Etc. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom shall be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Banks and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the Agent; provided that no amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent shall do any of the following
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all Banks:
(a) increase the Commitments (except as permitted in accordance with
Section 2.13(b));
(b) reduce the amount of any principal of or interest due on the Loans or any Letter of Credit Obligation or
any fees payable to the Banks hereunder;
(c) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any outstanding Loan,
Letter of Credit Obligations or fees payable to the Banks hereunder;
(d) release any Guaranty or the pledge of any equity interest in any
Subsidiary under any Pledge Agreement, other than a release of such Guaranty or pledge of such equity interest to permit divestiture of the relevant Subsidiary permitted by this Agreement or specifically approved by the Required Banks;

(e) change the definition of “Required Banks”; or
(f) amend this Section 9.2 or any other provision of this Agreement requiring the consent or other action of the Required Banks or all Banks.


48








Any waiver or consent given hereunder shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Section 9.3. Notices and Distributions.
(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices, requests, demands and other communications provided for under the Loan Documents shall be in writing and mailed or delivered to the applicable parties at their respective addresses set forth on Schedule 9.3, or, as to each party, at
such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section 9.3. All such notices, requests, demands and other communications, when delivered,
shall be effective upon actual delivery and when mailed, shall be effective when sent by nationally recognized overnight mail courier or delivery service, addressed as aforesaid, except that notices or requests to the Agent or any Bank pursuant to
any of the provisions of Article II shall not be effective until received by the Agent or such Bank.
(b) The Borrower agrees that the Agent may make any material delivered by the Borrower to the Agent, as well as any amendments, waivers, consents, and other written information, documents, instruments and other
materials relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other materials or matters relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (collectively, the
“Communications”) available to the Banks by posting such notices on an electronic delivery system (which may be provided by the Agent, an Affiliate, or any Person that is not an Affiliate of the Agent), such as IntraLinks®, or a substantially similar electronic system that requires passwords for access and takes other customary measures with respect to confidentiality and security (the
“Platform”). The Borrower acknowledges that (i) the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution,
(ii) the Platform is provided “as is” and “as available” and (iii) neither the Agent nor any of its Affiliates represents or warrants the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, sufficiency or sequencing of the
Communications posted on the Platform. The Agent and its Affiliates expressly disclaim with respect to the Platform any liability for errors in transmission, incorrect or incomplete downloading, delays in posting or delivery, or problems accessing
the Communications posted on the Platform and any liability for any losses, costs, expenses or liabilities that may be suffered or incurred in connection with the Platform, except to the extent any of the foregoing liabilities are caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any of its Affiliates. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including, without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement
of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by the Agent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Platform.
(c) Each Bank agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) (a “Notification”) specifying that any Communication has been posted to the Platform shall for purposes of this Agreement constitute effective
delivery to such Bank of such information, documents or other materials comprising such Communication. Each Bank agrees (i) to notify, on or before the date such Bank becomes a party to this Agreement, the Agent in writing of such Bank’s
e-mail address to which a Notification may be sent (and from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Bank) and (ii) that any Notification may be sent to such e-mail address.



49








Section 9.4. Costs and Expenses. The Borrower will reimburse the Agent for (a) any and
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, lien and UCC searches, title and recording expenses and other similar expenses, paid or incurred by the Agent in connection
with the preparation, filing or recording of the Loan Documents and any other document or agreement related hereto or thereto, and the transactions contemplated hereby (which amount shall be paid on the date of this Agreement or as soon thereafter
as demand is made therefor) and the negotiation of any amendments, modifications or extensions to or of any of the foregoing documents, instruments or agreements and the preparation of any and all documents necessary or desirable to effect such
amendments, modifications or extensions, (b) customary transaction fees of the Agent incurred in connection with the loans contemplated hereby, (c) reasonable fees in connection with any audits or inspections by the Agent of any collateral
(if and to the extent collateral security is granted with respect to the Obligations) or the operations or business of the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries, whether conducted at the premises of the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries or at the
Agent’s premises, and (d) any and all other reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower will reimburse the Agent and each Bank for any and
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent and up to one counsel for all Banks other than the Agent in connection with the enforcement of any of the rights or remedies of the Agent or the Banks under any of the Loan Documents or under
applicable law, whether or not suit is filed with respect thereto.
Section 9.5. Indemnity. In addition to the payment of
expenses pursuant to Section 9.4, the Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Agent, each Bank and each of their respective participants, parent corporations, subsidiary corporations, affiliated corporations, successor
corporations, and all present and future officers, directors, employees and agents (the “Indemnitees”), from and against (i) any claim, loss or damage to which any Indemnitee may be subjected as a result of any past, present or future
existence, use, handling, storage, transportation or disposal of any Hazardous Substance by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any property owned, leased or controlled by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any
and all transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any governmental authority (excluding income or gross receipts taxes) by reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or the making of
any Loans and (iii) any and all liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceedings, whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto, which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or
arising out of or in connection with, the making of any Loans, issuance of any Letter of Credit or entering into this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans, excepting, however, from the
foregoing any such liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses resulting solely from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any Indemnitee or its related parties. If any investigative, judicial or
administrative proceeding arising from any of the foregoing is brought against any Indemnitee, upon request of such Indemnitee, the Borrower, or counsel designated by the Borrower and satisfactory to the Indemnitee, will resist and defend such
action, suit or proceeding to the extent and in the manner directed by the Indemnitee, at the Borrower’s sole cost and expense. Each Indemnitee will use its best efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding. If the
foregoing undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless may be held to be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, the Borrower shall nevertheless make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the
indemnified liabilities contemplated hereby which is permissible under applicable law. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.5 shall survive termination of this Agreement and the discharge of the Obligations.



50








Section 9.6. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement and other Loan Documents may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
Section 9.7. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
(a) Governing Law. The Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota, except to the extent the law of any other jurisdiction applies as to the

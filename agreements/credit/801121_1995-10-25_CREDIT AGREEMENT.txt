sold and transferred to each Bank without recourse or warranty, and
each Bank shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally
purchased and received from the Agent, an undivided interest and
participation to the extent of such Bank's Pro Rata share in such
Swing-Line Advance.

(ii) In the event the respective Borrower does not
repay a Swing-Line Advance when due the Agent will promptly notify the
Banks thereof and each Bank shall immediately pay to the Agent, in
lawful money of the United States and in same


E-22
<PAGE>   23

day funds, an amount equal to such Bank's Pro Rata share of such unpaid
Swing-Line Advance with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for each day
commencing on the day after such notification until such amount is paid
to the Agent.

(iii) Promptly after the Agent receives a repayment of
a Swing-Line Advance the Agent shall promptly pay to each Bank which
funded its participation therein, in lawful money of the United States
and in the kind of funds so received, an amount equal to such Bank's
ratable share of such payment, including its ratable share of interest
paid by the respective Borrower after the date such Bank funded its
participation therein.

(iv) The obligation of each Bank to make payments
under this subsection shall be unconditional and irrevocable and such
payments shall be made under all circumstances.

SECTION 2.03.  Making the Advances.  (a)  Each Borrowing shall
be made on notice:

(x)  on the fourth Business Day before the requested
date of a proposed Borrowing in Dollars, and

(y)  on the fifth Business Day before the requested
date of a proposed Borrowing in an Alternative Currency,

by the respective Borrower to the Agent, which shall then give each Bank prompt
written notice thereof by telecopier (a "Notice of Borrowing"). Each Notice of
Borrowing shall be by telecopier, confirmed immediately in writing, in
substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, specifying therein (i)
whether the requested Borrowing is an A Borrowing or a B Borrowing, (ii) the
principal amount of the Borrowing, (iii) the Currency of the Borrowing, (iv) the
date of the Borrowing, and (v) the requested initial Interest Period for each
Advance.

Each Bank shall, before 10:00 A.M. (San Francisco time) on the
date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending
Office to the Agent, in same day funds, (i) in the case of a Borrowing in
Dollars, at such account maintained at the Payment Office for Dollars as shall
have been notified by the Agent to the Banks prior thereto, such Bank's ratable
portion of such Borrowing in Dollars, and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing in an
Alternative Currency (provided that after giving effect to such Borrowing, the
equivalent in Dollars of Total A Liability or Total B Liability, as the case may
be, does not exceed the aggregate A Commitment or the aggregate B Commitment,
respectively, with such equivalent to be determined on the date of the Notice of
Borrowing), at such account maintained at the Payment Office for Alternative
Currency as shall have been notified by the Agent to the Banks


E-23
<PAGE>   24

prior thereto, such Bank's ratable portion of such Borrowing in such Alternative
Currency. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article V hereof, the Agent will make such
funds available to the respective Borrower at the aforesaid applicable Payment
Office.

(b) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding
on the respective Borrower. The respective Borrower shall indemnify each Bank
against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a result of any
failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing
for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article V, including,
without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or
expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by any Bank to fund the Eurocurrency Rate Advance to be
made by such Bank as part of such Borrowing when such Eurocurrency Rate Advance,
as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

(c) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank
prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the
Agent such Bank's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that
such Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such
Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.03 and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the respective Borrower
on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall
not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Bank and such
Borrower severally agree to repay the Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of the respective Borrower, the interest
rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in
the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such
Bank's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

(d) The failure of any Bank to make an Advance to be made by it
as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Bank
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Advance to be
made by such other Bank on the date of any Borrowing.

(e) Each Swing-Line Advance shall be made by an irrevocable
notice (a "Notice of Swing-Line Borrowing") in the form of Exhibit B-2,
given not later than 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the [first] Business Day
before the requested date of such Swing-Line Advance, which Notice may be made
by telephone (and confirmed immediately in writing) and shall specify (i)
whether the requested Swing-Line Advance is an A Swing-Line Advance or a B
Swing-Line Advance, (ii) the principal amount of the Swing-Line Advance,


E-24
<PAGE>   25


and (iii) the date of the Swing-Line Advance. The Agent will promptly notify
each Bank after it makes each Swing-Line Advance. Upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article V hereof, the Agent will make such
Swing-Line Advance available to the respective Borrower at the Payment Office
for Dollars.

SECTION 2.04. Fees.    (a) Commitment Fee. The
Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent for the account of each Bank a commitment
fee in Dollars on the average daily unused portion of such Bank's B Commitment
(less on any day the sum in Dollars of (x) A Advance Liability plus (y)
A Swing-Line Liability plus (z) B Swing-Line Liability) from the Closing
Date until the Revolver Termination Date at the rate of 3/10 of 1% per annum,
payable on the last day of each March, June, September and December during the
term hereof, commencing September 30, 1995, and on the Revolver Termination
Date. For purposes of determining the commitment fee hereunder, the equivalent
in Dollars of each Eurocurrency Rate Advance made by such Bank in an Alternative
Currency as determined on the date of the making of such Advance shall be the
amount of such Bank's B Commitment used in connection with such Advance, and no
further adjustments shall be made with respect to the unused portions of such
Bank's B Commitment based upon fluctuations thereafter in the value of the
Alternative Currency of such Advance.

(b) Participation Fee. The Borrowers agree to pay to
the Agent for the account of the Banks, a participation fee in Dollars in an
aggregate amount of 0.20% of the aggregate B Commitment. Such fee shall be
payable on the Closing Date.

(c) Agent Fees.  The Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent
such other fees in Dollars as are specified in a letter agreement dated June 27,
1995 between the Borrowers and the Agent.

SECTION 2.05.  Reduction of the Commitments. The A
Borrower shall have the right, upon at least five Business Days' notice to the
Agent, to terminate in whole or permanently reduce ratably in part the unused
portion of the A Commitment of each Bank; provided, however,
that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $2,000,000 or an
integral multiple thereof in excess of $1,000,000. Each B Borrower shall have
the right, upon at least five Business Days' notice to the Agent, to reduce
ratably in part the unused portion of the B Commitment to such B Borrower of
each Bank; provided; however, that each partial reduction shall
be in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof in
excess of $1,000,000.

Borrower agrees to repay the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to
such Borrower by each Bank on the Revolver Termination Date. Such payment shall
be made to the applicable Payment Office for the benefit of each such Bank.

(b) Swing-Line Advances. Each Borrower agrees to repay
the unpaid principal amount of each Swing-Line Advance made to such Borrower on
the seventh day after the making of such Swing-Line Advance. Such payment shall

deposit of such funds to the Agent's account maintained at the Payment Office
for Dollars.

SECTION 2.07. Interest. (a) A Advances. The A
Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each A Advance
made by each Bank from the date of such A Advance until such principal amount
shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum equal at all times during each
Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the Eurocurrency Rate for such
Interest Period plus 3% per annum payable on the last day of such
Interest Period, and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months,
payable also on the last day of each quarter during such Interest Period. All
interest payments under this Section 2.07(a) are to be made to the applicable
Payment Office for the benefit of each Bank.

(b) B Advances. Each B Borrower shall pay interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each B Advance made by each Bank from the date of
such B Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at a rate per
annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum
of the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus 1.15% per annum
payable on the last day of such Interest Period, and, if such Interest Period is
longer than three months, payable also on the last day of each quarter during
such Interest Period. All interest payments under this Section 2.07(b) are to be
made to the applicable Payment Office for the benefit of each Bank.

(c) A Swing-Line Advances. The A Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each A Swing- Line Advance made by
the Agent from the date of such A Swing-Line Advance until such principal amount
shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum equal to the Reference Rate
plus 1% per annum, and such interest shall be due and payable on the
date of payment of each such Swing-Line Advance. All interest payments under
this Section 2.07(c) are to be made to the Payment Office for Dollars and,
promptly after receipt thereof, to the extent any Bank has purchased a
participation in such Swing-Line Advance as provided in Section 2.02(c) hereof,
the Agent shall distribute to such Bank its Pro Rata share of such interest
payment.

(d) B Swing-Line Advances. Each B Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each B Swing- Line Advance made by
the Agent from the date of such B Swing-Line Advance until such principal amount

Advance. All interest payments under this Section 2.07(d) are to be made to the
Payment Office for Dollars, and, promptly after receipt thereof, to the


E-26
<PAGE>   27


extent any Bank has purchased a participation in such Swing-Line Advance as
provided in Section 2.02(c) hereof, the Agent shall distribute to such Bank its
Pro Rata share of such interest payment.

(e) Default Interest. Each Borrower shall pay interest
on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance or Swing- Line Advance that is
not paid when due and on the unpaid amount of all interest, fees and other
amounts payable hereunder that is not paid when due, payable on demand, at a
rate per annum equal at all times to (i) in the case of any amount of principal,
the greater of (x) 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on
such Advance or Swing-Line Advance immediately prior to the date on which such
amount became due and (y) 2% per annum above the Reference Rate in effect from
time to time and (ii) in the case of all other amounts, 2% per annum above the
Reference Rate in effect from time to time

SECTION 2.08. Additional Interest on Eurocurrency Rate
Advances. Each Borrower agrees to pay to each Bank so long as such Bank
shall be required under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets
consisting of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Advance of such Bank from the
date of such Eurocurrency Rate Advance until such principal amount is paid in
full, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained
by subtracting (i) the Eurocurrency Rate for the applicable Interest Period for
such Eurocurrency Rate Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such
Eurocurrency Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurocurrency Rate
Reserve Percentage of such Bank for such Interest Period, payable on each date
on which interest is payable on such Eurocurrency Rate Advance. Such additional
interest shall be determined by such Bank and notified to each Borrower through
the Agent.

SECTION 2.09. Interest Rate Determination and
Protection. (a) The Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Agent timely
information for the purpose of determining each Eurocurrency Rate. If the
Reference Bank shall not furnish such timely information to the Agent for the
purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Agent shall determine such
interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by any other major
international bank reasonably selected by it or as otherwise instructed by the
Majority Banks.

(b) The Agent shall give prompt notice to the respective
Borrower and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent
for purposes of Section 2.07(a), (b), (c) or (d).

(c) If, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the
Majority Banks notify the Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate for any Interest
Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority
Banks of making, funding or maintaining their


E-27
<PAGE>   28


respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall
forthwith so notify the respective Borrower and the Banks, whereupon

(i)     each Eurocurrency Rate Advance will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest
Period therefor, convert into a Reference Rate Advance, and

(ii)    the obligation of the Banks to make
Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall
notify the respective Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist.

(d) If any Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any
Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Agent will forthwith so notify such Borrower and the Banks and such Advances
will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, convert into Reference Rate Advances.

SECTION 2.10.  Prepayment.

(a) Voluntary Prepayments.

(i) Advances. Any Borrower may, upon at least
five Business Days' notice to the Agent stating the proposed date and
aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is
given such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole
or ratably in part together with accrued interest thereon to the date
of prepayment on the amount prepaid, provided, however,
that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal
amount not less than $1,000,000 (determined on the date notice of
prepayment is given in accordance with Section 2.17) and (y) any
prepayment of any Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be made on, and only
on, the last day of an Interest Period for such Advances.

(ii) Swing-Line Advances. Any Borrower may,
upon at least one Business Days' notice to the Agent stating the
proposed date of prepayment, prepay in full any Swing-Line Advance
together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment.


E-28
<PAGE>   29


(b) Mandatory Prepayments. (i) A Advances. If,
on the last day of any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Rate Advances
comprising the same Borrowing, the equivalent in Dollars of the Total A
Liability exceeds the aggregate A Commitment, the A Borrower agrees to
prepay on such last day such excess to the Agent, with accrued interest
to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid.
Mandatory prepayments pursuant to this subsection (b)(i) shall be
applied to the ratable payment of all outstanding A Advances.

(ii)  B Advances.  If, on the last day of any Interest
Period for Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising the same Borrowing,
the equivalent in Dollars of the Total B Liability exceeds the
aggregate B Commitment or the sum of Total A Liability plus Total B
Liability exceeds the Total Commitment, the B Borrowers agree to prepay
on such last day to the Agent such excess, with accrued interest to the
date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. Mandatory
prepayments pursuant to this subsection (b)(ii) shall be applied to the
ratable payment of all outstanding B Advances.

SECTION 2.11. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either
(i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of
imposition or increase of reserve requirements in the case of Eurocurrency Rate
Advances included in the Eurocurrency Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Advances,
then each Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Bank (with a
copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost. A
certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to each Borrower
and the Agent by such Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

(b) If any Bank determines that compliance with any law or
regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would
affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank
or any corporation controlling such Bank and that the amount of such capital is
increased by or based upon the existence of such Bank's commitment to lend
hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Bank
(with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrowers shall immediately pay
to the Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by
such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank or such
corporation in light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank
reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence
of such Bank's commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts


E-29
<PAGE>   30


submitted to each Borrower and the Agent by such Bank shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

SECTION 2.12. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if any Bank shall notify the Agent that the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Eurocurrency Lending
Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurocurrency Rate Advances
or to fund or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder in any jurisdiction,
(i) the obligation of the Banks to make Advances at the Eurocurrency Rate (or
some variation thereof) in such jurisdiction shall be suspended until the Agent
shall notify each Borrower and the Banks that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist and (ii) each Borrower shall forthwith prepay in full
all Advances made at the Eurocurrency Rate (or some variation thereof) of all
Banks with respect to such jurisdiction then outstanding, together with interest
accrued thereon, unless each Borrower, within five Business Days of notice from
the Agent, converts all Advances made at the Eurocurrency Rate (or same
variation thereof) of all Banks with respect to such jurisdiction then
outstanding into Advances made at the Reference Rate (or some variation thereof)
on the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Advances.

SECTION 2.13. Payments and Computations. (a) Each
Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, except with
respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Advances
denominated in an Alternative Currency, not later than 10:00 A.M. (San Francisco
time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent in same day funds by deposit
of such funds to the Agent's account maintained at the Payment Office for
Dollars in San Francisco. Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder and
under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts
relating to Advances denominated in an Alternative Currency not later than 10:00
A.M. (at the Payment Office for such Alternative Currency) on the day when due
in such Alternative Currency to the Agent in same day funds by deposit of the
funds to the Agent's account maintained at such Payment Office. The Agent will
promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment
of principal or interest or commitment fees ratably (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.08, 2.11 or 2.15) to each Bank for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office, and like funds relating to the payment of any other
amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the account of its Applicable
Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

(b) Each Borrower hereby authorizes each Bank, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Bank is not made when due hereunder or under the
Note held by such Bank, to charge from time to time against any or all of such
Borrower's accounts with such Bank any amount so due.


E-30
<PAGE>   31



(c) All computations of interest and of fees shall be made on
the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for
which such interest or fee is payable.

(d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case
may be.

(e) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that such
Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the
extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent,
each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed
to such Bank together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate, for each
day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank.

SECTION 2.14. Extension of Revolver Termination Date.
Not earlier than 60 days or more than 90 days before the Revolver Termination
Date then in effect, all the Borrowers may request a 364 day extension of such
Revolver Termination Date. Such request must be submitted in writing to each of
the Banks, the Issuing Bank and the Agent. Not later than 30 days after receipt
of such notice, each Bank shall notify the Agent whether (in its sole and
absolute discretion) it consents to such request (and if any Bank fails to so
notify the Agent, it shall be deemed not to have consented to such request) and
the Agent promptly thereafter shall notify the Borrowers and the Banks of the
results thereof. If the Agent fails to so notify the Borrowers, the Banks shall
be deemed not to have consented to such request. If all of the Banks have
consented, then, so long as the representations and warranties contained in
Article VI hereof (other than (i) representations and warranties
which expressly speak as of a particular date or are no longer true and correct
as a result of a change which is permitted by this Agreement or (ii) as
otherwise disclosed by any Borrower and approved in writing by the Majority
Banks) shall be true and correct on and as of the Revolver Termination Date then
in effect and no Default or Event of Default shall exist, the Revolver
Termination Date shall be extended, effective as of the Revolver Termination
Date then in effect, to the date that is 364 days from such Revolver Termination
Date.

SECTION 2.15. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by a
Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section
2.13, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or


E-31
<PAGE>   32

withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case
of each Bank and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank or the
Agent, as the case may be, is organized or any political subdivision thereof
and, in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes
imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Bank's Applicable Lending Office or
any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to
as "Taxes"). If such Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from
or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Bank or the
Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.15) such Bank or the Agent, as the case may
be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii)
such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

(b) In addition, the Borrowers agree to pay any present or
future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under the Notes
or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect
to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

(c) The Borrowers agree to indemnify each Bank and the Agent
for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.15) paid by such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, and any
liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the
date such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand therefor.

(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, each
Borrower agrees to furnish to the Agent, at its address specified in Section
11.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.
If no Taxes are payable in respect of any payment hereunder or under the Notes,
such Borrower will furnish to the Agent, at such address, a certificate from
each appropriate taxing authority, or an opinion of counsel acceptable to the
Agent, in either case stating that such payment is exempt from or not subject to
Taxes.

(e) Each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by
the A Borrower (but only so long as such Bank


E-32
<PAGE>   33


remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the A Borrower with Internal
Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, as appropriate, or any successor form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Bank is
entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a
party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or
certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively
connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If the
form provided by a Bank at the time such Bank first becomes a party to this
Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of
zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from "Taxes" as
defined in subsection (a) of this Section 2.15.

(f) For any period with respect to which a Bank has failed to
provide the A Borrower with the appropriate form described in subsection (e) of
this Section 2.15 (other than if such failure is due to a change
in law occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required
to be provided, or if such form otherwise is not required under the first
sentence of subsection (e) above), such Bank shall not be entitled to
indemnification under subsection (c) of this Section 2.15 with respect to Taxes
imposed by the United States; provided, however, that should a
Bank become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
hereunder, the A Borrower shall take such steps as such Bank shall reasonably
request to assist such Bank to recover such Taxes.

(g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
any Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of each Borrower
contained in this Section 2.15 shall survive the payment in full of principal
and interest hereunder and under the Notes.

(h) In the event that a Borrower becomes obligated to make any
payment pursuant to subsection (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 2.15, such
Borrower may request, by written notice, that the respective Bank with respect
to which the payment was made file a claim for refund of the Taxes or Other
Taxes (as well as any penalties or interest for which a payment was made). Such
written notice shall specify the payments made by such Borrower for which such
Borrower requests that such Bank file a claim for refund and shall contain an
opinion of counsel that such Bank has a reasonable basis for claiming such
refund. Any such Bank that receives such a written notice from a Borrower shall
within 30 days file a claim for refund for the requested amounts and shall take
all reasonable steps to pursue such refund. The requested Bank shall have the
right to control any such refund proceeding as well as any resulting
administrative or judicial proceeding. The requesting Borrower shall indemnify
the requested Bank for all out-of-pocket expenses (including, but not limited
to, attorneys' and accounting fees) incurred by such Bank in connection with
such claim for refund. If such Bank receives a refund, such Bank shall promptly
remit the refund to such Borrower.

SECTION 2.16. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank
shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise
of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances made by it
(other than pursuant to Section 2.08, 2.11 or 2.15) in excess of its ratable
share of payments on account of the Advances, obtained by all the Banks, such
Bank shall forthwith purchase from the other Banks such participations in the
Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to
share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each Bank shall be
rescinded and such Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price to
the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Bank's ratable
share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Bank's required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of
the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing
a participation from another Bank pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Bank were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

SECTION 2.17. Currency Equivalents. For purposes of the
provisions of this Article II, (i) the equivalent in Dollars of any Alternative
Currency shall be determined by using the quoted spot rate at which the Agent's

Currency in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the date on which such
equivalent is to be determined, (ii) the equivalent in any Alternative Currency
of any other Alternative Currency shall be determined by using the quoted spot
rate at which the Agent's principal office in London offers to exchange such
Alternative Currency for the equivalent in Dollars of such other Alternative
Currency in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the date on which such
equivalent is to be determined, and (iii) the equivalent in any Alternative
Currency of Dollars shall be determined by using the quoted spot rate at which
the Agent's principal office in London offers to exchange such Alternative
Currency for Dollars in London at 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the date on which
such equivalent is to be determined.

SECTION 2.18. Evidence of Debt. The Debt of each
Borrower resulting from the Advances (other than Swing-Line Advances) shall be
evidenced by the Notes delivered to the Banks pursuant to Article V, and the
remaining principal amount thereof shall be recorded by the Banks, and, prior to
any transfer, endorsed on the grids thereto in accordance with the terms of the
Notes. The Agent shall also maintain, in accordance with its usual practices, an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower under this
Agreement and the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to each
Bank from time to time under this Agreement which accounts, among other things,
will provide the record for all borrowings

and payments of Swing-Line Advances and shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

any such Letter of Credit.

(b) The obligations of each Borrower hereunder with respect to
such Letters of Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms hereof under all circumstances, including
without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
such Letter of Credit or Loan Document or any agreement or
instrument relating thereto;

(ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or
other right which any Borrower may have at any time against
the beneficiary, or any transferee, of any such Letter of
Credit, or the Issuing Bank, any Bank, or any other Person;

(iii) any draft, certificate, or other document
presented under any such Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect;

(iv) any lack of validity, effectiveness, or
sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or
the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part;

(v) any loss or delay in the transmission or
otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing

shall either (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by the Issuing Bank or
(ii) impose on the Issuing Bank or any Bank any other condition regarding
letters of credit or, in the case of such Bank, its participation hereunder in
Letters of Credit, and the result of any event referred to in the preceding
clause (i) or (ii) shall be to increase the cost to the Issuing Bank of Issuing
or maintaining or, in the case of such Bank, having a participation in Letters
of Credit, then, upon demand by the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may
be, (with a copy to the Agent) the Borrowers shall immediately pay to such
Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, from time to time as specified by
such Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, (with a copy to Agent)
additional amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuing Bank or
such Bank, as the case may be, for such increased cost. Each certificate as to

Bank as a result of any event mentioned in clause (i) or (ii) above, submitted

binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(b) Capital. If the Issuing Bank or any Bank determines that
compliance with any law or regulation or with any guideline or request from any
central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of
law) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital
of the Issuing Bank or such Bank or any corporation controlling the Issuing Bank
or such Bank as a consequence of, or with reference to, the Issuing Bank's
commitment to Issue, issuance of, or, with respect to such Bank's commitment, to
participate in, any Letter of Credit hereunder below the rate that the Issuing
Bank or such Bank or such other corporation could have achieved but for
compliance therewith (taking into account the policies of the Issuing Bank, such
Bank or such corporation with regard to capital), then the Borrowers shall from
time to time, upon demand by the Issuing Bank or such Bank (with a copy of such
demand to the Agent), immediately pay to the


E-41
<PAGE>   42

Issuing Bank or such Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate the
Issuing Bank or such Bank or other corporation for such reduction. A certificate
as to such amounts, submitted to each Borrower and the Agent by the Issuing Bank
or such Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error. The Issuing Bank and each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers
and the Agent of any circumstances that would cause the Borrowers to pay
additional amounts pursuant to this subsection (b), provided, that, the failure
to give such notice shall not affect any Borrower's obligation to pay such
additional amounts hereunder.

(c) Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to the survival
of any other obligation of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and
obligations of each Borrower contained in this Section 3.07 shall survive the
payment in full of the Advances (after the Revolver Termination Date).

SECTION 3.08. Uniform Customs and Practice. The Uniform
Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits as most recently published by the
International Chamber of Commerce shall in all respects be deemed a part of this
Article III as if incorporated herein and shall apply to the Letters of Credit.

THE GUARANTEE

SECTION 4.01. The Guarantee. The A Borrower (in its capacity
as guarantor being the "Guarantor") hereby unconditionally jointly and severally
guarantees (the "Guarantee") to each of the Banks, the Issuing Bank and the
Agent the payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by reason of
acceleration or otherwise) of all obligations (the "Obligations") of the B
Borrowers under this Agreement and the Notes of the B Borrowers, or any document
delivered in connection therewith, including without limitation reimbursement
obligations for payments under Letters of Credit issued for the account of any B
Borrower.

SECTION 4.02. Guaranty Absolute. The Guarantor guarantees that
the Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with their terms, regardless
of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction
affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Bank, the Issuing Bank and/or
the Agent with respect thereto. The obligations of the Guarantor under this
Guarantee are independent of the Obligations, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce the Guarantee
irrespective of whether any action is brought against any B Borrower or whether


E-42
<PAGE>   43

any B Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. The liability of the
Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective
of:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
or any Note;

(ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other
amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement,
including any increase in the Obligations resulting from the extension
of additional credit;

(iii) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any
collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent
to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the
Obligations;

(iv) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds
thereof, to all or any of the Obligations, or any manner of sale or
other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Obligations
or any other assets of any B Borrower;

(v) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
structure or existence of any B Borrower; or

(vi) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
defense available to, or a discharge of, any B Borrower, or any other
guarantor.

This Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by any Bank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any B Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had
not been made.

SECTION 4.03. Waivers. The Guarantor hereby waives (and
consents in advance to the taking, or the failure to take, any action specified
below), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:

(i) any requirement that any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the
Agent secure or insure any security interest or lien or any property
subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any B
Borrower or any other person (including any other guarantor) or any
collateral;

(ii) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense
based upon an election of remedies by any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the
Agent (including, without limitation, an election to non-judicially
foreclose on any real or personal property


E-43
<PAGE>   44

collateral) which in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise
adversely affects its subrogation, reimbursement or contribution rights
or other rights to proceed against any B Borrower, any other guarantor
or any other Person or any collateral;

(iii) any defense arising by reason of the failure of any
other Person to execute this Agreement or any other agreement or
guaranty;

(iv) any defense or benefits that may be derived from
California Civil Code Sections 2808, 2809, 2810, 2815, 2819, 2845 or
2850 or California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580d
(including, without limitation, any defense based on estoppel arising
out of the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil
Procedure in the context of nonjudicial foreclosure or any comparable
provision of the law of any other jurisdiction) or 726, or comparable
provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction and all other
suretyship and other similar defenses it would otherwise have under the
laws of California or any other jurisdiction;

(v) all rights and defenses arising out of an election of
remedies by any Bank, even though that election of remedies, such as a
nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed
obligation, has destroyed the Guarantor's rights of subrogation and
reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of
the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.

(vi) any duty on the part of any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the
Agent to disclose to the Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating
to the business, operation or condition of any B Borrower and its
assets now known or hereafter known by such Bank, the Issuing Bank or
the Agent;

Guarantor's liability under this Guarantee or affecting the enforcement
of this Guarantee or any of the Obligations or realization on any
collateral for the Obligations;

(viii)   all setoffs and counterclaims;

(ix) promptness, diligence, presentment, demand for
performance and protest;

(x) notice of non-performance, default, acceleration, protest
or dishonor;

(xi) except for any notice otherwise required by applicable
laws that may not be effectively waived by the Guarantor (all of which
are hereby waived to the fullest


E-44
<PAGE>   45

extent permitted by law), notice of sale or other disposition of any
collateral for the Obligations; and

(xii) notice of acceptance of this Guarantee and of the
existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Obligations.

SECTION 4.04. Waiver of Subrogation. Until the Obligations are
paid in full, Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claim or other rights
(including, without limitation, any rights arising under California Civil Code
Sections 2847, 2848 or 2849) that it may now or hereafter acquire against any B
Borrower that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of
the Guarantor's obligations under this Guarantee, including, without limitation,
any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification by or from any B Borrower and any right to participate in any
claim or remedy of any Bank against any B Borrower or any collateral for the
Obligations, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or
under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right
to take or receive from any B Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other
property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of
such claim, remedy or right. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in
violation of the preceding sentence at any time prior to the later of (x) the
payment in full in cash of the Obligations and all other amounts payable under
this Guarantee and (y) the expiration or termination of any commitment of any
Bank to extend credit under any this Agreement, such amount shall be held in
trust for the benefit of the Agent and the Banks and shall forthwith be paid to
the Agent to be credited and applied to the Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guarantee, whether matured or unmatured, or to be held as
collateral for any Obligations or other amounts payable under this Guarantee
thereafter arising. The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and
indirect benefits from the transactions provided for in this Agreement, and that
the waiver set forth in this Section 4.04 is knowingly made in contemplation of
such benefits.

SECTION 4.05 Financial Condition of B Borrowers. The Guarantor
represents to each Bank, the Issuing Bank and the Agent that the Guarantor is
now and will be completely familiar with the business, operations and conditions
of the B Borrowers, and the Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any duty on
the part of any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent to disclose any matter, fact
or thing relating to the business, operations or conditions of the B Borrowers
now known or hereafter known by such Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent.

ARTICLE IX

THE AGENT

SECTION 9.01. Authorization and Action. Each Bank and the
Issuing Bank hereby appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are
delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of the
Notes), the Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
Majority Banks, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Banks, the
Issuing Bank and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall
not be required to take any action which exposes the Agent to personal liability
or which is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Agent agrees to
give to each Bank and the Issuing Bank prompt notice of each notice given to it
by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.02. Agent's Reliance, Etc. Neither the Agent nor any
of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this
Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Agent: (i) may treat
the payee of any Note as the holder thereof and treat the Banks that purchased
or funded a participation with respect to a Letter of Credit as the holder or
owner of Debt resulting therefrom until the Agent receives written notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and including the agreement
of the assignee or transferee to be bound hereby as it would have been if it had
been an original Bank party hereto, in form satisfactory to the Agent; (ii) may
consult with legal counsel (including counsel for any Borrower), independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with
the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or
representation to any Bank and shall not be responsible to any Bank for any
statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made in or
in connection with any Loan Document; (iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain
or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants
or conditions of any Loan Document on the part of any Borrower or any Subsidiary
thereof or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of such
Borrower or Subsidiary thereof; (v) shall not be responsible to any Bank for the
due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of any Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability


E-62
<PAGE>   63

under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent,
certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telecopier) believed
by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

SECTION 9.03. ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and its Affiliates. With
respect to its Commitment, the Advances made by it, the Note issued to it and
the participations in Letters of Credit purchased by it, ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and
may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent; and the term "Bank" or
"Banks" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
in its individual capacity. ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and its Affiliates may accept
deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally
engage in any kind of business with, any Borrower, any Subsidiaries thereof and
any Person who may do business with or own securities of any such Borrower or
Subsidiary thereof, all as if ABN AMRO Bank N.V. were not the Agent and without
any duty to account therefor to the Banks.

SECTION 9.04. Bank Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges
that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Issuing Bank
or any other Bank and based on the financial statements referred to in Section
6.04 and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and any other
Loan Document. Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any other Bank and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and any other Loan Document.

SECTION 9.05. Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify
the Agent and the Issuing Bank (in each case, to the extent not reimbursed by
any Borrower), ratably according to the respective principal amounts of the
Advances then held by each of them (or, if no Advances are at the time
outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of their commitments
hereunder), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against the Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
Letter of Credit or any action taken or omitted by the Agent or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
Letter of Credit; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's or
the Issuing Bank's, as the case may be, gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank agrees to reimburse the Agent and
the Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any


E-63
<PAGE>   64

out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any Letter of Credit to the extent that the Agent or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, is not reimbursed for such expenses by any Borrower.

SECTION 9.06. Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any
time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and each Borrower and the
Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority Banks.
Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the right to
appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by
the Majority Banks, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days
after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority
Banks' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of
the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof, the laws
of the United Kingdom or the laws of France and having a combined capital and
surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Agent and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations under this Agreement and any other Loan Document. After any
retiring Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
Article IX shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan Document.

ARTICLE X

THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE B BORROWERS

SECTION 10.01. Liability of each B Borrower. Each B Borrower
agrees that such B Borrower is jointly and severally liable to each Bank, the
Issuing Bank and the Agent for all Obligations (as defined in Section 4.01).

SECTION 10.02. Absolute Liability. Each B Borrower agrees that
the Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with their terms, regardless
of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction
affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Bank, the Issuing Bank and/or
the Agent with respect thereto. The obligations of each B Borrower under this
Article X are independent of the Obligations, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted against such B Borrower to enforce this Article X
irrespective of whether any action is brought against any other B Borrower or


E-64
<PAGE>   65


whether any other B Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. The
liability of such B Borrower under this Article X shall be absolute and
unconditional irrespective of:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
or any Note;

(ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other
amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement,
including any increase in the Obligations resulting from the extension
of additional credit;

(iii) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any
collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of or consent
to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the
Obligations;

(iv) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds
thereof, to all or any of the Obligations, or any manner of sale or
other disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Obligations
or any other assets of any other B Borrower;

(v) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
structure or existence of any other B Borrower; or

(vi) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
defense available to, or a discharge of, any other B Borrower, or any
guarantor.

The provisions of this Article X shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Bank upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any other B Borrower or otherwise,
all as though such payment had not been made.

SECTION 10.03. Waiver. Each B Borrower hereby waives (and
consents in advance to the taking or failure to take, any action specified
below), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:

(i) any requirement that any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the
Agent secure or insure any security interest or lien or any property
subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any
other B Borrower or any other person (including any other guarantor) or
any collateral;

(ii) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense
based upon an election of remedies by any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the
Agent (including, without limitation, an election to non-judicially
foreclose on any real or personal property


E-65
<PAGE>   66

collateral) which in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise
adversely affects its subrogation, reimbursement or contribution rights
or other rights to proceed against any other B Borrower, any guarantor
or any other Person or any collateral;

(iii) any defense arising by reason of the failure of any
other Person to execute this Agreement or any other agreement or
guaranty;

(iv) any defense or benefits that may be derived from
California Civil Code Sections 2808, 2809, 2810, 2815, 2819, 2845 or
2850 or California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580d
(including, without limitation, any defense based on estoppel arising
out of the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil
Procedure in the context of nonjudicial foreclosure or any comparable
provision of the law of any other jurisdiction) or 726, or comparable
provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction and all other
suretyship and other similar defenses it would otherwise have under the
laws of California or any other jurisdiction;

(v) all rights and defenses arising out of an election of
remedies by any Bank, even though that election of remedies, such as a
nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed
obligation, has destroyed such B Borrower's rights of subrogation and
reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of
the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.

(vi) any duty on the part of any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the
Agent to disclose to such B Borrower any matter, fact or thing relating
to the business, operation or condition of any other B Borrower and its
assets now known or hereafter known by such Bank, the Issuing Bank or
the Agent;

(vii) all benefits of any statute of limitations affecting
such B Borrower's liability under this Article X or affecting the
enforcement of this Article X or any of the Obligations or realization
on any collateral for the Obligations;

(viii) all setoffs and counterclaims;

(ix) promptness, diligence, presentment, demand for
performance and protest;

(x) notice of non-performance, default, acceleration, protest
or dishonor;

(xi) except for any notice otherwise required by applicable
laws that may not be effectively waived by such B Borrower (all of
which are hereby waived to the fullest


E-66
<PAGE>   67

extent permitted by law), notice of sale or other disposition of any
collateral for the Obligations; and

(xii) notice of acceptance of this Article X and of the
existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Obligations.

SECTION 10.04. Waiver of Subrogation . Until the Obligations
are paid in full, each B Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any claim or other
rights (including, without limitation, any rights arising under California Civil
Code Sections 2847, 2848 or 2849) that it may now or hereafter acquire against
any other B Borrower that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of such B Borrower's obligations under this Article X, including,
without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution or indemnification by or from any other B Borrower and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of any Bank against any other B Borrower or
any collateral for the Obligations, whether or not such claim, remedy or right
arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without
limitation, the right to take or receive from any other B Borrower, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right. If any amount
shall be paid to such B Borrower in violation of the preceding sentence at any
time prior to the later of (x) the payment in full in cash of the Obligations
and all other amounts payable under this Article X and (y) the expiration or
termination of any commitment of the Bank to extend credit under any this
Agreement, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Bank and
shall forthwith be paid to the Bank to be credited and applied to the
Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Article X, whether matured
or unmatured, or to be held as collateral for any Obligations or other amounts
payable under this Article X thereafter arising. Each B Borrower acknowledges
that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the transactions provided
for in this Agreement, and that the waiver set forth in this Section 10.04 is
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

SECTION 10.05. Financial Condition of B Borrowers. Each B
Borrower represents to each Bank, the Issuing Bank and the Agent that such B
Borrower is now and will be completely familiar with the business, operations
and conditions of the other B Borrowers, and such B Borrower hereby waives and
relinquishes any duty on the part of any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent to
disclose any matter, fact or thing relating to the business, operations or
conditions of the other B Borrowers now known or hereafter known by such Bank,
the Issuing Bank or the Agent.

SECTION 10.06. Certain Limitations. Section 10.01 of this
Agreement notwithstanding:


E-67
<PAGE>   68

(a) the liability of INMAC GmbH under this Agreement for the
Obligations of any other B Borrower shall at all times be limited to
the amount by which INMAC GmbH's equity (the calculation of which shall
take into account the captions reflected in Section 266(3)A I through V
of the German Commercial Code) at that time exceeds INMAC GmbH's
registered share capital (the "Surplus Equity") and further provided
that in determining the Surplus Equity such liabilities shall not be
valued below their true value and such assets shall not be valued above
their true realizable value so that such liabilities under this
Agreement would at no time require the payment of any monies which are
needed to maintain a net asset value which is at least equal to INMAC
GmbH's registered share capital;

(b) the liability of INMAC SA under this Agreement shall at
all times be limited to the Maximum Financial Capacity of Inmac S.A. at
the time of such payment where "Maximum Financial Capacity" means, as
of the time of its determination, an amount equal to the excess of (i)
the Net Worth of Inmac S.A. over (ii) $1,000,000 and where "Net Worth"
means, with respect to Inmac S.A., its "capitaux propres" as determined
in accordance with French generally accepted accounting principles as
reflected in the annual financial statements for the most recently
ended fiscal year of Inmac S.A.; and

(c) the liability of INMAC AB under this Agreement for the
Obligations of any other B Borrower shall at all times (i) not include
any such Obligations to the extent the proceeds of the respective B
Borrowings are loaned directly or indirectly to the A Borrower and (ii)
be limited to the amount which corresponds to the unrestricted equity
of INMAC AB ("fritt eget kapital") calculated in accordance with
Chapter 12, Section 2 of the Swedish Companies Act.

SECTION 11.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of
any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising,
any right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

SECTION 11.04. Costs, Expenses and Taxes. (a) Each Borrower
agrees to pay the Agent and the Issuing Bank on demand all reasonable costs and
expenses of the Agent and the Issuing Bank, respectively, in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, approval, execution, delivery, filing, recording,
administration, modification and amendment of any of the Loan Documents and the
other documents to be delivered under such Loan Documents, including, without

date for such Advance as specified in accordance with Section 2.06, as a result
of a payment pursuant to Section 2.12, acceleration of the maturity of the Notes
pursuant to Section 8.01 or for any other reason, such respective Borrower
shall, upon demand by any Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to
the Agent for the account of such Bank any amounts required to compensate such
Bank for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur
as a result of such payment, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or

due and payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.01 or to demand payment
of all then outstanding Total Letter of Credit Liability, each Bank is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank to or for the credit
or the account of any Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such
Borrower now or hereafter existing under any Loan Document to such Bank
(including, to the fullest extent permitted by law, obligations indirectly owed
to such Bank by virtue of its purchase of a participation of the Total Letter of
Credit Liability pursuant to Section 3.04), whether or not such Bank shall have
made any demand under this Agreement or such Note and although such obligations
may be unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify such Borrower after any
such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
The rights of each Bank under this Section 11.05 are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such
Bank may have.

SECTION 11.06. Judgment. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining
a judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under
the Notes in Dollars or in an Alternative Currency (the "Original Currency")
into another currency (the "Other Currency"), the parties hereto agree, to the
fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used
shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent
could purchase the Original Currency with the Alternative Currency at the close
of business on the Business Day immediately preceding that on which the final
judgment is given.

(b) The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any sum due
in the Original Currency from it to any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent
hereunder or under the Note held by such Bank shall, notwithstanding any
judgment in any Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the
Business Day following receipt by such Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent, as
the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in such Other Currency such
Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, may in accordance with
normal banking procedures purchase Dollars or the appropriate Alternative
Currency, as the case may be, with such Other Currency; if the amount of the
Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Bank
or the Agent, as the case may be, in the Original Currency, each Borrower
agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to
indemnify such Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, against
such loss, and if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased exceeds the
sum originally due to any Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent, as the case may
be, in the Original Currency, such Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Agent,as the
case may be, agrees to remit to each Borrower such excess.

SECTION 11.07. Indemnification. Each Borrower agrees to
defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, each Bank and the
Issuing Bank and their respective Affiliates and the directors, officers,
employees, attorneys and agents of the Agent, each Bank, the Issuing Bank and
such Affiliates (each of the foregoing being an "Indemnitee" and all of the
foregoing being collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all
claims, actions, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, all fees and disbursements of counsel and environmental consultants
which may be incurred in the investigation or defense of any matter) imposed
upon, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third-party, whether
direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or
foreign laws or other statutes or regulations (including, without limitation,
securities and commercial laws and regulations), under common law or on
equitable cause, or on contract, tort or otherwise, including, without
limitation, those arising:

(a) by reason of, relating to or in connection with the
execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of any Loan Document,
any commitments relating thereto, or any transaction contemplated by
any Loan Document; or

(b) in connection with any investigation, litigation,
proceeding or other action relating to any Loan Document (whether or
not any Indemnitee is a party thereto); or

(c) by reason of, relating to or in connection with any credit
extended or used under the Loan Documents or any act done or omitted by
any Person, or any event occurring, in connection therewith, or the
exercise of any rights or remedies thereunder;

provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no Borrower shall be
liable to any Indemnitee for any portion of such claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses resulting from such Indemnitee's or such Indemnitee's Affiliate's,
director's, officer's, employee's, attorney's or agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. In the event this indemnity is unenforceable as a matter of
law as to a particular matter or consequence referred to herein, it shall be
enforceable to the full extent permitted by law.

This indemnification applies, without limitation, to any act,
omission, event or circumstance existing or occurring on or prior to the date of
payment in full of the Advances. The indemnification provisions set forth above
shall be in addition to any liability any Borrower may otherwise have. Without
prejudice to the survival of any other obligation of each Borrower hereunder,
the indemnities and obligations of each such Borrower contained in this Section
11.07 shall survive the payment in full of the Advances and the Swing-Line
Advances.

SECTION 11.08. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made in, and in any certificates and other
documents delivered pursuant to, this Agreement and any other Loan Document
shall be deemed to have been relied upon by each Bank and shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and any other Loan Document, regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Bank, in full force and effect
until payment in full of all liabilities on the part of the Borrowers arising
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

SECTION 11.09. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by each Borrower, the Agent and the
Issuing Bank and when the Agent shall have been notified by each Bank that such
Bank has executed it and thereafter it shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of each Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank and their
respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower shall have the right
to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written
consent of the Banks.

SECTION 11.10. Severability of Provisions. Each provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 11.11. Assignments and Participations. (a) Each Bank
may assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its rights

be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations
under this Agreement, including a constant percentage at its A Commitment and B
Commitment, (ii) the amount of the A Commitment and B Commitment of the

the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the


E-73

extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Bank
hereunder and (y) the Bank assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or
the remaining portion of an assigning Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Bank makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition

this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section 6.04 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Bank or any other Bank and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the
Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Bank.

(c) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
Section 11.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted
by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks
and the A Commitment and B Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances
owing to, each Bank from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error, and each Borrower, the Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower or any
Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and

new Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the A
Commitment and B Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance and, if the assigning Bank has retained an A Commitment and B
Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Bank in an amount
equal to the commitments retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall
be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such
Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of
Exhibit A hereto.

(e) Each Bank may sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its

other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) such Bank
shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of this Agreement, and

participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
11.11, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Bank by
or on behalf of the Borrowers; provided that, prior to any such disclosure, the
assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to
preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the
Borrowers received by it from such Bank.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Bank may at any time create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the

Reserve System.

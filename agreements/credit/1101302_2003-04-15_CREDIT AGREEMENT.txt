CREDIT FACILITIES

Section 2.1.   Commitment as to Revolving Facility. Each Bank
hereby agrees, on the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, to
make Revolving Advances to the Borrower from time to time during the period from
the date hereof to and including the Revolving Commitment Termination Date, in
an aggregate amount at any time outstanding not to exceed such Bank's Percentage
of each Borrowing from time to time requested by the Borrower under the
Revolving Facility; provided, however, that (a) the Revolving Facility
Outstanding Amount shall at no time exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount and
(b) no Bank's Percentage of the Revolving Facility Outstanding Amount shall at
any time exceed such Bank's Revolving Commitment. Within the above limits, the
Borrower may obtain Revolving Advances, prepay Revolving Advances in accordance
with the terms hereof and reborrow Revolving Advances in accordance with the
applicable terms and conditions of this Article II.

Section 2.2.   Procedures for Borrowing Under the Revolving
Facility. Each Borrowing under the Revolving Facility shall be funded by the
Banks as either Floating Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances, as the
Borrower shall specify in the related notice of proposed Borrowing. Floating
Rate Advances and Eurodollar Rate Advances may be outstanding at the same time.
It is understood, however, that (i) in the case of a Borrowing which is to bear
interest at a Floating Rate, the principal amount of the Borrowing shall be in
an amount equal to or greater than $500,000 or a higher integral multiple of
$100,000 and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing which is to bear interest at a
Eurodollar Rate, the principal amount of the Borrowing shall be in an amount
equal to $1,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $100,000. The Borrower
shall give notice to the Agent of each proposed Borrowing not later than 10:00
a.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on a Business Day which, in the case of a
Borrowing that is to bear interest initially at a Floating Rate, is the proposed
date of such Borrowing or, in the case of a Borrowing that is to bear interest
initially at a Eurodollar Rate, is at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
proposed date of such Borrowing. Each such notice shall be effective upon
receipt by the Agent, shall be in writing or by telephone or telecopy
transmission, to be confirmed in writing by the Borrower if so requested by the
Agent (in the form of Exhibit B), and shall specify whether the Borrowing is to
bear interest initially at a Floating Rate or a Eurodollar Rate, and in the case
of a Borrowing that is to bear interest initially at a Eurodollar Rate, shall
specify the Interest Period to be applicable thereto. Promptly upon receipt of
such notice (but in no event later than 12:00 Noon, Minneapolis, Minnesota time,
with respect to a Floating Rate Advance, and the close of business, with respect
to a Eurodollar Rate Advance, in each case on the Business Day of receipt of
such notice), the Agent shall advise each Bank of the proposed Borrowing. At or
before 2:00 p.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on the date of the requested
Borrowing, each Bank shall provide the Agent at the principal office of the
Agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota with immediately available funds covering such
Bank's Percentage of such Borrowing. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in Article III with respect to such


<PAGE>

Borrowing, the Agent shall pay over such funds to the Borrower prior to the
close of business on the date of the requested Borrowing.

Section 2.3.   Converting Floating Rate Fundings to Eurodollar
Rate Fundings; Procedures. So long as no Default or Event of Default shall
exist, the Borrower may convert all or any part of any outstanding Floating Rate
Funding into a Eurodollar Rate Funding by giving notice to the Agent of such
conversion not later than 10:00 a.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on a Business
Day which is at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of the requested
conversion. Each such notice shall be irrevocable, shall be effective upon
receipt by the Agent, shall be in writing or by telephone or telecopy
transmission, to be confirmed in writing by the Borrower if so requested by the
Agent (in the form of Exhibit C), shall specify the date and amount of such
conversion, the total amount of the Funding to be so converted and the Interest
Period therefor. Each conversion of a Funding shall be on a Business Day, and
the aggregate amount of each such conversion of a Floating Rate Funding to a
Eurodollar Rate Funding shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or a higher
integral multiple of $100,000.

Section 2.4.   Procedures at End of an Interest Period. Unless
the Borrower requests a new Eurodollar Rate Funding in accordance with the
procedures set forth below, or prepay the principal of an outstanding Eurodollar
Rate Funding at the expiration of an Interest Period, each Bank shall
automatically and without request of the Borrower convert each Eurodollar Rate
Funding to a Floating Rate Funding on the last day of the relevant Interest
Period. So long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist, the Borrower may
cause all or any part of any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Funding to continue to
bear interest at a Eurodollar Rate after the end of the then applicable Interest
Period by notifying the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota
time, on a Business Day which is at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
first day of the new Interest Period. Each such notice shall be in writing or by
telephone or telecopy transmission, to be confirmed in writing by the Borrower
if so requested by the Agent (in the form of Exhibit D), shall be irrevocable,
effective when received by the Agent, and shall specify the first day of the
applicable Interest Period, the amount of the expiring Eurodollar Rate Funding
to be continued and the Interest Period therefor. Each new Interest Period shall
begin on a Business Day and the amount of each Funding bearing a new Eurodollar
Rate shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of
$100,000.

Section 2.5.   Setting and Notice of Rates. The applicable
Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Agent on the
second Business Day prior to the beginning of such Interest Period, whereupon
notice thereof (which may be by telephone) shall be given by the Agent to the
Borrower and each Bank. Each such determination of the applicable Eurodollar
Rate shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, in the absence of
demonstrable error. The Agent, upon written request of the Borrower or any Bank,
shall deliver to the Borrower or such requesting Bank a statement showing the
computations used by the Agent in determining the applicable Eurodollar Rate
hereunder.

Section 2.6    Commitment to Issue Letters of Credit. The Letter
of Credit Bank agrees, from the date hereof to and including the Revolving
Commitment Termination Date, to issue one or more standby letters of credit for
the account of the Borrower, and the Banks agree to participate in the risk of
such letters of credit issued for the account of the Borrower hereunder, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth below:

(a)     The Letter of Credit Bank has issued for the account of
Fluoroware the letters of credit identified on Schedule 2.6 attached
hereto, which are presently outstanding with amounts available for
drawing and expiry dates as set forth in Schedule 2.6 (the "Existing
Letters of Credit"). Upon the execution and delivery of the Agreement by
the Borrower, the Borrower hereby irrevocably assumes the obligations of
reimbursement and all other obligations of Fluoroware with respect to
the Existing Letters of Credit and such obligations of the Borrower
shall be evidenced by the Master Agreement for Standby Letters of
Credit.

(b)     Each Existing Letter of Credit and each new letter of
credit issued pursuant to this Section 2.6, shall be referred to herein
as a "Letter of Credit". Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to
the contrary, no Letter of Credit shall be issued by the Letter of
Credit Bank if, after giving effect to the issuance of such Letter of
Credit, (i) the Letter of Credit Amount shall exceed the Letter of
Credit Sublimit or (ii) the Revolving Facility Outstanding Amount shall
exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount. The expiration date of any
Letter of Credit shall not be later than thirty (30) days prior to the
Revolving Commitment Termination Date. Each Letter of Credit will be
issued upon no less than five (5) Business Days' prior written
application from the Borrower to the Letter of Credit Bank. The
application requesting issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be on the
Letter of Credit Bank's standard form or such other form as may be
agreed to by the Letter of Credit Bank and the Borrower. In the event
that any of the terms of such application are inconsistent with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall govern. The Letter of Credit Bank shall not be obligated
to issue a Letter of Credit unless on the date of issuance all
applicable conditions precedent specified in Article III shall have been
satisfied as fully as if the issuance of such Letter of Credit were a
Revolving Advance. Promptly after issuance of a Letter of Credit
pursuant hereto, the Agent shall so advise each Bank of all relevant
information with respect thereto.

(c)     The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the pro
rata account of all Banks, a commission with respect to each Letter of
Credit (herein the "Letter of Credit Fee") at an annual rate equal to
the applicable Letter of Credit Fee Margin with respect to Letters of
Credit in effect on the date payment thereof becomes due and payable
hereunder. The Letter of Credit Fee shall be payable quarterly in
arrears or upon such others terms as may be agreed upon by the Borrower
and the Required Banks at the time of issuance of any such Letter of
Credit; provided, however, that from and after the occurrence of an
Event of Default and continuing thereafter until


<PAGE>

such Event of Default shall be remedied to the written satisfaction of
the Required Banks, the applicable Letter of Credit Fee payable
hereunder with respect to each Letter of Credit shall be equal to the
sum of (i) the applicable Letter of Credit Fee Margin otherwise in
effect with respect to such Letter of Credit and (ii) two percent (2%).
Letter of Credit Fees payable by the Borrower to the Banks in accordance
with this subsection (c) shall be shared among the Banks pro rata in
accordance with their respective Percentages.

(d)     Upon issuance of a Letter of Credit hereunder, and
without any further notice to any Bank, each Bank shall be deemed to,
and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the
Letter of Credit Bank an undivided participating interest in the Letter
of Credit Bank's risk and obligation under such Letter of Credit and in
the obligation of the Letter of Credit Bank to honor drafts thereunder,
and in the amount of any drawing thereunder, and in all rights of the
Letter of Credit Bank to obtain reimbursement from the Borrower in the
amount of such drawing, and all other rights of the Letter of Credit
Bank with respect thereto, in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
sum of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit and the amount of any drawing thereunder, and (ii) the Percentage
of such Bank. Whenever a draft submitted under a Letter of Credit is
paid by the Letter of Credit Bank, the Letter of Credit Bank shall so
notify the Agent, the Agent shall so notify each Bank and shall request
immediate reimbursement from the Borrower for the amount of the draft.
If sufficient funds are not immediately paid to the Agent by the
Borrower, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing
pursuant to Section 2.2 and the Banks shall be notified of such request
in accordance with Section 2.2 and shall fund such request for a
Borrowing as Floating Rate Advances (in accordance with their respective
Percentages) for purposes of reimbursing the Letter of Credit Bank for
the amount of such draft so paid by the Letter of Credit Bank (less any
amounts realized by the Letter of Credit Bank pursuant to the second
sentence of this Section 2.6(d)). If for any reason or under any
circumstance (including, without limitation, the occurrence of a Default
or Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the conditions set
forth in Section 3.2) the Banks do not make such Revolving Advances as
contemplated above and the Borrower does not otherwise reimburse the
Letter of Credit Bank for the amount of the draft so paid by the Letter
of Credit Bank, the Borrower shall nonetheless be obligated to reimburse
the amount of the draft to the Letter of Credit Bank, with interest upon
such amount at the Default Rate from and after the date such draft is
paid by the Letter of Credit Bank until the amount thereof is repaid to
the Letter of Credit Bank in full. If the Letter of Credit Bank shall
not have obtained reimbursement for any drawing under a Letter of Credit
(whether from the Borrower or as proceeds of a Borrowing), upon demand
of the Agent each Bank shall immediately advance the amount of its
participation in such drawing to the Letter of Credit Bank and shall be
entitled to interest on such participating interest at the Default Rate
until reimbursed in full by the Borrower.


<PAGE>

(e)     Each Bank and the Borrower agree that, in paying any
drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit Bank shall not
have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight
draft and certificates expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document
or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such
document. The Letter of Credit Bank shall not be liable to any Bank for:
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or
with the approval of the Banks (including the Required Banks, as
applicable); (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution,
effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document executed in
connection with a Letter of Credit.

(f)     The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or
omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of
any Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to,
and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies
as the Borrower may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or
under any other agreement. The Letter of Credit Bank shall not be liable
or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through
(vii) of subsection (f) below. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing: (i) the Letter of Credit Bank may accept documents that
appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation; and (ii) the Letter of Credit Bank shall not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter
of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any
reason.

(g)     The obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement to
reimburse the Letter of Credit Bank for a drawing under a Letter of
Credit shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

(i)     any lack of validity or enforceability of this
Agreement, the Master Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit or
any letter of credit application;

(ii)    any change in the time, manner or place of
payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the
obligations of the Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit
or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure
from the Master Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit or any
letter of credit application;

(iii)   the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or
other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any
beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any
Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may
be acting), the Letter of Credit Bank or any other Person,


<PAGE>

whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or any unrelated transaction;

(iv)    any draft, demand, certificate or other document
presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or
any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of
Credit;

(v)     any payment by the Letter of Credit Bank under
any Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of any
Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Letter of Credit
Bank under any Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a
trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other
representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any
transferee of any Letter of Credit, including any arising in
connection with any insolvency proceeding;

(vi)    any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent
to departure from any other guarantee, for all or any of the
obligations of the Borrower in respect of any Letter of Credit;
or

(vii)   any other circumstance or happening whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any
other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense
available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower.

(h)     Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.6 to the
contrary, including particularly subsections (f) and (g) above, the
Borrower may have a claim against the Letter of Credit Bank and the
Letter of Credit Bank may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but
only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or
exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves
were caused by the Letter of Credit Bank's willful misconduct or gross
negligence or the willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit
after the presentation to the Letter of Credit Bank by the beneficiary
of a sight draft and certificate strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of a Letter of Credit.

(i)     The Borrower shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnitee from and against all losses, liabilities,
claims, damages, judgments, costs and expenses, including but not
limited to all reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses, incurred
by the Indemnitees or imposed upon the Indemnitees at any time by reason
of the issuance, demand for honor or honor of any Letter of Credit or
the enforcement, protection or collection of the Letter of Credit Bank's
claims against the Borrower under this Section 2.6 or by reason of any
act or omission of any Indemnitee in connection with any of the
foregoing; provided, however, that such indemnification


<PAGE>

shall not extend to losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments,
costs and expenses to the extent arising from any act or omission of an
Indemnitee which constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(j)     The Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the Letter of
Credit Bank, on demand, all administrative fees charged by the Letter of
Credit Bank in the ordinary course of business in connection with the
issuance of letters of credit, honoring of drafts under letters of
credit, amendments thereto, transfers thereof and all other activity
with respect to letters of credit, at the then current rates established
by the Letter of Credit Bank from time to time for such services
rendered on behalf of customers of the Letter of Credit Bank generally.

Section 2.7.   Interest on Obligations. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each unpaid Obligation
for the period commencing on the date of this Agreement until the unpaid
principal amount thereof is paid in full, in accordance with the following:

(a)     Floating Rate Fundings. Subject to subsection (c) below,
while any outstanding principal of a Revolving Note constitutes a
Floating Rate Funding, the outstanding principal balance thereof shall
bear interest at an annual rate at all times equal to the Floating Rate
applicable to such Floating Rate Funding.

(b)     Eurodollar Rate Fundings. Subject to subsection (c)
below, while any outstanding principal of a Revolving Note constitutes a
Eurodollar Rate Funding, the outstanding principal balance thereof shall
bear interest for the applicable Interest Period at an annual rate equal
to the Eurodollar Rate established with respect such Eurodollar Rate
Funding in accordance with Section 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5 hereof.

(c)     Default Rate. From and after the occurrence of an Event
of Default and continuing thereafter until such Event of Default shall
be remedied to the written satisfaction of the Required Banks, the
outstanding principal balance of each Revolving Note shall bear
interest, until paid in full, at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the
interest rate otherwise in effect with respect to such outstanding
principal and (ii) two percent (2%). In addition, all fees,
indemnification obligations and other Obligations not paid when due
hereunder shall bear interest, until paid in full, at an annual rate
equal to the sum of (i) the Floating Rate (with the then applicable
Floating Rate Margin) and (ii) two percent (2%) (each rate described in
this subsection (c) herein a "Default Rate").

Section 2.8.   Obligation to Repay Advances; Representations.
The Borrower shall be obligated to repay all Advances under this Article II
notwithstanding the failure of the Agent to receive any written request therefor
or written confirmation thereof and notwithstanding the fact that the person
requesting the same was not in fact authorized to do so. Any request for a
Borrowing under Section 2.2, whether written, telephonic, telecopy or otherwise,
shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that (a) the amount of
the


<PAGE>

requested Borrowing, when added to the Revolving Facility Outstanding Amount,
would not exceed the Revolving Commitment Amount and (b) the statements set
forth in Section 3.2 are correct as of the time of the request.

Section 2.9.   Revolving Notes. All Revolving Advances made by a
Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by and repayable in accordance with a
Revolving Note issued by the Borrower to such Bank. The aggregate unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Note shall bear interest at the applicable
Floating Rate unless a Eurodollar Rate shall become applicable thereto pursuant
to Sections 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5, and shall be payable on the Maturity Date or
earlier in accordance with Section 7.2.

Section 2.10.  Interest Due Dates. Accrued interest on each
Eurodollar Rate Funding shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period
relating to such Eurodollar Rate Funding; provided, however, that if any
Interest Period is longer than three (3) months, interest shall be payable in
arrears (3) three months, or a whole multiple thereof, after the first day of
such Interest Period and on the last day of the Interest Period. Accrued
interest on each Floating Rate Funding shall be payable in arrears on the last
day of each calendar quarter and at maturity or conversion of such Floating Rate
Funding to a Eurodollar Rate Funding.

Section 2.11.  Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest
accruing on the Revolving Notes and all other fees described in Section 2.12
shall be computed on the basis of actual number of days elapsed in a year of
three hundred sixty (360) days.

Section 2.12.  Fees. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay fees to
the Agent and the Banks, commencing on the date hereof and continuing until all
Obligations are paid in full, in accordance with the following:

(a)     Agent's Administrative Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay
to the Agent, for the sole account of the Agent, a non-refundable
agent's administrative fee (the "Agent's Administrative Fee") in the
amount of $15,000 per year, with such Agent's Administrative Fee being
payable annually in advance on the Closing Date and on each anniversary
of the Closing Date.

(b)     Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent,
for the pro rata account of the Banks, a commitment fee (the "Commitment
Fee") computed at the rate of the applicable Commitment Fee Percentage
per annum on the daily average amount by which the Revolving Commitment
Amount exceeds the Revolving Facility Outstanding Amount, from the
Closing Date to and including the Revolving Commitment Termination Date,
payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each September,
December, March and June, commencing December 31, 1999. Any such
Commitment Fee remaining unpaid on the Revolving Commitment Termination
Date shall be due and payable on such date. The Commitment Fee shall be
shared by the Banks on the basis of their respective Percentages.


<PAGE>

Section 2.13.  Use of Proceeds. The Proceeds of each Borrowing
shall be used by the Borrower for its general corporate purposes and shall be
reloaned by the Borrower to Fluoroware and Empak to be used by Fluoroware and
Empak for their working capital and general corporate purposes.

Section 2.14.  Voluntary Reduction or Termination of the
Revolving Commitments; Prepayments.

(a)     Reduction or Termination of Revolving Commitments. The
Borrower, from time to time upon not less than five (5) Business Days'
prior written notice to the Agent, may permanently reduce the Revolving
Commitment Amount; provided, however, that no such reduction shall
reduce the Revolving Commitment Amount to an amount less than the
Revolving Facility Outstanding Amount. Any such voluntary reduction
shall be pro rata as to all Revolving Commitments according to each
Bank's Percentage of the Revolving Facility and shall be in an aggregate
amount equal to $5,000,000 or a higher integral multiple of $1,000,000.
The Borrower at any time prior to the Revolving Commitment Termination
Date may terminate the Revolving Commitments by (i) providing to the
Agent not less than five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to so terminate the Revolving Commitments and (ii) making
payment in full of all principal and interest on the Revolving Notes and
terminating, or making a cash deposit with respect to, all outstanding
Letters of Credit.

(b)     Prepayments. The Borrower from time to time may
voluntarily prepay the Revolving Notes in whole or in part. In the event
of any voluntary prepayment hereunder (i) any prepayment of the
Revolving Facility shall be applied against outstanding Advances of each
Bank under the Revolving Facility pro rata according to each Bank's
Percentage of the Revolving Facility, (ii) each prepayment of the
Revolving Notes shall be made to the Agent not later than 12:00 Noon,
Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on a Business Day, and funds received after
that hour shall be deemed to have been received by the Agent on the next
following Business Day, (iii) each partial prepayment of Fundings which,
at the time of such prepayment, bear interest at a Eurodollar Rate shall
be accompanied by accrued interest on such partial prepayment through
the date of prepayment and additional compensation calculated in
accordance with Section 2.18, (iv) each partial prepayment of Fundings
which, at the time of such prepayment, bear interest at a Eurodollar
Rate, shall be in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable minimum
Funding amount specified in Section 2.2, and, after application of any
such prepayment, shall not result in a Eurodollar Rate Funding remaining
outstanding in an amount less than such minimum Funding amount, and (v)
each partial prepayment of Fundings which, at the time of such
prepayment, bear interest at a Floating Rate, shall be in an aggregate
amount equal to $500,000 or a higher integral multiple of $500,000,
unless (in either case) the aggregate outstanding balance of all
Revolving Notes being prepaid is less than such minimum Funding amount.


<PAGE>

Section 2.15.  Payments.

(a)     Making of Payments. All payments of principal of and
interest due shall be made to the Agent for the account of the Banks pro
rata according to their respective Percentages; provided, that any such
payments so received by the Agent after the termination of the Revolving
Commitments following the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder
shall be allocated among the Banks pro rata according to their Default
Percentages. All payments of fees pursuant to Section 2.12 shall be made
to the Agent (i) for the account of the Agent as to all amounts
specified in Section 2.12 as payable for the exclusive account of the
Agent and (ii) for the account of the Banks pro rata according to their
respective Percentages as to all fees specified in Section 2.12 as
payable for the account of the Banks. All payments to the Agent shall be
made to the Agent at its office in Minneapolis, Minnesota, not later
than 12:00 Noon, Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on the date due, in
immediately available funds, and funds received after that hour shall be
deemed to have been received by the Agent on the next following Business
Day. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent to charge the Borrower's
demand deposit accounts maintained with the Agent (or with any other
Bank) for the amount of any Obligation on its due date, but the Agent's
failure to so charge any such account shall in no way affect the
obligation of the Borrower to make any such payment. The Agent shall
remit to each Bank in immediately available funds on the same Business
Day as received by the Agent its share of all such payments received by
the Agent for the account of such Bank. If the Agent fails to remit any
payment to any Bank when required hereby, the Agent shall pay interest
on demand to that Bank for each day during the period commencing on the
date such remittance was due until the date such remittance is made at
an annual rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day. All
payments under Section 2.16, 2.17 or 2.18 shall be made by the Borrower
directly to the Bank entitled thereto.

(b)     Effect of Payments. Each payment by the Borrower to the
Agent for the account of any Bank pursuant to Section 2.15(a) shall be
deemed to constitute payment by the Borrower directly to such Bank,
provided, however, that in the event any such payment by the Borrower to
the Agent is required to be returned to the Borrower for any reason
whatsoever, then the Borrower's obligation to such Bank with respect to
such payment shall be deemed to be automatically reinstated.

(c)     Distributions by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have been
notified by a Bank or the Borrower prior to the date on which such Bank
or the Borrower are scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (in the
case of a Bank) the proceeds of an Advance to be made by it hereunder or
(in the case of the Borrower) a payment to the Agent for the account of
one or more of the Banks hereunder (such payment by a Bank or the
Borrower (as the case may be) being herein called a "Required Payment"),
which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that it does not intend to
make the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may assume that the
Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption
(but shall not be


<PAGE>

required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended
recipient(s) on such date and, if such Bank or the Borrower (as the case
may be) has not in fact made the Required Payment to the Agent, the
recipient(s) of such payment shall, on demand, repay to the Agent the
amount so made available together with interest thereon for each day
during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made
available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at
a rate (i) equal to the Federal Funds Rate for such day, in the case of
a Required Payment owing by a Bank, or (ii) equal to the applicable rate
of interest as provided in this Agreement, in the case of a Required
Payment owing by the Borrower.

(d)     Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each Bank, subject to
such Bank's sharing obligations set forth in Section 8.6, shall have all
rights of setoff and bankers' lien provided by applicable law, and in
addition thereto, the Borrower agrees that if at any time any Obligation
is due and owing by the Borrower under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents to any Bank at a time when an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing hereunder, any Bank may apply any and all balances,
credits, and deposits, accounts or moneys of the Borrower then or
thereafter in the possession of such Bank (excluding, however, any trust
or escrow accounts held by the Borrower for the benefit of any third
party) to the payment thereof.

(e)     Due Date Extension. If any payment of principal of or
interest on any Floating Rate Funding or any fees payable hereunder
falls due on a day which is not a Business Day, then such due date shall
be extended to the next following Business Day, and (in the case of
principal) additional interest shall accrue and be payable for the
period of such extension.

(f)     Application of Payments. Except as otherwise provided
herein, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing hereunder, each payment received from the Borrower shall be
applied to such Obligation as the Borrower shall specify by notice to be
received by the Agent on or before the date of such payment, or in the
absence of such notice, as the Agent shall determine in its discretion.
Concurrently with each remittance to any Bank of its appropriate share
of any such payment (based upon such Bank's Percentage), the Agent shall
advise such Bank as to the application of such payment. Except as
otherwise provided in Article VIII, after the termination of the
Revolving Commitments following the occurrence of a Default or Event of
Default, all payments received by the Agent or any Bank from the
Borrower shall be shared on the basis of each Bank's Default Percentage
thereof.

Section 2.16.  Taxes. All payments made by the Borrower to the
Agent or any Bank (herein any "Payee") under or in connection with this
Agreement or the Revolving Notes shall be made without any setoff or other
counterclaim, and shall be free and clear of and without deduction for or on
account of any present or future taxes now or hereafter imposed by any
governmental or other authority, except to the extent that any such deduction or
withholding is compelled by law. As used herein, the term "Taxes" shall include
all


<PAGE>

income, excise and other taxes of whatever nature (other than taxes generally
assessed on the overall net income of a Payee by the government or other
authority of the country, state or political subdivision in which such Payee is
incorporated or in which the office through which such Payee is acting is
located) as well as all levies, imposts, duties, charges, or fees of whatever
nature. "Taxes" shall not include, however, any foreign withholding taxes or
similar deductions imposed solely as a result of a Bank's election to fund an
Advance through a foreign office of such Bank. If the Borrower is compelled by
law to make any deductions or withholdings on account of any Taxes (including
any foreign withholding) the Borrower will:

(a)     pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required
to be so withheld or deducted;

(b)     pay such additional amounts (including, without
limitation, any penalties, interest or expenses) as may be necessary in
order that the net amount received by the Payee after such deductions or
withholdings (including any required deduction or withholding on such
additional amounts) shall equal the amount the Payee would have received
had no such deductions or withholdings been made; and

(c)     promptly forward to the Agent (for delivery to the
appropriate Payee) an official receipt or other documentation
satisfactory to the Agent evidencing such payment to such authorities.

The amount that the Borrower shall be required to pay to any Payee pursuant to
the foregoing clause (b) shall be reduced, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, by the amount of any offsetting tax benefit which such Payee receives as
the result of the Borrower's payment to the relevant authorities as reasonably
determined by such Payee; provided, however, that if such Payee shall
subsequently determine that it has lost the benefit of all or a portion of such
tax benefit, the Borrower shall promptly remit to such Payee the amount
certified by such Payee to be the amount necessary to restore such Payee to the
position it would have been in if no payment had been made pursuant to this
sentence. If any Taxes otherwise payable by the Borrower pursuant to the
foregoing are directly asserted against a Payee, such Payee may pay such taxes
and the Borrower promptly shall reimburse such Payee to the full extent
otherwise required under this Section 2.16. The obligations of the Borrower
under this Section 2.16 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

If circumstances arise in respect of any Bank which would, or
would upon the giving of notice, result in any liability of the Borrower under
this Section 2.16 then, without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise
qualifying the Borrower's obligations under this Section 2.16 such Bank shall
promptly, upon becoming aware of the same, notify the Agent and the Borrower
thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the Borrower and to the
extent that it can do so without, in its reasonable judgment, disadvantaging
itself, take such reasonable steps as may be available to it to mitigate the
effects of such circumstances (including, without limitation, the designation of
an alternate office or the transfer of its Eurodollar Rate Fundings to another
office). If and so long as a Bank has been unable to


<PAGE>

take, or has not taken, steps reasonably acceptable to the Borrower to mitigate
the effect of the circumstances in question, such Bank shall be obliged, at the
request of the Borrower, to assign all its rights and obligations hereunder to
another Person designated by the Borrower with the approval of the Agent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld) which is willing to participate in the
Revolving Facility in place of such Bank; provided that such Person satisfies
all of the requirements of this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
providing the forms and documents required by Section 8.14 and any such Person
shall cover all costs incurred in connection with effecting such replacement.

Section 2.17.  Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy; Funding
Exceptions.

(a)     Increased Costs on Eurodollar Rate Advances. If
Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or
after the date of this Agreement the adoption of any applicable law,
rule or regulation, or any change in any existing law, or any change in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by a Bank with
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any
such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall:

(i)     subject a Bank to or cause the withdrawal or
termination of any exemption previously granted to a Bank with
respect to, any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its
Eurodollar Rate Fundings or its obligation to make Eurodollar
Rate Fundings, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments
to a Bank of the principal of or interest under this Agreement
in respect of its Eurodollar Rate Fundings or its obligation to
make Eurodollar Rate Fundings (except for changes in the rate of
tax on the overall net income of a Bank imposed by the
jurisdictions in which a Bank's principal executive office is
located); or

(ii)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve
(including, without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding any
reserve included in the determination of interest rates pursuant
to Section 2.5), special deposit or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, a Bank; or

(iii)   impose on a Bank any other condition affecting
its making, maintaining or funding of its Eurodollar Rate
Fundings or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Fundings;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to an
affected Bank of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Funding, or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank
under this Agreement or under its Revolving Note with respect to a
Eurodollar Rate Funding, then the affected Bank will notify the


<PAGE>

Borrower and the Agent of such increased cost and within fifteen (15)
days after demand by such Bank (which demand shall be accompanied by a
statement setting forth the basis of such demand) the Borrower shall pay
to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the
Bank for such increased cost or such reduction; provided, however, that
no such increased cost or such reduction shall be payable by the
Borrower for any period longer than ninety (90) days prior to the date
on which notice thereof is delivered to the Borrower. Each Bank will
promptly notify the Borrower of any event of which it has knowledge,
occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Bank to
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.17 If the Borrower receives
notice from a Bank of any event which will entitle such Bank to
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.17 the Borrower may prepay any
then outstanding Eurodollar Rate Fundings or notify the affected Bank
that any pending request for a Eurodollar Rate Funding shall be deemed
to be a request for a Floating Rate Funding, in each case subject to the
provisions of Section 2.18.

(b)     Capital Adequacy. If a Bank determines at any time that
such Bank's Return has been reduced as a result of any Capital Adequacy
Rule Change, such Bank may require the Borrower to pay to such Bank the
amount necessary to restore such Bank's Return to what it would have
been had there been no Capital Adequacy Rule Change. For purposes of
this Section 2.17(b), the following definitions shall apply:

(i)     "Return", for any calendar quarter or shorter
period, means the percentage determined by dividing (A) the sum
of interest and ongoing fees earned by a Bank under this
Agreement during such period by (B) the average capital such
Bank is required to maintain during such period as a result of
its being a party to this Agreement, as determined by such Bank
based upon its total capital requirements and a reasonable
attribution formula that takes account of the Capital Adequacy
Rules then in effect. Return may be calculated for a Bank for
each calendar quarter and for the shorter period between the end
of a calendar quarter and the date of termination in whole of
this Agreement.

(ii)    "Capital Adequacy Rule" means any law, rule,
regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy that applies
to a Bank, or the interpretation thereof by any governmental or
regulatory authority. Capital Adequacy Rules include rules
requiring financial institutions to maintain total capital in
amounts based upon percentages of outstanding loans, binding
loan commitments and letters of credit.

(iii)   "Capital Adequacy Rule Change" means any change
in any Capital Adequacy Rule occurring after the date of this
Agreement, but does not include any changes in applicable
requirements that at the date hereof are scheduled to take place
under the existing Capital Adequacy Rules or any increases in
the capital that a Bank is required to maintain to the extent
that the


<PAGE>

increases are required due to a regulatory authority's
assessment of such Bank's financial condition.

The initial notice sent by a Bank shall be sent as promptly as
practicable after such Bank learns that its Return has been reduced,
shall include a demand for payment of the amount necessary to restore
such Bank's Return for the quarter in which the notice is sent, and
shall state in reasonable detail the cause for the reduction in such
Bank's Return and such Bank's calculation of the amount of such
reduction. Thereafter, a Bank may send a new notice during each calendar
quarter setting forth the calculation of the reduced Return for that
quarter and including a demand for payment of the amount necessary to
restore such Bank's Return for that quarter. A Bank's calculation in any
such notice shall be conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error.

(c)     Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or
Unfair. If with respect to any Interest Period:

(i)     the Agent determines that, or the Required Banks
determine and advise the Agent that, deposits in U.S. dollars
(in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the London
interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period; or

(ii)    the Agent otherwise determines, or the Required
Banks determine and advise the Agent (which determination shall
be binding and conclusive on all parties), that by reason of
circumstances affecting the London interbank eurodollar market
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
applicable Eurodollar Rate; or

(iii)   the Agent determines, or the Required Banks
determine and advise the Agent, that the Eurodollar Rate as
determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect
the cost to the Banks of maintaining or funding a Eurodollar
Rate Funding for such Interest Period, or that the making or
funding of Eurodollar Rate Fundings has become impracticable as
a result of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement
which in the opinion of such Banks materially affects such
Eurodollar Rate Fundings;

then the Agent shall promptly notify the affected parties and (A) in the
event of any occurrence described in the foregoing clause (i) the
Borrower shall enter into good faith negotiations with each affected
Bank in order to determine an alternate method to determine the
Eurodollar Rate for such Bank, and during the pendency of such
negotiations with any Bank, such Bank shall be under no obligation to
make any new Eurodollar Rate Fundings, and (B) in the event of any
occurrence described in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), for so long
as such circumstances shall continue, no Bank shall be under any
obligation to make any new Eurodollar Rate Fundings.


<PAGE>

(d)     Illegality. In the event that any change in (including
the adoption of any new) applicable laws or regulations, or any change
in the interpretation of applicable laws or regulations by any
governmental authority, central bank, comparable agency or any other
regulatory body charged with the interpretation, implementation or
administration thereof, or compliance by a Bank with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank, comparable agency or other regulatory body,
should make it or, in the good faith judgment of the affected Bank,
shall raise a substantial question as to whether it is unlawful for such
Bank to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Fundings, then (i) the
affected Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent, (ii) the
obligation of the affected Bank to make, maintain or convert into
Eurodollar Rate Fundings shall, upon the effectiveness of such event, be
suspended for the duration of such unlawfulness, and (iii) for the
duration of such unlawfulness, any notice by the Borrower pursuant to
Sections 2.3, 2.4 or 2.5 requesting the affected Bank to make or convert
into Eurodollar Rate Fundings shall be construed as a request to make or
to continue making Floating Rate Fundings.

(e)     Procedures to Mitigate. If circumstances arise in
respect of any Bank which would or would upon the giving of notice
result in any liability of the Borrower under this Section 2.17 then,
without in any way limiting, reducing or otherwise qualifying the
Borrower's obligations under this Section 2.17, such Bank shall
promptly, upon becoming aware of the same, notify the Agent and the
Borrower thereof and shall, in consultation with the Agent and the
Borrower and to the extent that it can do so without, in its reasonable
judgment, disadvantaging itself, take such reasonable steps as may be
available to it to mitigate the effects of such circumstances
(including, without limitation, the designation of an alternate office
or the transfer of its Eurodollar Rate Fundings to another office). If
and so long as a Bank has been unable to take, or has not taken, steps
reasonably acceptable to the Borrower to mitigate the effect of the
circumstances in question, such Bank shall be obliged, at the request of
the Borrower, to assign all its rights and obligations hereunder to
another Person designated by the Borrower with the approval of the Agent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and willing to participate in
the Revolving Facility in place of such Bank; provided that such Person
satisfies all of the requirements of this Agreement, including, but not
limited to, providing the forms and documents required by Section 8.14
and any such Person shall cover all costs incurred in connection with
effecting such replacement.

Section 2.18.  Funding Losses. The Borrower hereby agrees that
upon demand by any Bank (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement
setting forth the basis for the calculations of the amount being claimed) the
Borrower will indemnify such Bank against any loss or expense which such Bank
may have sustained or incurred (including, without limitation, any net loss or
expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds acquired by such Bank to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Fundings)
or which such Bank may be deemed to have sustained or incurred, as reasonably
determined


<PAGE>

by such Bank, (i) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any
payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with any Eurodollar
Rate Fundings, (ii) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow or convert any
Eurodollar Rate Fundings on a date specified therefor in a notice thereof or
(iii) due to any payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Funding on a date
other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period for such Eurodollar
Rate Funding. For this purpose, all notices under Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5
shall be deemed to be irrevocable.

Section 2.19.  Right of Banks to Fund through Other Offices.
Each Bank, if it so elects, may fulfill its agreements hereunder with respect to
any Eurodollar Rate Funding by causing a foreign branch or affiliate of such
Bank to make such Eurodollar Rate Funding; provided, that in such event the
obligation of the Borrower to repay such Eurodollar Rate Funding shall
nevertheless be to such Bank and such Eurodollar Rate Funding shall be deemed
held by such Bank for the account of such branch or affiliate.

Section 2.20.  Discretion of Banks as to Manner of Funding.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Bank shall
be entitled to fund and maintain all or any part of its Eurodollar Rate Fundings
in any manner it deems fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes
of this Agreement (specifically including, without limitation, Section 2.18
hereof) all determinations hereunder shall be made as if each Bank had actually
funded and maintained each Eurodollar Rate Funding during each Interest Period
for such Eurodollar Rate Funding through the purchase of deposits having a
maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate
equal to the appropriate Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

Section 2.21.  Conclusiveness of Statements; Survival of
Provisions. Determinations and statements of a Bank pursuant to Section 2.16,
2.17, or 2.18 shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. Each Bank may use
reasonable averaging and attribution methods in determining compensation
pursuant to such Sections 2.16, 2.17 or 2.18 and the provisions of Sections
2.16, 2.17 and 2.18 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Subsidiaries, (iv) result in a breach of or constitute a default under any
indenture or loan or credit agreement or any other material agreement, lease or
instrument to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which it or its properties may be bound or affected, or (v) result in, or
require, the creation or imposition of any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge,

the dates thereof and the results of operations for the periods then ended

applicable, in good faith and by proper proceedings and for which the Borrower
or any such Subsidiary, as applicable, shall have set aside adequate reserves.

ARTICLE VIII

AGREEMENT AMONG BANKS AND AGENT

Section 8.1.   Authorization; Powers. Each Bank irrevocably
appoints and authorizes the Agent to act as administrative agent for and on
behalf of such Bank to the extent provided herein, in any Loan Documents or in
any other document or instrument delivered hereunder or in connection herewith,
and to take such other actions as may be reasonably incidental thereto. The
Agent agrees to act as administrative agent for each Bank upon the express
conditions contained in this Article VIII, but in no event shall the Agent
constitute a fiduciary of any Bank, nor shall the Agent have any fiduciary
responsibilities in respect of any Bank. In furtherance of the foregoing, and
not in limitation thereof, each Bank irrevocably (a) authorizes the Agent to
execute and deliver and perform those obligations under each of the Loan
Documents to which the Agent is a party as are specifically delegated to the
Agent, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies as may be specifically
delegated hereunder or thereunder, together with such additional powers as may
be reasonably incidental thereto, (b) appoints the Agent as nominal beneficiary
or nominal secured party, as the case may be, under the Loan Documents and all
related UCC financing statements (if and to the extent collateral security is
granted with respect to the Obligations), and (c) authorizes the Agent to act as
agent of and for such Bank for purposes of holding, perfecting and disposing of
collateral under the Loan Documents (if and to the extent collateral security is
granted with respect to the Obligations). As to any matters not expressly
provided for by the Loan Documents, the Agent shall not be required to exercise
any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain
from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from
acting) upon the instructions of the Required Banks or, if so required pursuant
to Section 9.2, upon the instructions of all Banks; provided, however, that
except for action expressly required of the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall in
all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it
shall be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action, and the Agent shall not in any event be
required to take any action which is contrary to the Loan Documents or
applicable law.

Section 8.2.   Application of Proceeds. The Agent, after
deduction of any costs of collection, as provided in Section 8.5, shall remit to
each Bank (to the extent a Bank is to share therein) that Bank's pro rata share
of all payments of principal, interest and fees payable hereunder in accordance
with such Bank's appropriate Percentage; provided, however, that all payments
received after the termination of the Revolving Commitments following the
occurrence of an Event of Default, after application to the costs and expenses


<PAGE>

incurred by the Agent or any Bank in collection thereof (as contemplated in
Section 8.5), shall be allocated to the Banks in accordance with their Default
Percentages. Each Bank's interest under the Loan Documents shall be payable
solely from payments, collections and proceeds actually received by the Agent
under the Loan Documents; and the Agent's only liability to a Bank with respect
to any such payments, collections and proceeds shall be to account for such
Bank's Percentage (or Default Percentage, as the case may be) of such payments,
collections and proceeds in accordance with this Agreement. If the Agent is
required for any reason to refund any such payments, collections or proceeds,
each Bank will refund to the Agent, upon demand, its Percentage (or Default
Percentage, as the case may be) of such payments, collections or proceeds,
together with its Percentage (or Default Percentage, as the case may be) of
interest or penalties, if any, payable by the Agent in connection with such
refund. If any Bank has wrongfully refused to fund its Percentage of any
Borrowing, or if the outstanding principal balance of the Advances made by any
Bank is for any other reason less than its respective Percentage of the
aggregate principal balance of all Advances, the Agent may remit payments
received by it to the other Banks until such payments have reduced the aggregate
amounts owed by the Borrower to the extent that the aggregate amount of the
Advances owing to such Bank hereunder are equal to its Percentage of the
aggregate amounts of the Advances owing to all of the Banks hereunder. The
foregoing provision is intended only to set forth certain rules for the
application of payments, proceeds and collections in the event that a Bank has
breached its obligations hereunder and shall not be deemed to excuse any Bank
from such obligations.

Section 8.3.   Exculpation. The Agent shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent in connection with the Loan
Documents, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning legal matters, the
advice of independent public accountants with respect to accounting matters and
advice of other experts as to any other matters and upon any Loan Document and
any schedule, certificate, statement, report, notice or other writing which it
reasonably believes to be genuine or to have been presented by a proper Person.
Neither the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall
be responsible or in any way liable for (a) any recitals, representations or
warranties contained in, or for the execution, validity, genuineness,
effectiveness or enforceability of any Loan Document, or any other instrument or
document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (b) the validity,
genuineness, perfection, effectiveness, enforceability, existence, value of
enforcement of any collateral (if and to the extent collateral security is
granted with respect to the Obligations) or (c) any action taken or omitted by
it. The designation of Norwest as Agent hereunder shall in no way impair or
affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties or obligations
upon, Norwest in its individual capacity as Bank hereunder.

Section 8.4.   Use of the Term "Agent". The term "Agent" is used
herein in reference to the Agent merely as a matter of custom. It is intended to
reflect only an administrative relationship between the Agent and the Banks, in
each case as independent contracting parties. However, the obligations of the
Agent shall be limited to those expressly


<PAGE>

set forth herein and in no event shall the use of such term create or imply any
fiduciary relationship or any other obligation arising under the general law of
agency.

Section 8.5.   Reimbursement for Costs and Expenses. All
payments, collections and proceeds received or effected by the Agent may be
applied first to pay or reimburse the Agent for all reasonable costs and
expenses at any time incurred by or imposed upon the Agent in connection with
this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including but not limited to all
reasonable attorney's fees (including allocated costs of in-house counsel),
foreclosure expenses and advances made to protect the security of any collateral
(if and to the extent collateral security is granted with respect to the
Obligations), but excluding any costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent). If the Agent does
not receive payments, collections or proceeds sufficient to cover any such costs
and expenses within five (5) days after their incurrence or imposition, each
Bank shall, upon demand, remit to the Agent such Bank's Percentage of the
difference between (i) such costs and expenses and (ii) such payments,
collections and proceeds, together with interest on such amount for each day
following the thirtieth day after demand therefor until so remitted at a rate
equal to the Federal Funds Rate for each such day.

Section 8.6.   Payments Received Directly by Banks. If any Bank
shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by
application of offset or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Facility or on
account of any fees under this Agreement (other than through distributions made
in accordance with Section 8.2 hereof) in excess of such Bank's applicable
Percentage with respect to the Revolving Facility (or such Bank's Default
Percentage, if applicable), such Bank shall promptly give notice of such fact to
the Agent and shall promptly remit to the Agent such amount as shall be
necessary to cause the remitting Bank to share such excess payment or other
recovery ratably with each of the Banks in accordance with their respective
Percentages, (or Default Percentages, as the case may be) together with interest
for each day on such amount until so remitted at a rate equal to the Federal
Funds Rate for each such day; provided, however, that if all or any portion of
the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such remitting
Bank or holder, the remittance shall be restored to the extent of such recovery.

Section 8.7.   Indemnification. Each Bank severally (but not
jointly) hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, as well as the
Agent's agents, employees, officers and directors, ratably according to their
respective Percentages from and against any and all losses, liabilities
(including liabilities for penalties), actions, suits, judgment, demands,
damages, costs, disbursements, or expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses)(including allocated costs of in-house counsel)) of any kind or nature
whatsoever, which are imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent or
its agents, employees, officers or directors in any way relating to or arising
out of the Loan Documents, or as a result of any action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Agent; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for any
portion of any such losses, liabilities (including liabilities for penalties),
actions, suits, judgments, demands, damages, costs disbursements, or expenses
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent.
Notwithstanding any

other provision of the Loan Documents, the Agent shall in all cases be fully
justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense that
may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

Section 8.8.   Agent and Affiliates. Norwest shall have the same
rights and powers in its capacity as a Bank hereunder as any other Bank, and may
exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the Agent,
and Norwest and its affiliates may accept deposits from and generally engage in
any kind of business with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any affiliate of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as fully as if Norwest were not the Agent
hereunder.

Section 8.9.   Credit Investigation. Each Bank acknowledges that
it has made such inquiries and taken such care on its own behalf as would have
been the case had its Revolving Commitment been granted and its Advances made
directly by such Bank to the Borrower without the intervention of the Agent or
any other Bank. Each Bank agrees and acknowledges that the Agent makes no
representations or warranties about the creditworthiness of the Borrower or any
other party to this Agreement or with respect to the legality, validity,
sufficiency or enforceability of this Agreement, any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith.

Section 8.10.  Defaults. The Agent shall have no duty to inquire
into any performance or failure to perform by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries
and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default (other than under Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b) or 7.1(c)) hereof
unless the Agent has received notice from a Bank or the Borrower specifying the
occurrence of such Default or Event of Default. In the event that the Agent
receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default,
the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. In the event of any
Default, the Agent shall (subject to Section 8.7 hereof) (a) in the case of a
Default that constitutes an Event of Default, not take any the actions referred
to in Section 7.2(b) hereof unless so directed by the Required Banks, and (b) in
the case of any Default, take such actions with respect to such Default as shall
be directed by the Required Banks; provided that, unless and until the Agent
shall have received such directions, the Agent may take any action, or refrain
from taking any action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable
in the best interest of the Banks.

Section 8.11.  Obligations Several. The obligations of each Bank
hereunder are the several obligations of such Bank, and neither any Bank nor the
Agent shall be responsible for the obligations of any other Bank hereunder, nor
will the failure by the Agent or any Bank to perform any of its obligations
hereunder relieve the Agent or any other Bank from the performance of its
respective obligations hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no
action taken by any Bank or the Agent pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
or pursuant to or in connection with the Loan Documents shall be deemed to


<PAGE>

constitute the Banks, together or with or without the Agent, as a partnership,
association, joint venture, or other entity.

Section 8.12.  Sale or Assignment; Addition of Banks. Except as
permitted under the terms and conditions of this Section 8.12 or, with respect
to participations, under Section 8.13, no Bank may sell, assign or transfer its
rights or obligations under this Agreement or its interest in any Revolving
Note. Any Bank, at any time upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written
notice to the Agent and the Borrower (unless the Agent and the Borrower consent
to a shorter period of time), may assign all or a portion (provided such portion
is not less than $5,000,000) of such Bank's Revolving Note, Advances and
Revolving Commitment to a domestic or foreign bank (having a branch office in
the United States), an insurance company or other financial institution (an
"Applicant") on any date (the "Adjustment Date") selected by such Bank, but only
so long as the Borrower and the Agent shall have provided their prior written
approval of such proposed Applicant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
Borrower will not unreasonably withhold their consent to any such assignment,
(ii) no such consent of the Borrower shall be required after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, and (iii) no such consent of the
Borrower or the Agent shall be required in connection with an assignment to the
Federal Reserve Bank for purposes of satisfying a Bank's capital requirements.
Upon receipt of such approval and to confirm the status of each additional Bank
as a party to this Agreement and to evidence the assignment in accordance
herewith:

(a)     the Agent, the Borrower (if the Borrower's consent is
required), the assigning Bank and such Applicant shall, on or before the
Adjustment Date, execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment
Certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit G (an "Assignment
Certificate");

(b)     if requested by the Agent, the Borrower will execute and
deliver to the Agent, for delivery by the Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Assignment Certificate, (i) a new Revolving Note payable to
the order of the Applicant in the amount corresponding to the applicable
Revolving Commitment acquired by such Applicant and (ii) a new Revolving
Note payable to the order of the assigning Bank in the amount
corresponding to the retained Revolving Commitment. Such new Revolving
Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal
amount of the Revolving Notes to be replaced by such new Revolving
Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such assignment and shall
otherwise be in the form of the Revolving Note to be replaced thereby.
Such new Revolving Notes shall be issued in substitution for, but not in
satisfaction or payment of, the Revolving Note being replaced thereby
and such new Revolving Notes shall be treated as Revolving Notes for
purposes of this Agreement; and

(c)     the assigning Bank shall pay to the Agent an
administrative fee of $3,000.


<PAGE>

Upon the execution and delivery of such Assignment Certificate and such new
Revolving Notes, and effective as of the effective date thereof (i) this
Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, and only to the extent,
necessary to reflect the addition of such additional Bank and the resulting
adjustment of the Percentages arising therefrom, (ii) the assigning Bank shall
be relieved of all obligations hereunder to the extent of the reduction of the
assigning Bank's Percentage, and (iii) the Applicant shall become a party hereto
and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded to a Bank
herein and in each other Loan Document or other document or instrument executed
pursuant hereto and subject to all obligations of a Bank hereunder, including,
without limitation, the right to approve or disapprove actions which, in
accordance with the terms hereof, require the approval of the Required Banks or
all Banks. In order to facilitate the addition of additional Banks hereto, the
Borrower (subject to their approval rights hereunder, if any) and the Banks
shall cooperate fully with the Agent in connection therewith and shall provide
all reasonable assistance requested by the Agent relating thereto, including,
without limitation, the furnishing of such written materials and financial
information regarding the Borrower as the Agent may reasonably request, the
execution of such documents as the Agent may reasonably request with respect
thereto, and the participation by officers of the Borrower, and the Banks in a
meeting or teleconference call with any Applicant upon the request of the Agent.

Section 8.13.  Participation. In addition to the rights granted
in Section 8.12, each Bank may grant participations in all or a portion of its
Revolving Note, Advances and Revolving Commitment to any domestic or foreign
commercial bank (having a branch office in the United States), insurance
company, financial institution or an affiliate of such Bank. No holder of any
such participation shall be entitled to require any Bank to take or omit to take
any action hereunder. The Banks shall not, as among the Borrower, the Agent and
the Banks, be relieved of any of their respective obligations hereunder as a
result of any such granting of a participation. The Borrower hereby acknowledges
and agrees that any participation described in this Section 8.13 may rely upon,
and possess all rights under, any opinions, certificates, or other instruments
or documents delivered under or in connection with any Loan Document. Except as
set forth in this Section 8.13, no Bank may grant any participation in its
Revolving Note, Advances or Revolving Commitment.

Section 8.14.  Withholding Tax Exemption. At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable
hereunder for the account of any Bank, each Bank that is not incorporated under
the laws of the United States of America, or a state thereof, agrees that it
will deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United
States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case
that such Bank is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the
Revolving Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes. Each Bank which so delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes
to deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two additional copies of such form (or
a successor form) on or before the date that such form expires (currently, three
successive calendar years for Form 1001 and one calendar year for Form 4224) or
becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent forms so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or


<PAGE>

extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or
the Agent, in each case certifying that such Bank is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement and the Revolving Notes without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event
(including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such
Bank from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
such Bank advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving
payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income
tax.

Section 8.15.  Borrower not a Beneficiary or Party. Except with
respect to the limitation of liability applicable to the Banks under Section
8.11 and the Borrower's right to approve additional Banks in accordance with
Section 8.12, the provisions and agreements in this Article VIII are solely
among the Banks and the Agent and the Borrower shall not be considered a party
thereto or a beneficiary thereof.

ARTICLE IX

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1.   No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure or
delay on the part of the Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power or
remedy under the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy
under the Loan Documents. The remedies provided in the Loan Documents are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

Section 9.2.   Amendments, Requested Waivers, Etc. No amendment,
modification, termination or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or
consent to any departure by the Borrower or either of the Guarantors therefrom
shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Required Banks and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby,
by the Agent; provided that no amendment, modification, termination, waiver or
consent shall do any of the following unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by all Banks: (a) change the amount of any Revolving Commitment (except
as permitted in accordance with Section 8.12), (b) increase the Revolving
Commitment Amount, (c) reduce the amount of any principal of or interest due on
any Advances or any fees payable to the Banks hereunder, (d) postpone any date
fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any outstanding Advances or
any fees payable to the Banks hereunder, (e) change the definition of "Required
Banks," (f) amend this Section 9.2 or any other provision of this Agreement
requiring the consent or other action of the Required Banks or all Banks, (g)
release the Guaranties or (h) release, subordinate or terminate any security
interest in or mortgage lien on any collateral (if and to the extent collateral
security is granted with respect to the Obligations). Any waiver or consent
given hereunder shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
specific purpose for


<PAGE>

which given. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle
the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

Section 9.3.   Addresses for Notices, Etc. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, all notices, requests, demands and other
communications provided for under the Loan Documents shall be in writing and
mailed or delivered to the applicable parties at their respective addresses set
forth on the execution pages hereto, or, as to each party, at such other address
as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party
complying as to delivery with the terms of this Section 9.3. All such notices,
requests, demands and other communications, when delivered, shall be effective
upon actual delivery and when mailed, shall be effective when sent by nationally
recognized overnight mail courier or delivery service, addressed as aforesaid,
except that notices or requests to the Agent or any Bank pursuant to any of the
provisions of Article II shall not be effective until received by the Agent or
such Bank.

Section 9.4.   Costs and Expenses. The Borrower will reimburse
the Agent for (a) any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses (including
allocated costs of in-house counsel), lien and UCC searches, title and recording
expenses and other similar expenses, paid or incurred by the Agent in connection
with the preparation, filing or recording of the Loan Documents and any other
document or agreement related hereto or thereto, and the transactions
contemplated hereby (which amount shall be paid on the Closing Date or as soon
thereafter as demand is made therefor) and the negotiation of any amendments,
modifications or extensions to or of any of the foregoing documents, instruments
or agreements and the preparation of any and all documents necessary or
desirable to effect such amendments, modifications or extensions, (b) customary
transaction fees of the Agent incurred in connection with the loans contemplated
hereby, (c) reasonable fees in connection with any audits or inspections by the
Agent of any collateral (if and to the extent collateral security is granted
with respect to the Obligations) or the operations or business of the Borrower
and/or its Subsidiaries, whether conducted at the premises of the Borrower
and/or its Subsidiaries or at the Agent's premises, and (d) any and all other
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower will reimburse
the Agent and each Bank for any and all costs and expenses incurred by the Agent
or any Bank in connection with the enforcement of any of the rights or remedies
of the Agent or the Banks under any of the Loan Documents or under applicable
law, whether or not suit is filed with respect thereto.

Section 9.5.   Indemnity. In addition to the payment of expenses
pursuant to Section 9.4, the Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Agent, each Bank and each of their respective participants, parent
corporations, subsidiary corporations, affiliated corporations, successor
corporations, and all present and future officers, directors, employees and
agents (the "Indemnitees"), from and against (i) any claim, loss or damage to
which any Indemnitee may be subjected as a result of any past, present or future
existence, use, handling, storage, transportation or disposal of any Hazardous
Substance by the


<PAGE>

Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any property owned,
leased or controlled by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any and
all transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or charges made by any
governmental authority (excluding income or gross receipts taxes) by reason of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or the
making of any Advances and (iii) any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
penalties, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel) in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial
proceedings, whether or not such Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto,
which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitee, in any
manner relating to or arising out of or in connection with, the making of any
Advances or entering into this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or the use
or intended use of the proceeds of the Advances, excepting, however, from the
foregoing any such liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits,
claims, costs and expenses resulting solely from the willful misconduct or gross
negligence of any Indemnitee. If any investigative, judicial or administrative
proceeding arising from any of the foregoing is brought against any Indemnitee,
upon request of such Indemnitee, the Borrower, or counsel designated by the
Borrower and satisfactory to the Indemnitee, will resist and defend such action,
suit or proceeding to the extent and in the manner directed by the Indemnitee,
at the Borrower's sole cost and expense. Each Indemnitee will use its best
efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding. If
the foregoing undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless may be held to
be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, the Borrower
shall nevertheless make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction
of each of the indemnified liabilities contemplated hereby which is permissible
under applicable law. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.5
shall survive termination of this Agreement and the discharge of the
Obligations.

Section 9.6.   Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement and
other Loan Documents may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all
of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
instrument.

Section 9.7.   Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial.

(a)     Governing Law. The Loan Documents shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota,
except to the extent the law of any other jurisdiction applies as to the
perfection or enforcement of the any security interest in any collateral
(if and to the extend collateral security is granted with respect to the
Obligations) and except to the extent expressly provided to the contrary
in any Loan Document.

(b)     Jurisdiction. The Borrower, the Agent and the Banks
hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the State of Minnesota in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement


<PAGE>

or any of the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower, the Agent and the
Banks hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in such state or federal
court. The Borrower, the Agent and the Banks hereby irrevocably waive,
to the fullest extent they may effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The
Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Section 9.7(b) shall
affect the right of the Agent or any Bank to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law or affect the right of the Agent or any
Bank to bring any action or proceeding against the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries or the property of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in the courts of other jurisdictions.

(c)     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE BANKS AND THE
AGENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN
DOCUMENT OR ANY INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED THEREUNDER.

Section 9.8.   Integration; Inconsistency. This Agreement,
together with the Loan Documents, comprise the final and complete integration of
all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and shall constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to such subject matter, superseding all prior oral or written
understandings. If any provision of a Loan Document is inconsistent with or
conflicts with a comparable or similar provision appearing in this Agreement,
the comparable or similar provision in this Agreement shall govern.

Section 9.9.   Agreement Effectiveness. This Agreement shall
become effective upon delivery of fully executed counterparts hereof to each of
the parties hereto.

Section 9.10.  Advice from Independent Counsel. The parties
hereto understand that this Agreement is a legally binding agreement that may
affect such party's rights. Each party hereto represents to the other that it
has received legal advice from counsel of its choice regarding the meaning and
legal significance of this Agreement and that it is satisfied with its legal
counsel and the advice received from it.

Section 9.11.  Binding Effect; No Assignment by Borrower. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the
Banks, the Agent and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however,
the Borrower may assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder or any
of its interest herein without the prior written consent of all Banks.

Section 9.12.  Severability of Provisions. Any provision of this
Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof.


<PAGE>

Section 9.13.  Headings. Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

2.01 The Loans. (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Bank with a Commitment severally agrees, at any time commencing on
the date hereof to but not including the Commitment Termination Date, to make
loans (each, a "Loan"


10
<PAGE>

and collectively, as the context requires, the "Loans") to each Borrower in
Dollars, which Loans (i) shall, at the option of such Borrower, be Base Rate
Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, provided that, except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 2.10(b), all Loans comprising the same
Borrowing shall at all times be of the same Type, and (ii) may be repaid,
prepaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof; provided,
however, that the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding from any Bank
shall at no time exceed (after giving effect to the use of the proceeds of any
Loan then being made) an amount equal to the Commitment of such Bank at such
time. More than one Borrowing may occur on the same date.

(b) [Intentionally Omitted]

(c) [Intentionally Omitted]

(d) Anything in this Section 2.01 to the contrary notwithstanding, the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans outstanding at the same time
shall not exceed the Total Commitment at such time.

(e) [Intentionally Omitted]

2.02 Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing. The aggregate principal amount of
each Borrowing hereunder shall be not less than $10,000,000 or a larger whole
multiple of $1,000,000 for each such Loan, except as required by Section
2.10(b). Borrowings of Loans of different Types or, in the case of Eurocurrency
Rate Loans, having different Interest Periods, at the same time hereunder shall
be deemed separate Borrowings.

2.03 Notice of Borrowing. Whenever either Borrower desires to make a
Borrowing hereunder, it shall give the Administrative Agent notice thereof at
its Notice Office by noon (New York time) on the date three Business Days prior
to each Eurocurrency Rate Loan and by noon (New York time) on the date of each
Base Rate Loan. Each such notice (each a "Notice of Borrowing") shall be in the
form of Exhibit A, appropriately completed to specify the aggregate principal
amount of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, the date of such
Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), whether the Loans being made pursuant
to such Borrowing are to be maintained as Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate
Loans and, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, the Interest Period to be
applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Bank
notice of such proposed Borrowing, of such Bank's proportionate share thereof
and of the other matters required by the immediately preceding sentence to be
specified in the Notice of Borrowing.

2.04 Disbursement of Funds. No later than 2:00 p.m. (New York time) on the
date specified in each Notice of Borrowing for Base Rate Loans and noon (New
York time) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing for Eurocurrency
Rate Loans, each Bank will make available, through such Bank's Applicable
Lending Office, its pro rata portion of each Borrowing requested to be made on
such date by either Borrower under Section 2.01, in immediately available funds
at the Payment Office of the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent
will make available to such Borrower at its Payment Office the aggregate


11
<PAGE>

of the amounts so made available by the Banks in immediately available funds.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Bank prior to
the date of Borrowing that such Bank does not intend to make available to the
Administrative Agent such Bank's portion of any Borrowing to be made on such
date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such amount
available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is
not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from
such Bank on demand. If such Bank does not pay such corresponding amount
forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower and such Borrower shall
immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover on demand from such Bank
or the relevant Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding
amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made
available by the Administrative Agent to such Borrower until the date such
corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per
annum equal to (i) if recovered from such Bank, the cost to the Administrative
Agent of funding the relevant amount and (ii) if recovered from such Borrower,
the then applicable rate for Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as the
case may be. Nothing in this Section 2.04 shall be deemed to release any Bank
from its obligation to make Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the
relevant Borrower may have against any Bank as a result of any failure by such
Bank to make Loans hereunder.

2.05 Notes. (a) (a) The obligation of each Borrower to pay the principal
of, and interest on, the Loans made by each Bank to such Borrower shall be
evidenced by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by such Borrower
substantially in the form of Exhibit B with blanks appropriately completed in
conformity herewith (each, a "Note" and, collectively, the "Notes").

(b) The Note issued to each Bank shall (i) be payable to such Bank and be
dated the date of this Agreement, (ii) mature, with respect to each Loan
evidenced thereby, in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, on the last day of
its Interest Period, and in the case of a Base Rate Loan, on the Commitment
Termination Date, (iii) bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of
Section 2.08 in respect of the Base Rate Loans and Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as
the case may be, evidenced thereby and (iv) be entitled to the benefits of this
Agreement and the Guaranty.

(c) [Intentionally Omitted]

(d) [Intentionally Omitted]

(e) [Intentionally Omitted]

(f) Each Bank will note on its internal records the amount of each Loan
made by it and each payment in respect thereof and will prior to any transfer of
its Note endorse on the


12
<PAGE>

reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of Loans evidenced
thereby. Failure to make any such notation shall not affect the relevant
Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans.

2.06 Conversions. Each Borrower shall have the option to convert on any
Business Day all or a portion equal to at least $5,000,000 of the outstanding
principal amount of the Base Rate Loans made to such Borrower pursuant to one or
more Borrowings into a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, provided that (i)
no Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion and
(ii) no conversion pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall result in a greater
number of Borrowings than is permitted under Section 2.01. Each such conversion
shall be effected by the relevant Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at
its Notice Office prior to noon (New York time) at least three Business Days'
prior notice (a "Notice of Conversion") specifying the Base Rate Loans to be so
converted and the Interest Period to be applicable thereto. The Administrative
Agent shall give each Bank prompt notice of any such proposed conversion
affecting any of its Base Rate Loans.

2.07 Pro Rata Borrowings. All Borrowings under this Agreement shall be
incurred from the Banks pro rata on the basis of their Commitments. It is
understood that no Bank shall be responsible for any default by any other Bank
of its obligation to make Loans hereunder and that each Bank shall be obligated
to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder regardless of the failure
of any other Bank to make its Loans hereunder.

2.08 Interest. (a) Each Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the
unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan made to such Borrower from the
date the proceeds thereof are made available to such Borrower until the maturity
thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall
be the Base Rate in effect from time to time.

(b) Each Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made to such Borrower from the
date the proceeds thereof are made available to such Borrower until the maturity
thereof (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall,
during the Interest Period applicable thereto, be the Eurocurrency Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.

(c) [Intentionally Omitted]

(d) [Intentionally Omitted]

(e) Subject to Section 12.09, overdue principal and overdue interest in
respect of each Loan and any other overdue amount payable by any Borrower
hereunder shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2% per annum in
excess of the Base Rate in effect from time to time; provided, however, that no
Loan shall bear interest after maturity at a rate per annum, less than 2% in
excess of the rate of interest applicable thereto at maturity.

(f) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i) in
respect of each Base Rate Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of
each March, June,


13
<PAGE>

September and December, (ii) in respect of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan, on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an
Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three month
intervals after the first day of such Interest Period, and (iii) in respect of
each Loan, on any prepayment (on the amount prepaid), at maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

(g) On each Interest Determination Date, the Administrative Agent shall
determine the interest rate for the Eurocurrency Rate Loans for which such
determination is being made, and shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower and
the Banks thereof. Each such determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

2.09 Interest Periods. At the time it gives any Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion in respect of the making of, or conversion into any
Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the relevant Borrower shall have the right to elect, by
giving the Administrative Agent notice thereof, the interest period or interest
periods (each, an "Interest Period") applicable to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan,
each of which shall, at the option of such Borrower, be a one, two, three, six
or (subject to availability as determined by 100% of the Banks) nine month
period, provided that: (i) all Eurocurrency Rate Loans comprising a Borrowing
shall at all times have the same Interest Period except as otherwise required by
Section 2.10(b); (ii) the Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall
commence on the date of Borrowing of such Loan (including the date of any
conversion of a Base Rate Loan into Eurodollar Rate Loan); (iii) if the Interest
Period relating to a Eurocurrency Rate Loan begins on a day for which there is
no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such
Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of such
calendar month; (iv) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day
which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
succeeding Business Day; provided, however, that if the Interest Period for a
Eurocurrency Rate Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business
Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such
month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day; and
(v) no Interest Period shall extend beyond the Commitment Termination Date.

2.10 Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that any Bank
shall have determined (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to
clause (i) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent):

(i) on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any
changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the London
interbank market for deposits in Dollars, adequate and fair means do not
exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided
for in the definition of Eurocurrency Rate; or

(ii) at any time, that such Bank shall incur increased costs or
reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to
any Eurocurrency Rate Loan because of (x) any change since the date hereof
in any applicable law or


14
<PAGE>

governmental rule, regulation, order or request (whether or not having the
force of law) (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and
including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule,
regulation, order or request), such as, for example, but not limited to,
(1) a change in the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank or its
Applicable Lending office of the principal of or interest on the Notes or
any other amounts payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax
on, or determined by reference to, the net income or profits of such Bank
or its Applicable Lending Office imposed by any jurisdiction in which its
principal office or Applicable Lending Office is located) or (2) a change
in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves
required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of
the Eurocurrency Rate, and/or (y) other circumstances affecting such Bank
or the interbank Eurocurrency market, or the position of such Bank in such
market; or

(iii) at any time, that the making of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan has
been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or
order, (y) impossible by compliance by such Bank with any governmental
request (whether or not having force of law) or (z) impracticable as a
result of a contingency occurring after the date of this Agreement which
materially and adversely affects the London interbank market for Dollar
deposits;

then, and in any such event, such Bank (or the Administrative Agent, in the case
of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone confirmed in
writing) to the Borrowers, accompanied by an explanation of the basis therefor,
and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the Administrative Agent of such
determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to
each of the other Banks). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above,
Eurocurrency Rate Loans of the maturities identified by the Administrative Agent
in such notice as unavailable shall no longer be available until such time as
the Administrative Agent notifies the relevant Borrower and the Banks that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer
exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given by the relevant
Borrower with respect to its affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans which have not yet
been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by such
Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the Borrower to whom the
Eurocurrency Rate Loan was made shall pay to such Bank, upon written demand
therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Bank in its sole
discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Bank for
such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder
(a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Bank, showing the
basis for the calculation thereof, certified to such Borrower by such Bank
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the
parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, take one of the
actions specified in Section 2.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event,
within the time period required by law.

(b) At any time that any Eurocurrency Rate Loan is affected by the
circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower to whom
such Loan was


15
<PAGE>

made may (and in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan affected by the
circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(iii) shall) either (i) if the
affected Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion cancel
said Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed
in writing) of the cancellation on the same date that such Borrower was notified
by the Bank or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii)
or (ii) if the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loan is then outstanding, upon at
least three Business Days' written notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay
the Eurocurrency Rate Loans of the affected Bank and reborrow the same as Base
Rate Loans, provided that, if more than one Bank is affected at any time, then
all affected Banks must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 2.10(b).

(c) If any Bank determines at any time that any applicable law or
governmental rule, regulation order or request (whether or not having the force
of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency, which shall have become effective or applicable after the date hereof,
will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital required or expected to
be maintained by such Bank or a holding company of which such Bank is a
Subsidiary based on the existence of such Bank's Commitment hereunder or its
obligations hereunder, then the Borrowers shall pay to such Bank upon its
written demand therefor, such additional amounts as shall be required to
compensate such Bank or such holding company for the increased cost to such Bank
as a result of such increase of capital; such obligations of the Borrowers shall
be joint and several. In determining such additional amounts, each Bank will act
reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods
which are reasonable, provided that such Bank's determination of compensation
owing under this Section 2.10(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Bank, upon determining
that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(c),
will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrowers, which notice shall
show the basis for calculation of such additional amounts, although the failure
to give any such notice shall not release or diminish any of the Borrowers'
obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.10(c), absent
manifest error.

2.11 Compensation. Each Borrower shall compensate each Bank, upon its
written request (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such
compensation), for all reasonable losses, expenses and liabilities (including,
without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Bank to
fund its Eurocurrency Rate Loans) which such Bank may sustain: (i) if for any
reason (other than a default by such Bank or the Administrative Agent) a
Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor
in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion (whether or not withdrawn by
the relevant Borrower or deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section 2.10(a)); (ii) if
any repayment (including any repayment made pursuant to Section 2.04 and any
prepayment made pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.02) occurs on a date which is not
the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto; (iii) if any
prepayment of any of its Eurocurrency Rate Loans is not made on any date
specified in a notice of prepayment given by the relevant Borrower; or (iv) as a
consequence of (x) any other default by the relevant Borrower


16
<PAGE>

to repay its Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note of
such Bank or (y) any prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.10(b).

2.12 Change of Applicable Lending Office. Each Bank agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of or a payment obligation
of either Borrower under Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), 2.10(c) or 5.04 with
respect to such Bank, such Bank will, if requested by either of the Borrowers,
use its best efforts to designate another Applicable Lending Office for any
Loans affected by such event, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the
event giving rise to the operation of any such Section; provided that no such
designation shall be made if, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, such Bank
would suffer any administrative, economic, legal, tax or regulatory
disadvantage. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the
obligations of the Borrowers or the right of any Bank provided in Section 2.10
or 5.04.

Termination Date; Extension of Commitments; Increase of Commitments.

4.01 Fees. (a) (a) The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent on the dates set forth below, for distribution to the
Banks, a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") for the period from the date of this
Agreement until the Commitment Termination Date (or such earlier date as the
Total Commitment shall have been terminated) computed at the Applicable Facility
Fee Rate on the Total Commitment. Accrued Facility Fees shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the third Business Day of each April, July, October and
January of each year, for the calendar quarter ending most recently prior to
such payment date, and on the Commitment Termination Date or upon such earlier
date as the Total Commitment shall be terminated.

(b) The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent on the date of this Agreement, for distribution to each Bank, such fees as
may be agreed in writing between the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the
Banks.

(c) [Intentionally Omitted]

(d) The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, such fees as may be agreed to from time to time between the Borrowers
and the Administrative Agent.


17
<PAGE>

4.02 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. (a) (a) On the Commitment
Termination Date, the Total Commitment (and the Commitment of each Bank) shall
terminate in its entirety.

(b) Upon at least five Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative
Agent at its Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly
transmit to each of the Banks), the Guarantor shall have the right, without
premium or penalty, to reduce or terminate the Total Commitment in whole or in
part, in integral multiples of $10,000,000 or lesser whole multiples of
$1,000,000; provided that any such reduction or termination must be applied to
reduce the Total Commitment on a pro rata basis and (ii) no such reduction of
the Total Commitment shall reduce the Total Commitment to less than the
aggregate amount of the Loans then outstanding.

4.03 Commitment Termination Date; Extension of Commitments. (a) The
"Commitment Termination Date" shall be April 28, 2000 or such later date to
which the Commitment Termination Date has been extended pursuant to this Section
4.03.

(b) The Guarantor may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall
promptly so notify the Banks) given not earlier than 60 days and not later than
45 days before the Commitment Termination Date then in effect (the "Existing
Commitment Termination Date"), request that the Banks extend the Commitment
Termination Date for an additional 364 days from the Consent Date (as
hereinafter defined). Such request shall be accompanied by a certificate of a
senior officer of the Guarantor stating that no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and that since the date of the annual consolidated
financial statements received by the Banks pursuant to Section 7(a) of the
Guaranty most immediately prior to the date of such request, there has been no
material adverse change in the business, operations, property, assets, condition
(financial or otherwise) or (to the knowledge of the Guarantor) prospects of the
Guarantor or of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Each Bank
which, in its sole discretion, agrees to so extend the Commitment Termination
Date and its Commitment (an "Extending Bank") shall notify the Administrative
Agent in writing of such Bank's agreement to such extension not earlier than 45
days and not later than 35 days prior to the Existing Commitment Termination
Date, such notice to be revocable until the Consent Date, whereupon it will
become irrevocable. Any Bank that fails to so notify the Administrative Agent
shall be deemed to have declined to agree to the requested extension (such
Banks, together with such Banks as shall have notified the Administrative Agent
of their decision not to so extend the Commitment Termination Date and their
respective Commitments, the "Non-Extending Banks"). The Administrative Agent
shall promptly, and in any event not later than 30 days prior to the Existing
Commitment Termination Date (the "Consent Date"), notify the Guarantor of the
Banks' respective decisions.

(c) The Guarantor shall have the right, during the period commencing on
the Consent Date and ending three Business Days prior to the Existing Commitment
Termination Date (the "Determination Date"), to replace the Commitments of the
Non-Extending Banks with such additional Commitments as the Extending Banks may
irrevocably agree, by notice to the


18
<PAGE>

Administrative Agent, to make. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give the
Guarantor notice of any such irrevocable agreement. If the aggregate amount of
such additional Commitments from Extending Banks is less than the aggregate
amount of the Commitments of the Non-Extending Banks, the Guarantor shall have
the right to add to this Agreement one or more new banks to replace such
difference in Commitments (each Extending Bank so agreeing and each such new
bank, an "Additional Commitment Bank"). Each Additional Commitment Bank shall
enter into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Guarantor and
the Administrative Agent pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Bank
shall, effective as of the Existing Commitment Termination Date, have undertaken
a Commitment (which, if such Additional Commitment Bank is an Extending Bank,
shall be in addition to such Extending Bank's Commitment hereunder on such
date).

(d) If on the Determination Date (i) the sum of the total Commitments of
the Extending Banks and the total Commitments of the Additional Commitment Banks
is more than 50% of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the Existing
Commitment Termination Date and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, then, effective as of the Existing Commitment Termination
Date, the Commitment Termination Date shall be extended to the date 364 days
after the Consent Date (except that, if the date to which the Commitment

in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans; (iii) prepayments of Eurocurrency Rate

the Banks pursuant to Section 2.11; and (iv) each prepayment in respect of any
Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among such Loans.

Loans (after giving effect to all other repayments of any of such Loans on such
date) exceeds the Total Commitment as then in effect, the Borrowers shall prepay
principal of the Loans in an amount equal to such excess; provided that any such
prepayment shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans outstanding and second to
Eurocurrency Rate Loans outstanding.

(d) With respect to each prepayment of Loans required by this Section
5.02, the Borrowers may, subject to Section 2.01(c), designate the specific
Borrowing or Borrowings to which the prepayment shall be applied; provided that
each prepayment of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro
rata among the Loans in such Borrowing. In the absence of a designation by the
Borrowers as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent
shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its sole discretion.

5.03 Method and Place of Payment. Except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all payments under this Agreement or any Note shall be made to
the Administrative Agent for account of the Bank or Banks entitled thereto not
later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date when due and shall be made

<PAGE>

thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect
to payments of principal, interest shall be payable at the applicable rate
during such extension.

5.04 Net Payments. (a) All payments made by the Borrowers hereunder or
under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. All
such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any
jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein (but excluding, except as provided below, any tax imposed on or measured
by the net income of a Bank pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction (or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) in which the
principal office or Applicable Lending Office of such Bank is located ("Excluded
Taxes") and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto
(collectively, "Taxes"). The Borrowers shall reimburse each Bank, upon the
written request of such Bank, for Excluded Taxes in respect of amounts paid to
or on behalf of such Bank pursuant to the preceding sentence. If any Taxes are
so levied or imposed, the Borrowers agree to pay the full amount of such Taxes
and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all
amounts due hereunder or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or
on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or
in such Note. The Borrowers will furnish to the Administrative Agent within 45
days after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrowers. The
Borrowers will indemnify and hold harmless each Bank, and reimburse such Bank
upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and
paid by such Bank.

(b) Each Bank shall designate an Applicable Lending Office that, on the
date of this Agreement or (in the case of any Person that becomes a Bank
hereunder by means of an assignment) on the date that such Bank becomes a party
hereto, is entitled to a zero rate of (i) United States withholding tax on all
payments made hereunder by OFI and (ii) United Kingdom withholding tax on all
payments made hereunder by OFL. On the date of this Agreement, each Bank
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States has
provided OFI with the forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service of the
United States (currently Form 4224 or Form 1001) certifying such Bank's
exemption from United States withholding taxes with respect to all payments to
be made to such Bank hereunder and under the Notes as at the date of such
certificate. Within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, each Bank
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom shall
request, and shall provide to OFL as soon as received, the notice issued by the
Department of Inland Revenue of the United Kingdom (currently Form 242/FD)
certifying such Bank's exemption from United Kingdom withholding taxes with
respect to all payments to be made to such Bank hereunder and under the Notes as
at the date of such certificate. Each Bank shall provide such forms (or
appropriate replacement forms) on an updated basis from time to time if
requested by OFI in the case of United States forms and by OFL in the case of
United Kingdom forms. Unless the Borrowers have received forms or other
documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder or under any
Note are not subject to withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate
reduced by an applicable tax treaty, (a) OFI shall withhold taxes from such
payments at the applicable


21
<PAGE>

statutory rate in the case of payments to or for any Bank organized under the
laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, and (b) OFL shall withhold
taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate in the case of
payments to or for any Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
the United Kingdom. If any Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States fails to provide OFI, or if any Bank organized under
the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United Kingdom fails to provide OFL,
with the prescribed forms referred to in the second, third and fourth sentences
of this Section 5.04(b), and notwithstanding Section 12.15 hereof, the Borrowers
shall not be required to compensate such Bank under Section 5.04(a) for the
amount of taxes withheld pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence;
provided that this sentence shall be inapplicable to any Bank that is not able
to make the certification set forth in such prescribed forms as a result of a
change in United States federal, or United Kingdom, income tax law, regulation
or interpretation occurring after the date of this Agreement, or to an
amendment, modification or revocation of an applicable tax treaty or a change in
official position regarding the application or interpretation thereof, in each
case, occurring after the date hereof.

the Banks to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans, each Borrower (but
only OFI with respect to Section 7.09) makes the following representations,
warranties and agreements as to itself as of the date of this Agreement, which
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the
making of the Loans.

7.01 Corporate Status. Each of the Borrowers and its Subsidiaries (i) is a
duly organized and validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of


24
<PAGE>

its incorporation, (ii) has the power and authority to own its property and
assets and to transact the business in which it is engaged and (iii) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified could not have a material adverse effect on the business, operations,
property, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or (to the knowledge of
such Borrower) prospects of such Borrower or of such Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

7.02 Corporate Power and Authority. Each Borrower has the corporate power
to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of each of the Credit
Documents to which it is party and has taken all necessary corporate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of each of such Credit
Documents. Such Borrower has duly executed and delivered each of the Credit
Documents to which it is party, and each of such Credit Documents constitutes
its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms
except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether the issue
of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

7.03 No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or performance by
either Borrower of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, nor compliance
by it with the terms and provisions thereof, (i) will contravene any provision
of any law, statute, rule or regulation or any order, writ, injunction or decree
of any court or governmental instrumentality, (ii) will conflict or be
inconsistent with or result in any breach of any of the terms, covenants,
conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the
creation or any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, credit agreement, loan
agreement or any other agreement, contract or instrument to which such Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its property or
assets is bound or to which it may be subject or (iii) will violate any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws or other comparable
corporate charter documents of such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

7.04 Governmental Approvals. No order, consent, approval, license,
authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with
(except as have been obtained or made prior to the date hereof), or exemption
by, any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, is
required to authorize, or is required in connection with, (i) the execution,
delivery and performance of any Credit Document to which each Borrower is a
party or (ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
such Credit Document.

7.05 Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to
the best knowledge of either Borrower threatened (i) with respect to any Credit
Document or (ii) that are reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect
the business, operations, property, assets, condition (financial or otherwise)
or (to the knowledge of such Borrower) prospects of such Borrower or of such
Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.


25
<PAGE>

7.06 True and Complete Disclosure. All factual information (taken as a
whole) heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of each
Borrower in writing to any Bank (including, without limitation, all information
contained in the Credit Documents) for purposes of or in connection with this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein is, and all other such factual
information (taken as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf of such
Borrower in writing to any Bank will be, true and accurate in all material
respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified and does
not or will not omit to state any fact necessary to make such information (taken
as a whole) not misleading in any material respect at such time in light of the
circumstances under which such information was provided.

7.07 Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. All proceeds of each Loan shall
be used by each Borrower for general corporate purposes, including the repayment
of maturing Commercial Paper of such Borrower and acquisitions. No part of the
proceeds of any Loan will be used by such Borrower to purchase or carry any
Margin Stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any Margin Stock in violation of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. Not more than 25% of the value of the
assets of such Borrower or such Borrower and its Subsidiaries subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 9 of this Agreement constitute Margin Stock
and, at the time of each Borrowing, not more than 25% of the value of the assets
of such Borrower or such Borrower and its Subsidiaries subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 9 of this Agreement will constitute Margin
Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.07, each
Borrower will not use the proceeds of any Loan to purchase the capital stock of
any corporation in a transaction, or as part of a series of transactions, (i)
the purpose of which is, at the time of any such purchase, to acquire control of
such corporation or (ii) the result of which is the ownership by the Guarantor
and its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, such Borrower) of 10% or
more of the capital stock of such corporation, in either case if the Board of
Directors of such corporation has publicly announced its opposition to such
transaction.

7.08 Tax Returns and Payments. Each of the Borrowers and its Subsidiaries
has filed all tax returns required to be filed (taking into account all valid
extensions) by it and has paid all income taxes payable by it which have become
due pursuant to such tax returns and all other taxes and assessments payable by
it which have become due, other than those not yet delinquent and except for
those contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been
established. Each Borrower and its Subsidiaries has paid, or has provided
adequate reserves (in the good faith judgment of the management of the Borrower)
for the payment of, all Federal and state income taxes or income tax imposed by
any other relevant jurisdiction applicable for all prior fiscal years and for
the current fiscal year to the end of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding
the date hereof.

7.09 Compliance with ERISA. Each Plan is in substantial compliance with
ERISA; no Plan is insolvent or in reorganization, no Plan has an Unfunded
Current Liability, and no Plan has an accumulated or waived funding deficiency
or permitted decreases in its funding standard account within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code; neither OFI or any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate of OFI
has incurred any material liability to or on account of a Plan pursuant


26
<PAGE>

to Section 515, 4062, 4063, 4064, 4201 or 4204 of ERISA or expects to incur any
liability under any of the foregoing sections on account of the termination of
participation in or contributions to any such Plan; no proceedings have been
instituted to terminate any Plan; no condition exists which presents a material
risk to OFI or any of its Subsidiaries of incurring a liability to or on account
of a Plan pursuant to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code; no Lien
imposed under the Code or ERISA on the assets of OFI or any of its Subsidiaries
exists or is likely to arise on account of any Plan; and OFI and its
Subsidiaries may terminate contributions to any other employee benefit plans
maintained by them without incurring any material liability to any Person
interested therein.

7.10 Subsidiaries. As of March 29, 1999, the corporations listed on
Schedule III are the only Subsidiaries of the Borrowers. Schedule III correctly
sets forth, as of March 29, 1999, the percentage ownership (direct and indirect)
of the Borrowers in each class of capital stock of each of its Subsidiaries and
also identifies the direct owner thereof.

7.11 Compliance with Statutes, etc. Each of the Borrowers and its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable statutes, regulations and
orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by, all governmental bodies,
domestic or foreign in respect of the conduct of its business and the ownership
of its property (including applicable statutes, regulations, orders and
restrictions relating to environmental standards and controls), except such
noncompliances as would not, if the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
the business, operations, property, assets, condition (financial or otherwise)
or (to the knowledge of such Borrower) prospects of such Borrower or of such
Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

7.12 Investment Company Act. Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
is an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.

7.13 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," or an "affiliate," of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.

7.14 [Intentionally Omitted]

7.15 Year 2000 Issues. The Borrowers have reviewed the mission critical
systems in the operations of the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries with a view to
assessing the potential impact of the Year 2000 Problem on the businesses of the
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries. Based on such review and on actions being taken
as part of the Guarantor's Year 2000 program, the Borrowers have no reason to
believe that a material adverse effect on the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole will result from a Year 2000 Problem. For purposes of this
Section, "Year 2000 Problem" means any significant risk that computer hardware
or software used in the business or operations of the Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries will not, in the case of dates or time periods occurring after
December 31, 1999, function at least as effectively as in the case of dates or
time periods occurring prior to January 1, 2000.


27

prevent (i) the withdrawal by such Borrower or any of its


28
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries of its qualification as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction
where such withdrawal could not have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, property, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or (to the
knowledge of such Borrower) prospects of such Borrower or such Subsidiary or
(ii) any merger involving such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent
permitted by Section 7(j) of the Guaranty.

8.04 Compliance with Statutes, etc. Each Borrower will, and will cause

such action, if any, which OFI, such Subsidiary or such ERISA Affiliate is

Section 11. The Administrative Agent; Agents.

11.01 Appointment. The Banks hereby designate Citibank as Administrative
Agent, to act as specified herein and in the other Credit Documents. Each Bank
hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of any Note by the acceptance of
such Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Administrative Agent to
take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement, the other
Credit Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein or
therein and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and
thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative
Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties
hereunder by or through its officers, directors, agents or employees.

11.02 Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall have no duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Guaranty. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by it or
them hereunder or under any other Credit Document or in connection herewith or
therewith, unless caused by its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in
nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or
any other Credit Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Bank or the
holder of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon
the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document except as expressly set forth herein.

11.03 Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. Independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Bank and the holder of each
Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to make
its own independent investigation and


34
<PAGE>

appraisal of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrowers and the
Guarantor in connection with the making and the continuance of the Loans and the
taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith and, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have no
duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide
any Bank or the holder of any Note with any credit or other information with
respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the
Loans or at any time or times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible to any Bank or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements,
information, representations or warranties herein or in any document,
certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for the
execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection,
collectibility, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or the financial condition of the Borrowers or the Guarantor or be
required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of
any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, or the financial condition of the Borrowers or the Guarantor or the
existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default.

11.04 Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative
Agent shall request instructions from the Required Banks with respect to any act
or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any
other Credit Document, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to refrain
from such act or taking such action unless and until the Administrative Agent
shall have received instructions from the Required Banks; and the Administrative
Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.
Without limiting the foregoing, no Bank or the holder of any Note shall have any
right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the
Administrative Agent's acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any
other Credit Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required Banks.

11.05 Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice,
statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram,
radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent or made by
any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be the proper Person, and,
with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and any other
Credit Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice of counsel
selected by it.

11.06 Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed by the Borrowers, the Banks will reimburse the Administrative Agent
on demand, in proportion to their respective percentages used in determining the
Required Banks at such time, for and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) or
disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted
against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties
hereunder or under any other Credit Document, or in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that no
Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting


35
<PAGE>

from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
obligations of the Banks under this Section 11.06 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

11.07 The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. The
Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with the Borrowers or any
Affiliate of the Borrowers as if it were not performing the duties specified
herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrowers for
services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to
account for the same to the Banks.

11.08 Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of
any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written
notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case may be,
shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request, authority or
consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding
on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or indorsee, as the case may be,
of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

11.09 Resignation By the Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative
Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions and duties hereunder
and/or under the other Credit Documents at any time by giving 15 Business Days'
prior written notice to the Borrowers and the Banks. Such resignation shall take
effect upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to
clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided below.

(b) Upon any such notice of resignation, the Banks shall appoint a
successor Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a commercial
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers.

(c) If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so appointed
within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the consent
of the Borrowers, may then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who shall
serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if any,
as the Banks appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

(d) If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant to
clause (b) or (c) above by the 20th Business Day after the date such notice of
resignation was given by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent's
resignation shall become effective and the Banks shall thereafter perform all
the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and/or under any other Credit
Document until such time, if any, as the Banks appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided above.

11.10 The Documentation Agent and the Syndication Agent. The Documentation
Agent and the Syndication Agent so named in this Agreement shall have no rights
or obligations under this Agreement in their respective capacities as the
Documentation Agent and the Syndication Agent.

Banks, replace the Bank which is acting in the capacity of Administrative Agent,
but solely with respect to such capacity.

the transactions herein contemplated are consummated, pay all reasonable

affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives

arising out of, or in any way related to, or by reason of, any investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (whether or not the Administrative Agent or any
Bank is a party thereto) related to the entering into and/or performance of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document or the use or proposed use of the
proceeds of any Loans or the consummation of any transactions contemplated
herein or in any other Credit Document, including, without limitation, the fees
and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (but excluding any such liabilities, obligations,
losses, etc., to the extent incurred by reason of the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified).

12.02 Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Bank and the
Administrative Agent (each, together with its affiliates, a "Relevant
Institution") is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to the Borrowers or to
any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and
to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other
indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Relevant Institution (including,
without limitation, by branches and agencies of such Relevant Institution
wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of a Borrower against and
on account of the Obligations and liabilities of such Borrower to such Relevant
Institution under this Agreement or under any of the other Credit Documents,
including, without limitation, all


37
<PAGE>

interests in Obligations purchased by such Relevant Institution (if a "Bank")
pursuant to Section 12.06(b), and all other claims of any nature or description
arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
irrespective of whether or not such Relevant Institution shall have made any
demand hereunder and although said Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of
them, shall be contingent or unmatured.

12.03 Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices
and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including
telegraphic, telex, telecopier or cable communication) and mailed, telegraphed,
telexed, telecopied, cabled or delivered: if to the Borrowers, at their
respective addresses specified opposite their signatures below; if to any Bank,
at its Base Rate Lending Office specified opposite its name on Schedule II; if
to the Administrative Agent, at its Notice Office; or, as to the Borrowers or
the Administrative Agent, at such other address as shall be designated by such
party in a written notice to the other parties hereto and, as to each other
party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written
notice to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent. All such notices and
communications shall, when mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, or cabled
or sent by overnight courier, be effective when deposited in the mails,
delivered to the telegraph company, cable company or overnight courier, as the
case may be, or sent by telex or telecopier, except that notices and
communications to the Administrative Agent and notices and communications sent
by mail to any party, shall not be effective until received.

12.04 Benefit of Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and
assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that the Borrowers may not
assign or transfer any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Banks; and provided, further, that,
although any Bank may transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights
hereunder and under the Notes, such Bank shall remain a "Bank" for all purposes
hereunder (and may not transfer or assign its Commitment hereunder except as
provided in Section 12.04(b)) and the transferee, assignee or participant, as
the case may be, shall not constitute a "Bank" hereunder; and provided, further,
that no Bank shall transfer, grant or assign any participation under which the
participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this
Agreement except to the extent such amendment or waiver requires the consent of
100% of the Banks, as provided in Section 12.13. In the case of any such
participation, the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or
any of the other Credit Documents (the participant's rights against such Bank in
respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by
such Bank in favor of the participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable
by the Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such
participation, except that the participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 5.04 of this Agreement to the extent that such Bank
would be entitled to such benefits if the participation had not been
transferred, granted or assigned. Promptly following the consummation of any
participation pursuant to this Section 12.04(a), the Bank entering into such
participation shall promptly notify the Borrowers thereof.


38
<PAGE>

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Bank may, with prior written
consent of the Guarantor (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
assign all, or if less than all, a portion equal to at least $5,000,000 in the
aggregate of its Commitment (and related outstanding principal amount of Loans)
hereunder to one or more commercial banks or other financial institutions
engaged in the business of lending money or acquiring debt securities; provided
that (i) at such time Schedule I hereto shall be deemed modified to reflect the
Commitments of such new Bank and of the existing Banks, (ii) upon surrender of
the old Notes, new Notes will be issued, at the expense of the Borrower that
issued the Note, to such new Bank and to the assigning Bank, such new Notes to
be in conformity with the requirements of Section 2.05 (with appropriate
modifications) to the extent needed to reflect the revised Commitments and (iii)
the Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from
the assigning or the assignee Bank, the payment of a non-refundable assignment
fee of $3,000. To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this Section
12.04(b), the assigning Bank shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with
respect to its assigned Commitments. To the extent that an assignment of all or
any portion of a Bank's Commitments and related outstanding Obligations pursuant
to this Section 12.04(b) would, at the time of such assignment, result in
increased costs under Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.04 greater than those being
charged by the respective assigning Bank prior to such assignment, then the
Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay such greater increased costs (although
the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type
described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective
assignments).

(c) [Intentionally Omitted]

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Bank
shall be entitled to pledge its Loans and/or Notes hereunder to a Federal
Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Bank from such Federal
Reserve Bank.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, subject to
the prior written consent of the Guarantor (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld), any Bank (a "Granting Bank"), may grant to a special purpose funding
vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the
Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent, the Guarantor and the Borrowers, the
option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Loan that such
Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment
by any SPC to make any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such
option or otherwise fails or is unable to provide all or any part of such Loan,
the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms
hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of
the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such
Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for
any indemnity or payment under this Agreement for which a Bank would otherwise
be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting Bank provides such
indemnity or makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Borrower
and the Guarantor hereby agree (which agreement shall survive the termination of
this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the


39

payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness
of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in
instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any
State thereof.

12.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of
the Administrative Agent or any Bank or the holder of any Note in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder under any other Credit Document and no
course of dealing between the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or any Bank or
the holder of any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any
other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The
rights, powers and remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies
which the Administrative Agent or any Bank or the holder of any Note would
otherwise have. No notice to or demand on the Borrowers in any case shall
entitle the Borrowers to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Administrative
Agent or any Bank or the holder of any Note to any other or further action in
any circumstances without notice or demand.

12.06 Payments Pro Rata. (a) The Administrative Agent agrees that promptly
after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of either Borrower in
respect of any Obligations of such Borrower hereunder, it shall distribute such
payment to the Banks pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the
Obligations with respect to which such payment was received.

(b) Each of the Banks agrees that, if it should receive any amount
hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the
exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or
otherwise), which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest
on, the Loans, Facility Fees or other Fees, of a sum which with respect to the
related sum or sums received by other Banks is in a greater proportion than the
total amount of such Obligation then owed and due to such Bank bears to the
total amount of such Obligation then owed and due to all of the Banks
immediately prior to such receipt, then such Bank receiving such excess payment
shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the other Banks an
interest in the Obligations of the Borrowers to such Banks in such amount as
shall result in a proportional participation by all the Banks in such amount;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess amount is
thereafter recovered from such Bank, such purchase shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest;
and provided, further, that a Bank's obligations pursuant to this Section
12.06(b) shall not be interpreted to apply to any portion of the Fee which is
payable to such Bank pursuant to Section 4.01(b) hereof and is not payable to
other Banks because of the Banks' differing Commitment levels.


40
<PAGE>

12.07 Calculations; Computations. All computations of interest and
Facility Fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days
(365/366 days in the case of interest on Base Rate Loans) for the actual number
of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which such interest or Facility Fees are payable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for each day that interest is calculated by reference to the Federal
Funds Rate, such interest shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days.

12.08 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue. (a) This Agreement
and the other Credit Documents and the rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder and thereunder shall be construed in accordance with and be governed
by the law of the State of New York. Any legal action or proceeding against the
Borrowers with respect to this Agreement or any other Credit Document may be
brought in the courts of the State of New York or of the United States for the
Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement,
each Borrower hereby irrevocably accepts for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts. Each Borrower agrees that if at any time its principal place of business
is not in the City and State of New York, it will irrevocably designate, appoint
and empower an agent for purposes of this Section, in the City and State of New
York, as its designee, appointee and agent to receive, accept and acknowledge
for and on its behalf, and in respect of its property, service of any and all
legal process, summons, notices and documents which may be served in any such
action or proceeding. If for any reason such designee, appointee and agent shall
cease to be available to act as such, each Borrower agrees to designate a new
designee, appointee and agent in New York City on the terms and for the purposes
of this provision satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Each Borrower
further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Borrower at
its address set forth opposite its signature below, such service to become
effective 30 days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of
the Administrative Agent, any Bank or the holder of any Note to serve process in
any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise
proceed against the Borrowers in any other jurisdiction.

(b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or
proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any other
Credit Document brought in the courts referred to in clause (a) above and hereby
further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum.

12.09 Payment Denominations. All payments of principal and interest on any
Loan and other amounts to be paid by any Borrower under this Agreement shall be
made in Dollars. The obligation of the Borrowers to make payment in Dollars of
the principal of and interest on the Notes and any other amounts due hereunder
or under any other Credit Document to the Payment Office of the Administrative
Agent as provided in Section 5.03 shall not be discharged or satisfied by any
tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment, which is


41
<PAGE>

expressed in or converted into any currency other than Dollars, except to the
extent such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt by the
Administrative Agent at its Payment Office on behalf of the Banks or holders of
the Notes of the full amount of Dollars expressed to be payable in respect of
the principal of and interest on the Notes and all other amounts due hereunder
or under any other Credit Document. The obligation of the Borrowers to make
payments in Dollars as aforesaid shall be enforceable as an alternative or
additional cause of action for the purpose of recovery in Dollars of the amount,
if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of
Dollars expressed to be payable in respect of the principal of and interest on
the Notes and any other amounts due under any other Credit Document, and shall
not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sums due under this
Agreement or under any other Credit Document.

12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each
of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument. A set of counterparts
executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent.

12.11 [Intentionally Omitted]

12.12 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several sections and
subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in
any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

12.13 Amendment or Waiver. None of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such change, waiver, discharge or termination is in writing
signed by the Required Banks; provided, however, that: no such change, waiver,
discharge or termination shall, without the consent of each Bank, (i) extend the
Commitment Termination Date (except as provided in Section 4.03) or the final
maturity of any Loan or Note or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
interest or Fees thereon, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase
the Commitment of any Bank (except as provided in Section 4.04) over the amount
thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or
Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not
constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment of any Bank) , (ii) release
the Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, (iii) amend, modify or
waive any provision of this Section 12.13 or Section 11.06, 12.01, 12.02, 12.04,
12.06 or 12.07, (iv) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Banks, or (v) consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrowers of
any of their rights and obligations under this Agreement.

12.14 Survival. All indemnities set forth herein, including, without
limitation, in Sections 2.10, 2.11, 5.04, 11.06 and 12.01, shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the making and
repayment of the Loans.

<PAGE>

12.15 Domicile of Loans. Subject to Section 5.04(b), but notwithstanding
Section 12.04 (b), each Bank may transfer and carry its Loans at, to or for the
account of any office, Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Bank; provided, that each
Bank will use its best efforts not to effect a transfer of its Loans to an
Applicable Lending Office which would give rise to the operation of Section
2.10(a) (ii) or (iii) or 2.10(c) unless in its sole discretion such Bank finds
that such nontransfer would be disadvantageous to it.

12.16 Limitation on Additional Amounts, etc. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Sections 2.10, 2.11 or 5.04 of this Agreement, (a) a
Bank shall not be entitled to payment of any amount under any such Section from
a Borrower unless such Bank is seeking payment from other borrowers similarly
situated in respect of the relevant increased costs, Taxes, losses, expenses or
liabilities, reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return
on capital, and (b) unless a Bank gives notice to the Borrowers that they are
obligated to pay an amount under any such Section within six months after the
later of (x) the date such Bank incurs the respective increased costs, Taxes,
loss, expense or liability, reduction in amounts received or receivable or
reduction in return on capital or (y) the date such Bank has actual knowledge of
its incurrence of the respective increased costs, Taxes, loss, expense or
liability, reductions in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return
on capital, then such Bank shall only be entitled to be compensated for such
amount by the Borrowers pursuant to said Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.04, as the case
may be, to the extent the costs, Taxes, loss, expense or liability, reduction in
amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital are incurred or
suffered on or after the date which occurs six months prior to such Bank's
notice to the Borrowers that it is obligated to pay the respective amounts
pursuant to said Section 2.10, 2.11 or 5.04, as the case may be. This Section
12.16 shall have no applicability to any Section of this Agreement other than
said Sections 2.10, 2.11 and 5.04.

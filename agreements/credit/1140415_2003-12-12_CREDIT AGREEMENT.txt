interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by the Swing Line Bank
until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal
Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for
the account of the Swing Line Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in
respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender

Page 29

<PAGE>

on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding
principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by the Swing Line Bank shall be
reduced by such amount on such Business Day. Since the Swing Line Borrowings
will be made on a daily automated basis without review by the Administrative
Agent or the Swing Line Bank of the satisfaction of conditions precedent to
Swing Line Borrowings set forth herein, some Swing Line Borrowings may be made
without satisfaction of such conditions precedent (including without limitation
the condition precedent that no Default shall have occurred), but the Revolving
Credit Lenders shall nevertheless remain obligated to purchase their respective
Pro Rata Share of such Swing Line Borrowings as provided for herein. Nothing set
forth herein shall excuse the U.S. Borrower from its obligation to satisfy such
conditions. The Swing Line Bank agrees (with the concurrence of U.S. Borrower)
that it shall not make any Swing Line Advance after receipt of written notice
from the Administrative Agent that a Default or an Event of Default shall have
occurred which is continuing or that U.S. Borrower shall have otherwise failed
to satisfy all of the conditions precedent to further Swing Line Borrowings
hereunder. (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Applicable Borrower may not select Euro Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate
Advances for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less
than U.S.$5,000,000 (or the Equivalent in Euros at such time) or Eurodollar Rate
Advances if the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.09 or Section 2.10;
provided, however, that if the syndication under this Agreement has not been
completed on or prior to the Effective Date then the Applicable Borrower may
only select Euro Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances with 7-day Interest
Period until the earlier of (i) the date which is one month after the Effective
Date and (ii) the date the syndication has been completed as shall be specified
by the Joint Lead Arrangers in a notice to the Borrowers. In addition, the
Tranche A U.S. Term Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than three
separate Borrowings, the Tranche A Euro Term Advances may not be outstanding as
part of more than three separate Borrowings, the Tranche B Term Advances may not
be outstanding as part of more than six separate Borrowings and the Revolving
Credit Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than six separate
Borrowings. 51 46 (d) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding
on the Applicable Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice
of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Euro Rate Advances or Eurodollar
Rate Advances, the Applicable Borrower shall indemnify each Appropriate Lender
against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any
failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing
for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III,
including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of anticipated profits),
cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made
by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date. (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall
have received notice from an Appropriate Lender prior to the date of any
Borrowing under a Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment that such
Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable
portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender
has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such
Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the Applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the
extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to
the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Applicable Borrower severally
agree to repay or pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount and to pay interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to the Applicable Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid or paid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the
Applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable at such time under Section
2.07 to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender,
(A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B)
the cost of funds incurred by the Administrative Agent in respect of such amount

Page 30

<PAGE>

in the case of Advances denominated in Euros. If such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall
constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for all purposes. (f)
The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any
Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any,
hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be
made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. SECTION 2.03. Issuance
of and Drawings and Reimbursement Under Letters of Credit. (a) Request for
Issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued upon notice, given not later
than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the tenth Business Day prior to the date
of the proposed issuance of such Letter of Credit, by the U.S. Borrower to the
Issuing Bank, which shall give to the Administrative Agent and each Revolving
Credit Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier. Each such notice of
issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "NOTICE OF 52 47 ISSUANCE") shall be by
telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or telecopier, specifying
therein the requested (A) date of such issuance (which shall be a Business Day),
(B) Available Amount of such Letter of Credit, (C) expiration date of such
Letter of Credit and whether such Letter of Credit is a Trade Letter of Credit,
(D) name and address of the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and (E) form of
such Letter of Credit, and shall be accompanied by such application and
agreement for letter of credit as the Issuing Bank may specify to the U.S.
Borrower for use in connection with such requested Letter of Credit (a "LETTER
OF CREDIT AGREEMENT"). If (x) the requested form of such Letter of Credit is
acceptable to the Issuing Bank in its sole discretion and (y) the Issuing Bank
has not received notice of objection asserting that the conditions contained in
Section 3.02 have not been satisfied to such issuance from Lenders holding at
least a majority of the Revolving Credit Commitments and (z) issuance of the
requested Letter of Credit is within the limits of Section 2.01(f), the Issuing
Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article
III, make such Letter of Credit available to the U.S. Borrower at its office
referred to in Section 8.02 or as otherwise agreed with the U.S. Borrower in
connection with such issuance. In the event and to the extent that the
provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with this Agreement,
the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. (b) Letter of Credit Reports. The
Issuing Bank shall furnish (A) to the Administrative Agent on the first Business
Day of each week a written report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of
Letters of Credit issued during the previous week and drawings during such week
under all Letters of Credit, (B) to each Revolving Credit Lender on the first
Business Day of each month a written report summarizing issuance and expiration
dates of Letters of Credit issued during the preceding month and drawings during
such month under all Letters of Credit and (C) to the Administrative Agent and
each Revolving Credit Lender on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter
a written report setting forth the average daily aggregate Available Amount
during the preceding calendar quarter of all Letters of Credit. (c) Drawing and
Reimbursement. The payment by the Issuing Bank of a draft drawn under any Letter
of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement the making by the
Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit Advance, which shall be a Base Rate Advance,
in the amount of such draft. Upon written demand by the Issuing Bank, with a
copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent, each Revolving Credit Lender
shall purchase from the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank shall sell and assign
to each such Revolving Credit Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
outstanding Letter of Credit Advance as of the date of such purchase, by making
available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, by deposit to the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the
outstanding principal amount of such Letter of Credit Advance to be purchased by
such Revolving Credit Lender. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative
Agent shall transfer such funds to the Issuing Bank. The U.S. Borrower hereby
agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees to
purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Letter of Credit Advance on (i)
the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by the Issuing Bank, provided
that notice of such 53 48 demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York

Page 31

<PAGE>

City time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding
such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon any such
assignment by the Issuing Bank to any Revolving Credit Lender of a portion of a
Letter of Credit Advance, the Issuing Bank represents and warrants to such other
Lender that the Issuing Bank is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest
being assigned by it, free and clear of any liens, but makes no other
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such
Letter of Credit Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the
extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of
such Letter of Credit Advance available to the Administrative Agent, such
Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of
demand by the Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account
of the Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent such amount for the account of the Issuing Bank on any
Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a
Letter of Credit Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes
of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Letter of Credit
Advance made by the Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such
Business Day. (d) Failure to Make Letter of Credit Advances. The failure of any
Lender to make the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on the date
specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation hereunder to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Letter of Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date. SECTION

Borrower might have or might acquire as a result of the payment by the Issuing
Bank of any draft or the reimbursement by the U.S. Borrower thereof): (A) any
lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document, any Letter of Credit

U.S.$5,000,000 (or the Equivalent in Euros at such time) or an integral multiple
of U.S.$1,000,000 (or the Equivalent in Euros at such time) in excess thereof
and (ii) shall be made ratably among the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with
their Commitments with respect to such Facility. (b) Mandatory. (i) On the date

aggregate Tranche A U.S. Term Commitments of the Tranche A U.S. Term Lenders
shall be automatically and permanently reduced, on a pro rata basis, by an
amount equal to the amount by which the aggregate Tranche A U.S. Term
Commitments immediately prior to such reduction exceed the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Tranche A U.S. Term Advances then outstanding. (ii) On
the date of each repayment or prepayment of the Tranche A Euro Term Advances,
the aggregate Tranche A Euro Term Commitments of the Tranche A Euro Term Lenders

permanently reduced from time to time on the date of each reduction in the
Revolving Credit Facility by the amount, if any, by which the amount of the
Swing Line Facility exceeds the Revolving Credit Facility after giving effect to
such reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility. 59 54 (v) The Revolving Credit
Facility shall be automatically and permanently reduced, on each date on which
prepayment thereof is required to be made pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(i) or (ii)
in an amount equal to the applicable Reduction Amount, provided that each such
reduction of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be made ratably among the
Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments.
(vi) The Letter of Credit Facility shall be permanently reduced from time to

Credit Facility. SECTION 2.06. Prepayments. (a) Optional. The Applicable
Borrower may, upon at least one Business Day's notice in the case of Base Rate
Advances and three Business Days' notice in the case of Euro Rate Advances or
Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case to the Administrative Agent stating the
proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such
notice is given the Applicable Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding aggregate

Page 34

<PAGE>

principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole
or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the aggregate principal amount prepaid at any time and from time
to time, without premium or penalty; provided, however, that (x) each partial
prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of U.S.$3,000,000 (or the
Equivalent in Euros at such time) or an integral multiple of U.S.$1,000,000 (or
the Equivalent in Euros at such time) in excess thereof and (y) if any
prepayment of a Euro Rate Advance or a Eurodollar Rate Advance is made on a date
other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Advance, the Applicable
Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 9.04(c). Each such
prepayment shall be applied, at the option of the U.S. Borrower either (i) to
the next four installments in order of maturity of the Tranche A U.S. Term
Facility, the Tranche A Euro Term Facility and the Tranche B Term Facility and
to such installments on a pro rata basis, subject to Section 2.06(c), or (ii) to
the Revolving Credit Facility or (iii) to the Swing Line Advances or (iv) to the
Letter of Credit Advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prepayment of Swing

(b) Mandatory. (i) The Applicable Borrower shall, on the 90th day following the
end of each Fiscal Year, beginning with Fiscal Year 2002, prepay an aggregate
principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowings and
deposit an amount in the L/C Cash Collateral Account in an amount equal to (A)
if the Total Debt/EBITDA Ratio at such time is greater than 4.00:1.00, 75% of
Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year, or (B) if the Total Debt/EBITDA Ratio at
such time is less than or equal to 4.00:1.00 but greater than 2.50:1.00, 50% of
Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year. No such prepayment shall be required if
the Total Debt/EBITDA Ratio is equal to or less than 2.50:1.00. Each such
prepayment shall be applied first to the next four installments in order of
maturity of the Tranche A U.S. Term Facility, the Tranche A Euro Term Facility
and the Tranche B Term Facility and to such 60 55 installments on a pro rata
basis, subject to Section 2.06(c), and second to the Revolving Credit Facility

assets of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any sale, lease,
transfer or other disposition of (i) Inventory, Equipment or other operating
assets in the ordinary course of business and not as a part of the sale of a
business, and (ii) other assets for Net Cash Proceeds, in the aggregate, not to
exceed U.S.$1,000,000, in any Fiscal Year), (B) the incurrence or issuance by

Interests by the U.S. Borrower to the Parent or by any Subsidiary of the U.S.
Borrower to the U.S. Borrower or another Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower, (iii)
50% of any Net Cash Proceeds from any issuance of Equity Interests of the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a bona fide underwritten initial public
offering if the Total Debt/EBITDA Ratio at such time is equal to or greater than
2.00:1.00 (calculated after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of
such issuance), (iv) 100% of any Net Cash Proceeds from any issuance of Equity
Interests of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a bona fide
underwritten initial public offering if the Total Debt/EBITDA Ratio at such time
is less than 2.00:1.00 (calculated after giving effect to the application of the
proceeds of such issuance), and (v) any issuance of Equity Interests of the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries solely to finance a Permitted Acquisition or
the Pending Acquisition) and (D) any Extraordinary Receipt received by or paid
to or for the account of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and not otherwise
included in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, prepay an aggregate principal amount
of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowings and deposit an amount in
the L/C Cash Collateral Account, as applicable, in an amount equal to the amount
of such Net Cash Proceeds. Each such prepayment shall be applied first ratably
to the Tranche A U.S. Term Facility, the Tranche A Euro Term Facility and the

Page 35

<PAGE>

Tranche B Term Facility and to the installments thereof on a pro rata basis,
subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(c), and second to the Revolving Credit
Facility as set forth in clause (v) hereof. (iii) The U.S. Borrower shall, on
each Business Day, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit
Advances comprising part of the same Borrowings, the Letter of Credit Advances
and the Swing Line Advances and deposit an amount in the L/C Cash Collateral
Account in an amount equal to the amount by which (A) the sum of the aggregate
principal amount of (x) the Revolving Credit Advances, (y) the Swing Line
Advances and (z) the Letter of Credit Advances then outstanding plus the
aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding exceeds (B)
the Revolving Credit Facility on such Business Day. (iv) The U.S. Borrower
shall, on each Business Day, pay to the Administrative Agent for deposit in the
L/C Cash Collateral Account an amount sufficient to cause the aggregate 61 56
amount on deposit in the L/C Cash Collateral Account to equal the amount by
which the aggregate Available Amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding
exceeds the Letter of Credit Facility on such Business Day. (v) Prepayments of
the Revolving Credit Facility made pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above
shall be first applied to prepay Letter of Credit Advances then outstanding
until such Advances are paid in full, second applied to prepay Revolving Credit
Advances then outstanding comprising part of the same Borrowings until such
Advances are paid in full and third deposited in the L/C Cash Collateral Account
to cash collateralize 100% of the Available Amount of the Letters of Credit then
outstanding; and, in the case of prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility
required pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, the amount remaining (if any)
after the prepayment in full of the Advances then outstanding and the 100% cash
collateralization of the aggregate Available Amount of Letters of Credit then
outstanding (the sum of such prepayment amounts, cash collateralization amounts
and remaining amount being referred to herein as the "REDUCTION AMOUNT") may, if
not used as set forth above, be retained by the U.S. Borrower and the Revolving
Credit Facility shall be permanently reduced as set forth in Section 2.05(b)(v).
Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit in the
L/C Cash Collateral Account, such funds shall be applied to reimburse the
Issuing Bank or the Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable. (vi) All
prepayments under this subsection (b) shall be made together with accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. (c)
Tranche B Opt Out. With respect to any prepayment of Tranche A U.S. Term
Advances, Tranche A Euro Term Advances or Tranche B Term Advances, the
Administrative Agent shall ratably pay the Tranche A U.S. Term Lenders, the
Tranche A Euro Term Lenders and Tranche B Term Lenders; provided, however, that
any Tranche B Lender, at its option, to the extent that any Tranche A U.S. Term
Advances or Tranche A Euro Term Advances are then outstanding, may elect not to
accept such prepayment. Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of any such
prepayment, the amount of the prepayment that is available to prepay the Tranche
B Term Advances shall be deposited in a cash collateral account on terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (the
"PREPAYMENT AMOUNT"), pending application of such amount on the Prepayment Date
as set forth below and promptly after such receipt (the date of such receipt
being the "RECEIPT DATE"), the Administrative Agent shall give written notice to
the Tranche B Term Lenders of the amount available to prepay the Term B Advances
and the date on which such prepayment shall be made (the "PREPAYMENT DATE"),
which date shall be 10 days after the Receipt Date. Any Lender declining such
prepayment (a "DECLINING LENDER") shall given written notice to the
Administrative Agent by 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Prepayment Date. On the Prepayment Date, an amount
equal to that portion of the Prepayment Amount accepted by the Tranche B Term
Lenders other than the Declining Lenders (such Lenders being the "ACCEPTING
LENDERS") to prepay Tranche B Term Advances owing to such Accepting Lenders
shall be withdrawn from the cash collateral account and applied to 62 57 prepay
Tranche B Term Advances owing to such Accepting Lenders on a pro rata basis. Any
amounts that would otherwise have been applied to prepay Advances under the
Tranche B Term Facility owing to Declining Lenders shall instead be applied
ratably to prepay the remaining Tranche A U.S. Term Advances and Tranche A Euro
Term Advances as provided in Section 2.06(a) and (b)(i). SECTION 2.07. Interest.

of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(a), a notice of Conversion pursuant to
Section 2.09 or a notice of selection of an Interest Period pursuant to the

period; provided, however, that any commitment fee accrued with respect to any
of the Commitments of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time
such Lender became a Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall not be
payable by the Applicable Borrower so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting
Lender except to the extent that such commitment fee shall otherwise have been
due and payable by such Applicable Borrower prior to such time; and provided
further that no commitment fee shall accrue on any of the Commitments of a

commissions, fronting fees, transfer fees and other fees and charges in
connection with the 64 59 issuance or administration of each Letter of Credit as
the U.S. Borrower and the Issuing Bank shall agree. SECTION 2.09. Conversion of
Advances. (a) Optional. The U.S. Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice
given to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time)
on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion and
subject to the provisions of Section 2.10, Convert all or any portion of the
Advances of one Type comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of the other
Type; provided, however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into
Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for
such Eurodollar Rate Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount
specified in Section 2.02(c), no Conversion of any Advances shall result in more
separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(c) and each Conversion of

be Converted and (iii) if such Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the
duration of the initial Interest Period for such Advances. Each notice of
Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the U.S. Borrower. (b) Mandatory.
(i) If the Applicable Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest
Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances or Euro Rate Advances, as the case may
be, in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest
Period" in Section 1.01, the Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the
Applicable Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders, whereupon each such Eurodollar
Rate Advance or Euro Rate Advance, as the case may be, will automatically, on
the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, be continued as a
Eurodollar Rate Advance or Euro Rate Advance, as the case may be, for a
one-month Interest Period. (ii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default, (x) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on
the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base
Rate Advance and (y) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended. SECTION 2.10.
Increased Costs, Etc. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any
change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date
hereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request issued or made after
the date hereof by any central bank or other governmental authority, including,
without limitation, any agency of the European Union or similar monetary or
multinational authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be
any increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make or of making,
funding or maintaining Euro Rate Advances or Eurodollar Rate Advances or of
agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or participating in Letters of
Credit or of agreeing to make or of making or maintaining Letter of Credit
Advances (excluding, for purposes of this Section 2.10, any such increased costs
resulting from or representing (x) Taxes or Other Taxes 65 60 (as to which
Section 2.12 shall govern) and (y) Excluded Taxes), then the Applicable Borrower
shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such

Page 38

<PAGE>

demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender Party additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender Party for such increased cost; provided, however, that a Lender Party
claiming additional amounts under this Section 2.10(a) agrees to use reasonable
efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if the making
of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable
judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender
Party. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the
Applicable Borrower by such Lender Party, shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If, due to either (i) the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the
date hereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request issued or made
after the date hereof by any central bank or other governmental authority,
including, without limitation, any agency of the European Union or similar
monetary or multinational authority (whether or not having the force of law),
there shall be any increase in the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Lender Party or any corporation controlling such Lender Party
as a result of or based upon the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to
lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder and other
commitments of such type or the issuance or maintenance of or participation in
the Letters of Credit (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand by
such Lender Party or such corporation (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender Party, from time to time as specified by
such Lender Party, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party
in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender Party
reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence
of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters
of Credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of or participation in any
Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Applicable
Borrower by such Lender Party shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error. (c) (i) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances
under any Facility, the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent in
writing, that the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their
Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period (setting forth in the writing
the nature and amount of such costs), the Administrative Agent shall forthwith
so notify the U.S. Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders, whereupon, unless the
U.S. Borrower offers to pay such increased costs to such Lenders, (x) each such
Eurodollar Rate Advance under such Facility will automatically, on the last day
of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance
and (y) the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert
Advances into such Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent 66 61 shall notify the U.S. Borrower that such Lenders have
determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist. (ii)
If, with respect to any Euro Rate Advances under the Tranche A Euro Term
Facility, Tranche A Euro Term Lenders holding at least a majority of the Tranche
A Euro Term Commitments notify in writing, the Administrative Agent that the
Euro Rate for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect
the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Euro Rate
Advances for such Interest Period (setting forth in the writing the nature and
amount of such costs), the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the
Euro Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders, whereupon, unless the Euro Borrower
offers to pay such increased costs to such Lenders, the applicable Euro Rate
shall be determined by the Administrative Agent on the basis set forth in the
proviso to the definition of Euro Rate. (d) (i) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central
bank or other governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any
Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to
make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate

Page 39

<PAGE>

Advances hereunder, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender
to the U.S. Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (x) each Eurodollar Rate
Advance under each Facility under which such Lender has a Commitment will
automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (y) the
obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall
notify the U.S. Borrower that such Lender has determined that the circumstances
causing such suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that, before making
any such demand, such Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a
different Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a designation would
allow such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to perform its
obligations to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be
otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. (ii) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central
bank or other governmental authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any
Tranche A Euro Term Lender or its Euro Lending Office to perform its obligations
hereunder to make Euro Rate Advances

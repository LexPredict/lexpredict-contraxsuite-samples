We are pleased to inform you that China Construction Bank Corporation, Singapore Branch (the “Bank”) has agreed to offer the above mentioned Facility (the “Facility”) to Hoku Corporation. (the “Borrower” or “you”).





Facility Type


Standard term loan facility.





Loan Tenor


Three years from the date of this Letter of Offer provided that the maturity date shall not be later than fourteen (14) days prior to the expiry date of the Standby Letter of Credit (“SBLC”) to be issued by CCB Sichuan Branch in support of the Facility (the “SBLC Issuer”).







Term Loan Amount


Up to United States Dollars (“USD”) Twenty Nine Million only (USD29,000,000), but subject to a maximum aggregate amount equal to 97% of the face value of the SBLC.















1























Applicable Interest Margin


2.00% per annum (the “Margin”)







Interest Rate


USD LIBOR plus applicable Margin. If in the event USD LIBOR is not published for a requested twelve month interest period, the USD LIBOR rate for such twelve-month period shall be determined by the Bank.







"USD LIBOR" means, in relation to a Drawing or the Loan;









(a)

(b)

"Screen Rate" means the British Bankers Association Settlement Rate for USD for the relevant interest period displayed on the appropriate page of the Reuters screen (current Reuters – LIBOR 01). If the agreed page is replaced or service ceases to be available, the Bank may specify another page or service displaying the appropriate rate after consultation with the Borrower.







Rate Fixing


USD LIBOR rate to be fixed two days prior to a Drawdown Date for a new Drawing or the date of a new interest period for an existing Drawing, as applicable (the "Rate Fixing Date").







Interest


Each interest period (the “Interest Period”) in respect of each Drawing shall be of three (3), six (6) months or twelve (12) months duration as selected by the Borrower.  The initial Interest Period shall commence on the Drawdown Date for each Drawing and shall expire on the date falling three (3), six (6) or twelve (12) months thereafter (as the case may be).  Each subsequent Interest Period in respect of each existing Drawing shall commence on the last date of the then ending Interest Period for such Drawing and expire at the end of the Interest Period selected by Borrower in accordance with this Letter of Offer.







Interest on the Loan shall be calculated on the above interest rate based on the actual days elapsed at a 360-day year and (except as provided below with respect to Interest Periods of twelve months duration) be paid on the last day of each Interest Period (each an “Interest Payment Date”).













2























Any Interest Period which would otherwise end on a non-Business Day shall instead end on the next Business Day in the same calendar month (if there is one) or on the preceding Business Day (if there is not).







Payment of Interest


Except otherwise provided in this Letter of Offer, the Borrower shall pay all interest accrued on the Loan during an Interest Period on the Interest Payment Date for that Interest Period. In case the Borrower opted for a twelve months interest period, the Borrower agrees and undertakes to pay the interest every three or six months upon consultation with the Bank.

Availability Period

Repayment Date


The date falling about three (3) years after the first advance under the Facility (such first advance and each such subsequent advance under the Facility, a “Drawing”) is made to the Borrower (each date of a Drawing, a “Drawdown Date”).  In the event of multiple drawdowns, the repayment date shall be determined as per each drawdown but in any event, it shall fall at least Fourteen Days before the expiry date of the SBLC or such later date as the Bank may decide at its discretion.







Default Interest


If the Borrower fails to pay any amount payable by it under this Letter of Offer when due, it shall pay interest to the Bank on the overdue amount on and from the due date of such payment to the date of actual payment, both before and after judgment, at the rate of 2% per annum above the applicable interest rate on the overdue amount immediately before the due date.

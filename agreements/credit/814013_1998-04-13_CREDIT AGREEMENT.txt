(i)     elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of
Reference Rate Loans, or as of the last day of the applicable Interest
Period, in the case of any other Type of Loans, to convert any such
Loans (or any part thereof in an amount not less than $1,000,000 or
that is in an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof) into
Loans of any other Type; or

(ii)    elect, as of the last day of the applicable
Interest Period, to continue any Loans having Interest Periods
expiring on such day (or any part thereof in an amount not less than
$1,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess
thereof);

provided, that if at any time the aggregate amount of Fixed Rate Loans or
Offshore Rate Loans in respect of any Borrowing is reduced, by payment,
prepayment, or conversion of part thereof to be less than $1,000,000, such
Fixed Rate Loans or Offshore Rate Loans shall automatically convert into
Reference Rate Loans, and on and after such date the right of Borrowers to
continue such Loans as, and convert such Loans into, Offshore Rate Loans or
Fixed Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall terminate.

(b)      Borrower Representative shall deliver a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation to be received by the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m.
(Chicago time) at least (i) three Business Days in advance of the
Conversion/Continuation Date, if the Loans are to be converted into or
continued as Offshore Rate Loans; (ii) on the Conversion/Continuation Date, if
the Loans are to be converted into or continued as Fixed Rate Loans; and (iii)
on the Conversion/Continuation Date, if the Loans are to be converted into
Reference Rate Loans, specifying:

(A)      the proposed Conversion/Continuation
Date;

(B)      the aggregate amount of Loans to be
converted or continued;

(C)      the Type of Loans resulting from the
proposed conversion or continuation; and

(D)      other than in the case of
conversions into Reference Rate Loans, the duration of the
requested Interest Period.

(c)      If upon the expiration of any Interest Period
applicable to Fixed Rate Loans or Offshore Rate Loans, Borrowers have failed to
select timely a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Fixed Rate Loans
or Offshore Rate Loans, as the case may be, or if any Default or Event of
Default then exists, Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to convert such
Fixed Rate Loans or Offshore Rate Loans into Reference Rate Loans effective as
of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

(d)      The Agent will promptly notify each Bank of its
receipt of a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, or, if no timely notice is
provided by Borrower Representative, the Agent will promptly notify each Bank
of the details of any automatic conversion.  All conversions and continuations
shall be made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts
of the Loans with respect to which the notice was given held by each Bank.

(e)      Unless the Majority Banks otherwise consent, during
the existence of a Default or Event of Default, Borrowers may not elect to have
a Loan converted into or continued as an Offshore Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate
Loan.






<PAGE>   22


(f)      After giving effect to any conversion or continuation
of Loans, unless the Agent shall otherwise consent, there may not be more than
five different Interest Periods in effect.

2.5     VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.  Borrowers
may, upon not less than five Business Days' prior notice to the Agent,
terminate the Commitments and this Agreement, or permanently reduce the
Commitments by an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 or any multiple of
$500,000 in excess thereof; unless, after giving effect thereto and to any
prepayments of Loans made on the effective date thereof, the sum of the
then-outstanding principal amount of the Loans, plus the L/C Facility
Commitment would exceed the amount of the combined Commitments then in effect.
Once reduced in accordance with this Section , the Commitments may not be
increased.  Any reduction of the Commitments shall be applied to each Bank
according to its Pro Rata Share.  All accrued commitment fees to, but not
including the effective date of any reduction or termination of Commitments,
shall be paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination.  Upon the
termination of the Commitments, this Agreement shall terminate, except for the
provisions of Article 3, Section 10.5 and such other provisions hereof which
are specified as surviving the payment of the Obligations.

2.6     OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Subject to Section 3.4, Borrowers may, at
any time or from time to time, upon irrevocable notice to the Agent, prepay
outstanding Loans in whole or in part, in minimum amounts of $1,000,000 or any
multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, with such notice to be received by the
Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) one Business Day prior to any
such prepayment.  Such notice of prepayment shall specify the date and amount
of such prepayment and the Loans to be prepaid.  The Agent will promptly notify
each Bank of its receipt of any such notice, and of such Bank's Pro Rata Share
of such prepayment.  If such notice is given by Borrowers, Borrowers shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due
and payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to
each such date on the amount prepaid and any amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.4.  Reference Rate Loans may be prepaid without prior notice.  Unless
the Agent is instructed otherwise by Borrowers in writing, any prepayments
pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be applied first to any Reference Rate
Loans.  Borrowers may from time to time (upon notice and procedures stated in
Section 2.3 hereof) reborrow amounts which have been paid by Borrowers as
optional prepayments.

2.7     LETTERS OF CREDIT.

(a)     Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the
representations and warranties herein set forth, the Issuing Bank agrees, at
any time and from time to time on or after the Closing Date until the
Termination Date, to issue and deliver or to extend the expiry of Letters of
Credit and/or Bankers Acceptances for the account of any Borrower in an
aggregate undrawn amount at any one time outstanding which does not exceed (i)
$19,000,000 during the period from January 15, 1997 through and including April
14, 1997, and (ii) $15,000,000 at all other times (the "L/C Facility
Commitment"); provided, however, that the Issuing Bank shall not issue or
extend the expiry of any Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance if, immediately
after giving effect to such issuance or extension the aggregate outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Loans and the LC Exposure would exceed the
aggregate Commitments.  Each Letter of Credit (x) shall be in a form approved
in writing by Borrower Representative, the Agent and the Issuing Bank, (y)
shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000 and (z) shall permit drawings
upon the presentation of one or more sight drafts, or one or more time drafts
for a period not to exceed six months, and such other documents as shall be
specified by Borrower Representative in the applicable notice and Application
delivered pursuant to subsection 2.7(c) below.

(b)     Each Letter of Credit shall by its terms expire not later than
the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the date of issuance or extension
(subject to extension for additional one-year periods by the Issuing Bank as
contemplated by paragraph (a) above) and (ii) the Termination Date.  Each
Bankers Acceptance shall have a term of six months or less.  Each Letter of
Credit and each Bankers Acceptance shall by its terms provide for payment of
drawings in dollars.

(c)     Borrower Representative shall give the Issuing Bank written or
telecopy notice not later than 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, two Business Days (or
such shorter period as shall be acceptable to the Issuing Bank and the







<PAGE>   23

Agent) prior to any proposed issuance of a Letter of Credit.  Each such notice
shall refer to this Agreement and shall specify (i) the date on which such
Letter of Credit is to be issued (which shall be a Business Day), the face
amount of such Letter of Credit (which shall be an amount in dollars), (ii) the
name and address of the beneficiary, (iii) whether such Letter of Credit shall
permit a single drawing or multiple drawings, (iv) the form of the sight draft
or time draft, as the case may be, and any other documents required to be
presented at the time of any drawing (together with the exact wording of such
documents or copies thereof) and (v) the expiry date of such Letter of Credit
(which shall conform to the provisions of paragraph (b) above).  At the time of
each request by Borrower Representative that a Letter of Credit be issued, the
Issuing Bank, at its option, may require Borrowers to execute and deliver to
the Issuing Bank an application for such Letter of Credit in the form
customarily prescribed by the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit (the
"Applications").  This Agreement supersedes any terms of the Applications which
are inconsistent with the terms hereof.  The Issuing Bank shall give the Agent,
which shall in turn give to each Bank, prompt written or telecopy advice of any
notice received from Borrower Representative pursuant to this subsection.

(d)     By the issuance of a Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance and
without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Banks in
respect thereof, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Bank, and each Bank
hereby agrees to and does acquire from the Issuing Bank, a participation in
such Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance equal to such Bank's pro rata
share, of the face amount of such Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance,
effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance;
provided, however, that no Bank shall be required to acquire participations in
Letters of Credit or Bankers Acceptances that would result in its Pro Rata
Share, based upon its Commitment, of the LC Exposure exceeding its Commitment.
In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Bank hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, on behalf of the
Issuing Bank, in accordance with subsection (f) below, such Bank's Pro Rata
Share, of each unreimbursed LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank; provided,
however, that the Banks shall not be obligated to make any such payment with
respect to any wrongful payment or disbursement made under any Letter of Credit
as a result of the failure in any material respect of the Issuing Bank or any
confirming bank to comply with the obligations imposed on it with respect to
such Letter of Credit by the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce, Publication No. 500
and subsequent revisions (the "Uniform Customs") or applicable law.

(e)     Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that its acquisition of
participations pursuant to subsection (d) above in respect of Letters of Credit
and Bankers Acceptances is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of any
Default or Event of Default hereunder, and that each such payment shall be made
without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

(f)     Promptly after it shall have ascertained that any draft and any
accompanying documents presented under a Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance
appear to be in conformity with the terms and conditions of such Letter of
Credit or Bankers Acceptance, the Issuing Bank shall give written or telecopy
notice to Borrowers and the Agent of the receipt and amount of such draft and
the date on which payment thereon will be made.  If the Agent shall not have
received from Borrowers the payment required pursuant to subsection (g) below
by 12:00 noon, Chicago time, one Business Day after the date on which payment
of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance has been
made, the Agent shall promptly so notify the Issuing Bank and each Bank,
specifying in the notice to each Bank such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such LC
Disbursement.  Each Bank shall pay to the Agent, not later than 2:00 p.m.,
Chicago time, on such date, such Bank's percentage of such LC Disbursement,
which the Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank.  The Agent will
promptly remit to each Bank such Bank's percentage of any amounts subsequently
received by the Agent from Borrowers in respect of such LC Disbursement;
provided that (i) amounts so received for the account of any Bank prior to
payment by such Bank of amounts required to be paid by it hereunder in respect
of any LC Disbursement and (ii) amounts representing interest on any LC
Disbursement for the period prior to the payment by such Bank of such amounts
shall in each case be remitted to the Issuing Bank.

(g)     If the Issuing Bank shall pay any draft presented under a Letter
of Credit or Bankers Acceptance under circumstances entitling it to
reimbursement under succeeding provisions of this subsection (g), Borrowers
shall pay to the Issuing Bank or to the Agent for the account of the Issuing
Bank or, if the Agent shall have received the







<PAGE>   24

payments provided in subsection (f) above with respect to such drawing, for the
accounts of the Banks, an amount equal to the amount of such draft before 12:00
noon, Chicago time, on the Business Day immediately following the date of
payment of such draft, together with interest on such amount at a rate per
annum equal to the interest rate in effect for Reference Rate Loans from (and
including) the date of payment of such draft to (but excluding) the date of
such payment by Borrowers.  The obligation of Borrowers to pay the amounts
referred to above in this subsection (g) shall be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable and shall be satisfied strictly in accordance with their terms
irrespective of:

(i)     any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or
Bankers Acceptance;

(ii)    the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which
any Borrower or any other Person may at any time have against the
beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Agent, the Issuing Bank, any
confirming bank or any Bank (other than the defense of payment in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or a defense based on the
failure in any material respect of the Issuing Bank or confirming bank
to comply with the obligations imposed on it with respect to such Letter
of Credit by the Uniform Customs or applicable law) or any other Person
in connection with this Agreement or any other transaction;

(iii)   any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit
proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; provided
that payment by the Issuing Bank or confirming bank under such Letter of
Credit against presentation of such draft or document shall not have
constituted a failure in any material respect by the Issuing Bank or
confirming bank to comply with the obligations imposed on it with
respect to such Letter of Credit by the Uniform Customs or applicable
law.

(iv)    payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or other document which does not comply in any
immaterial respect with the terms of such Letter of Credit; provided
that such payment shall not have constituted gross negligence or wilful
misconduct; or

(v)     any other circumstance or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing; provided that such other circumstance
or event shall not have been the.result of gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Issuing Bank.

It is understood that in making any payment under a Letter of Credit (x)
the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under
such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including,
without limitation, reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such
Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary equals the
amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such
Letter of Credit proves to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect, if
such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other
statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit
proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate
or untrue in any respect whatsoever, and (y) any noncompliance in any
immaterial respect of the documents presented under a Letter of Credit with the
terms thereof shall, in either case, not be deemed a failure in any material
respect by the Issuing Bank or confirming bank to comply with the obligations
imposed on it with respect to such Letter of Credit by the Uniform Customs or
applicable law.

(h)     Neither the Issuing Bank nor its correspondents or agents, or
any bank(s) or financial institution(s) used by the Issuing Bank in connection
with the issuance of Letters of Credit ("Correspondent"), shall be responsible
for (i) the use which may be made of the Letters of Credit or Bankers
Acceptances or for any acts or omissions of the user(s) of the Letters of
Credit or Bankers Acceptances; (ii) the existence, character, quality,
quantity, condition, packing or value of the property purporting to be
represented by the documents required by the terms of any Letters of Credit or
Bankers Acceptances or presented in connection therewith ("Documents"); (iii)
the time, place, manner or order in which shipment is made; (iv) except as
otherwise provided in subsection 2.7(g)(iii), the validity, sufficiency,





<PAGE>   25

or genuineness of Documents, or of any endorsements thereon, even if such
Documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
insufficient, fraudulent, or forged; (v) partial or incomplete shipment, or
failure or omission to ship any or all of the property referred to in the
Letters of Credit, Bankers Acceptances or the Documents; (vi) the character,
adequacy, validity or genuineness of any insurance or solvency or
responsibility of any insurer or any other risk connected with insurance; (vii)
any deviation from instructions, delay, default or fraud by the shipper or
anyone else in connection with the property referred to in the Letters of
Credit, Bankers Acceptances or the Documents or the shipping thereof; (viii)
the insolvency, responsibility or relationship to the property of any party
issuing any documents in connection with the property referred to in the
Letters of Credit; (ix) delay in arrival or failure to arrive of either the
property referred to in the Letters of Credit or the Documents; (x) delay in
giving or failure to give notice of arrival or any other notice; (xi) any
breach of contract between the shipper(s) or vendor(s) and the consignee(s) or
buyer(s); (xii) failure of any instrument to bear any reference or adequate
reference to the Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptances or failure of
Documents to accompany any instrument at negotiation, or failure of any person
to note the amount of any instrument on the reverse of the Letter of Credit or
Bankers Acceptances or to send forward Documents apart from instruments as
required by the terms of the Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptances or to send
forward Documents apart from instruments as required by the terms of the Letter
of Credit or Bankers Acceptances, each of which provisions, if contained in the
Letter of Credit or itself, it is agreed may be waived by the Issuing Bank or
Correspondent; or (xiii) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages by mail, cable, telegraph, wireless or
otherwise, whether or not they may be in cipher.  Further, the Issuing Bank
shall not be responsible for any act, error, neglect or default, omission,
insolvency or failure in business of any of its Correspondents.  The occurrence
of any one or more of the contingencies referred to in the preceding sentences
of this subsection 2.7(h) shall not affect, impair or prevent the vesting of
any of the Issuing Bank's rights or powers hereunder or Borrowers' obligation
to make reimbursement.  Borrowers shall promptly examine (i) the copy of the
Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance (and of any amendments thereof) sent to
it by the Issuing Bank or Correspondent and (ii) all documents and instruments
delivered to it from time to time by the Issuing Bank or Correspondent, and, in
the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrowers' instructions or other
irregularity, will promptly notify the Issuing Bank and Correspondent thereof
in writing, Borrowers being conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim
against the Issuing Bank and Correspondent unless such notice is given within
two Business Days following receipt by Borrowers of such Letter of Credit,
amendment, document or instrument.

(i)     Upon any transfer, sale, delivery, surrender or endorsement of
any bill of lading, warehouse receipt or other Document at any time(s) held by
the Issuing Bank, or held for its account by any of its correspondents or
agents, or any bank or financial institution used by the Issuing Bank in
connection with the issuance of Letters of Credit or Bankers Acceptances,
relative to the Letter of Credit or Bankers Acceptance, Borrowers will
indemnify and hold the Issuing Bank and any such correspondent(s), agent(s),
bank(s) and financial institution(s), harmless from and against each and every
claim, demand, action or suit which may arise against the Issuing Bank or any
correspondent(s), agent(s), bank(s) and financial institution(s), by reason
thereof."

2.8     REPAYMENT.  Borrowers shall repay to the Banks on the Revolving
Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding
on such date.

2.9     INTEREST.

(a)      Each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date at a rate per annum
equal to the Fixed Rate, the Offshore Rate or the Reference Rate, as the case
may be (and subject to Borrowers right to convert to other Types of Loans under
Section 2.4), plus the Applicable Margin.

(b)      Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date.  Interest shall also be paid on the date of any
prepayment of Loans under Section 2.6 for the portion of the Loans so prepaid
and upon payment (including prepayment) in full thereof and, during the
existence of any Event of Default, interest shall be paid on demand of the
Agent at the request or with the consent of the Majority Banks.







<PAGE>   26


(c)      Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section, while
any Event of Default exists or after acceleration, Borrowers shall pay interest
(after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by
law) on the principal amount of all outstanding Loans and other Obligations, at
a rate per annum which is determined by adding 2% per annum to the Applicable
Margin then in effect for such Loans and, in the case of Obligations not
subject to an Applicable Margin, at a rate per annum equal to the Reference
Rate plus 2%; provided, however, that, on and after the expiration of any
Interest Period applicable to any Offshore Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan
outstanding on the date of occurrence of such Event of Default or acceleration,
the principal amount of such Loan shall, during the continuation of such Event
of Default or after acceleration, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the Reference Rate plus 2%.

(d)      Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the
obligations of Borrowers to any Bank hereunder shall be subject to the
limitation that payments of interest shall not be required for any period for
which interest is computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent)
that contracting for or receiving such payment by such Bank would be contrary
to the provisions of any law applicable to such Bank limiting the highest rate
of interest that may be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such
Bank, and in such event Borrowers shall pay such Bank interest at the highest
rate permitted by applicable law.

2.10    FEES.

(a)      AGENCY FEE.  Holding Co. shall pay an agency fee to the
Agent for the Agent's own account, as required by the letter agreement ("Fee
Letter") between Holding Co. and the Agent dated November 15, 1996.

(b)      UNUSED LOAN FEE.  If during any calendar quarter prior
to the Termination Date (or portion of the calendar quarter for 1996 and the
calendar quarter in which the Termination Date occurs), the average daily
balance of the Revolving Loan is less than $45,000,000, Borrowers shall pay to
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Banks, in addition to any interest, late
charges or liquidated damages due under this Agreement, an amount ("Unused Loan
Fee") equal to the quotient of (i) an amount equal to (A) the positive
difference between $45,000,000 and the average daily balance of the Revolving
Loan during such calendar quarter (or portion of the calendar quarter for 1996
and the calendar quarter in which the Termination Date occurs), multiplied by
(B) a rate equal to 0.15%, divided by (ii) four.  The amount of any Unused
Revolving Loan Fee shall be payable within five days after determination
thereof by Agent and notice to Borrowers of the amount thereof.

(c)      L/C FEES.  Borrowers agree to pay (i) to the Agent, for
the ratable benefit of the Banks, a per annum fee ("LC Issuance Fee"), payable
quarterly, in arrears, prorated for any period less than one year based on the
Issuing Bank's customary practices, (a) with respect to the Letters of Credit
which are cash collateralized in a manner acceptable to the Issuing Bank, equal
to 0.125% of the undrawn face amount of such Letter of Credit from time to
time, and (b) with respect to all other Letters of Credit, equal to 0.375% of
the undrawn face amount of such Letter of Credit from time to time, and in any
event the LC Issuance Fee shall not be less than $150, plus (ii) to the Issuing
Bank, for the Issuing Bank's own account and not for the account of any Bank,
in addition to the LC Issuance Fee, the Issuing Bank's standard administrative
operating fees and charges in effect from time to time for issuing and
administering any Letter of Credit.  In the event the Issuing Bank consents to
the extension of the term ("Extended Term") of a Letter of Credit beyond the
term specified in subsection 2.7(b) ("Extended Letter of Credit"), then
Borrowers shall pay an additional LC Issuance Fee with respect to each Extended
Letter of Credit for each year or partial year the terms of such Extended
Letter of Credit extends beyond the term specified in subsection 2.7(b).  With
respect to the payment of any fees or expenses that become due hereunder,
Borrowers authorize and direct the Agent, at its option, to cause such payment
to be paid when due by charging such payment as a Revolving Loan advance
against the Revolving Loan Commitment established pursuant to Section 2.1 of
this Agreement.





<PAGE>   27


2.11    COMPUTATION OF FEES AND INTEREST.

(a)      All computations of interest for Reference Rate Loans
when the Reference Rate is determined by BA's "reference rate" shall be made on
the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days
elapsed.  All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the
basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest
being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest and fees
shall accrue during each period during which interest or such fees are computed
from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.

(b)      Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent
shall be conclusive and binding on Borrowers and the Banks in the absence of
manifest error. The Agent will, at the request of Borrowers or any Bank,
deliver to Borrowers or the Bank, as the case may be, a statement showing the
quotations used by the Agent in determining any interest rate and the resulting
interest rate.

2.12    PAYMENTS BY BORROWERS.

(a)      All payments to be made by Borrowers shall be made
without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim.  Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, all payments by Borrowers shall be made to the Agent for the
account of the Banks at the Agent's Payment Office, and shall be made in
dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago
time) on the date specified herein.  The Agent will promptly distribute to each
Bank its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided
herein) of such payment in like funds as received.  Any payment received by the
Agent later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) shall be deemed to have been received
on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue
to accrue.

(b)      Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition
of "Interest Period" herein, whenever any payment is due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
interest or fees, as the case may be.

(c)      Unless the Agent receives notice from Borrowers prior
to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks that Borrowers will not
make such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that
Borrowers have made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in
immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required),
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Bank on such due date an
amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.  If and to the extent Borrowers
have not made such payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the
Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with interest
thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Bank until the date repaid.







<PAGE>   28
2.13    PAYMENTS BY THE BANKS TO THE AGENT.

(a)      Unless the Agent receives notice from a Bank on or
prior to the Closing Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the Closing
Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such
Bank will not make available as and when required hereunder to the Agent for
the account of Borrowers the amount of that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that each Bank has made such amount available
to the Agent in immediately available funds on the Borrowing Date and the Agent
may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to Borrowers on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the
extent any Bank shall not have made its full amount available to the Agent in
immediately available funds and the Agent in such circumstances has made
available to Borrowers such amount, that Bank shall on the Business Day
following such Borrowing Date make such amount available to the Agent, together
with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such period.  A
notice of the Agent submitted to any Bank with respect to amounts owing under
this subsection (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  If such amount
is so made available, such payment to the Agent shall constitute such Bank's
Loan on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement.  If such
amount is not made available to the Agent on the Business Day following the
Borrowing Date, the Agent will notify Borrowers of such failure to fund and,
upon demand by the Agent, Borrowers shall pay such amount to the Agent for the
Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the
date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

(b)      The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any
Borrowing Date shall not relieve any other Bank of any obligation hereunder to
make a Loan on such Borrowing Date, but no Bank shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on any
Borrowing Date.

2.14    SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.  If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share (or other share
contemplated hereunder), such Bank shall immediately (a) notify the Agent of
such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Banks such participations in the
Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share
the excess payment pro rata with each of them; provided, however, that if all
or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the
purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other
Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price paid therefor,
together with an amount equal to such paying Bank's ratable share (according to
the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Bank's required repayment to
(ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or
other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total
amount so recovered.  Borrowers agree that any Bank so purchasing a
participation from another Bank may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject
to Section 10.10) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank
were the direct creditor of Borrowers in the amount of such participation.  The
Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence
of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in
each case notify the Banks following any such purchases or repayments.

2.15    APPOINTMENT OF BORROWER REPRESENTATIVE.  Each Borrower hereby
designates Holding Co. as its representative and agent on its behalf for the
purposes of issuing Notices of Borrowing and Notices of
Conversion/Continuation, giving instructions with respect to the disbursement
of the proceeds of the Loans, selecting interest rate options, requesting
Letters of Credit and Bankers Acceptances, giving and receiving all other
notices and consents hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents and
taking all other actions (including in respect of compliance with covenants) on
behalf of any Borrower or Borrowers under the Loan Documents.  Borrower
Representative hereby accepts such appointment.  Agent and each Bank may regard
any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document from Borrower
Representative as a notice or communication from all Borrowers, and may give
any notice or communication required or permitted to be given to any Borrower
or Borrowers hereunder to Borrower Representative on behalf of such Borrower or
Borrowers.  Each Borrower agrees that each notice, election, representation and
warranty, covenant, agreement and undertaking made on its behalf by Borrower
Representative shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such
Borrower and shall be binding





<PAGE>   29

upon and enforceable against such Borrower to the same extent as if the same
had been made directly by such Borrower.

ARTICLE 3

TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

3.1     TAXES.

(a)      Any and all payments by Borrowers to each Bank or the
Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes.  In addition,
Borrowers shall pay all Other Taxes.

(b)      If Borrowers shall be required by law to deduct or
withhold any Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder to any Bank or the Agent, then:

(i)      the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings
(including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section), such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be,
receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it would have received
and retained had no such deductions or withholdings been made;

(ii)     Borrowers shall make such deductions and
withholdings;

(iii)    Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law; and

(iv)     Borrowers shall also pay to each Bank or the
Agent for the account of such Bank, at the time interest is paid,
Further Taxes in the amount that the respective Bank specifies as
necessary to preserve the after-tax yield the Bank would have
received if such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes had not been
imposed.

(c)      Borrowers agree to indemnify and hold harmless each
Bank and the Agent for the full amount of i) Taxes, ii) Other Taxes, and iii)
Further Taxes in the amount that the respective Bank specifies as necessary to
preserve the after-tax yield the Bank would have received if such Taxes, Other
Taxes or Further Taxes had not been imposed, and any liability (including
penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted.  Payment under this indemnification shall be
made within 30 days after the date the Bank or the Agent makes written demand
therefor.

(d)      If any Bank becomes entitled to claim any
indemnification payment pursuant to this Section 3.1, it shall notify Borrowers
thereof within 90 days after such Bank becomes aware of the nature and extent
of such claim and shall also notify Agent thereof.  A certificate as to any
additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.1 submitted by a Bank to
Borrowers shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Such certificate shall
outline in reasonable detail the computation of any amounts claimed by it under
this Section 3.1 and the assumptions underlying such computation.  No Bank
shall, however, be required to disclose, in such certificate or otherwise, any
proprietary or confidential information.  No Bank shall be entitled to any
indemnification payment under this Section 3.1 unless it shall have notified
Borrowers that it will demand indemnification not later than 90 days after the
date on which the Bank becomes aware of the nature and extent of the claim.

(e)      Within 30 days after the date of any payment by
Borrowers of Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes, Borrowers shall furnish to
each Bank or the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment thereof, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to such Bank or the
Agent.






<PAGE>   30


(f)      If Borrowers are required to pay any amount to any Bank
or the Agent pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this Section, then such Bank
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory
restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to
eliminate any such additional payment by Borrowers which may thereafter accrue,
if such change in the sole judgment of such Bank is not otherwise
disadvantageous to such Bank.

3.2     ILLEGALITY.

(a)      If any Bank determines that the introduction of any
Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the
interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it
unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted
that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its applicable Lending Office to make
Offshore Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof by the Bank to Borrowers through
the Agent, any obligation of that Bank to make Offshore Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Bank notifies the Agent and Borrowers that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

(b)      If a Bank determines that it is unlawful to maintain
any Offshore Rate Loan, Borrowers shall, upon its receipt of notice of such
fact and demand from such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), prepay in full such
Offshore Rate Loans of that Bank then outstanding, together with interest
accrued thereon and amounts required under Section 3.4, either on the last day
of the Interest Period thereof, if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain
such Offshore Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Bank may not
lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loan.  If Borrowers are
required to so prepay any Offshore Rate Loan, then concurrently with such
prepayment, Borrowers shall borrow from the affected Bank, in the amount of
such repayment, a Reference Rate Loan.

(c)      If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain
Offshore Rate Loans has been so terminated or suspended, Borrowers may elect,
by giving notice to the Bank through the Agent that all Loans which would
otherwise be made by the Bank as Offshore Rate Loans shall be instead Reference
Rate Loans.

(d)      Before giving any notice to the Agent under this
Section, the affected Bank shall designate a different Lending Office with
respect to its Offshore Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for
giving such notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the
Bank, be illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Bank.

3.3     INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCTION OF RETURN.

(a)      If any Bank determines that, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance by that Bank with any guideline or request
from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having
the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Bank of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Offshore Rate Loans or
Fixed Rate Loans, then Borrowers shall be liable for, and shall from time to
time, upon demand (with a copy of such demand to be sent to the Agent), pay to
the Agent for the account of such Bank, additional amounts as are sufficient to
compensate such Bank for such increased costs.

(b)      If any Bank shall have determined that (i) the
introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital
Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration
of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental
Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or (iv)
compliance by the Bank (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling
the Bank with any Capital Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by the Bank or any
corporation controlling the Bank and (taking into consideration such Bank's or
such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's
desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is
increased as a consequence of its Commitments, loans,






<PAGE>   31

credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such Bank to
Borrowers through the Agent, Borrowers shall pay to the Bank, from time to time
as specified by the Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank
for such increase.

(c)      Upon receiving a demand to pay amounts pursuant to
subsection 3.3(a) or 3.3(b), Borrowers may require the applicable Bank to
provide an opinion from such Bank's legal counsel or independent accountants to
the effect that (i) events of the type described in subsection 3.3(a) or
3.3(b), as the case may be, have occurred, and (ii) as a result of the
occurrence of such events, the Bank has incurred costs of the type described in
subsection 3.3(a) or 3.3(b), as the case may be.  The fees and expenses of the
legal counsel or independent accountants of the Bank shall be borne by
Borrowers.

3.4     FUNDING LOSSES.  Borrowers shall reimburse each Bank and hold
each Bank harmless from any loss or expense which the Bank may sustain or incur
as a consequence of:

(a)      the failure of Borrowers to make on a timely basis any
payment of principal of any Offshore Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan;

(b)      the failure of Borrowers to borrow, continue or convert
a Loan after Borrowers have given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of
Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/ Continuation;

(c)      the failure of Borrowers to make any prepayment in
accordance with any notice delivered under Section 2.6;

(d)      the prepayment or other payment (including after
acceleration thereof) of an Offshore Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan on a day
that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; or

(e)      the automatic conversion under Section 2.4 of any
Offshore Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan to a Reference Rate Loan on a day that is
not the last day of the relevant Interest Period;

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its Offshore Rate Loans or Fixed Rate Loans
or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were
obtained.  For purposes of calculating amounts payable by Borrowers to the
Banks under this Section and under subsection 3.3(a), (i) each Offshore Rate
Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the LIBOR used
in determining the Offshore Rate for such Offshore Rate Loan by a matching
deposit or other borrowing in the interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan is
in fact so funded, and (ii) each Fixed Rate Loan made by a Bank (and each
related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be conclusively
deemed to have been funded at the rate used in determining the Fixed Rate for
such Fixed Rate Loan by the issuance of Agent's certificate of deposit in a
comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Fixed Rate
Loan is in fact so funded.

3.5     INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES.  If the Agent determines that for
any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the
Offshore Rate or the Fixed Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect
to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan, or that the Offshore Rate
or the Fixed Rate applicable pursuant to subsection 2.9(a) for any requested
Interest Period with respect to a proposed Offshore Rate Loan or Fixed Rate
Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Banks of funding
such Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify Borrowers and each Bank.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Fixed Rate Loans or
Offshore Rate Loans, as the case may be, hereunder shall be suspended until the
Agent upon the instruction of the Majority Banks revokes such notice in
writing.  Upon receipt of such notice, Borrowers may revoke any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it.  If
Borrowers do not revoke such Notice, the Banks shall make, convert or continue
the Loans, as proposed by Borrowers, in the amount specified in the applicable



<PAGE>   32

notice submitted by Borrowers, but such Loans shall be made, converted or
continued as Reference Rate Loans instead of Fixed Rate Loans or Offshore Rate
Loans, as the case may be.

3.6     RESERVES ON OFFSHORE RATE LOANS.  Borrowers shall pay to each
Bank, as long as such Bank shall be required under regulations of the FRB to
maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency
liabilities"), additional costs on the unpaid principal amount of each Offshore
Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by
the Bank (as determined by the Bank in good faith, which determination shall be
conclusive), payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,
provided Borrowers shall have received at least 15 days' prior written notice
(with a copy to the Agent) of such additional interest from the Bank.  If a
Bank fails to give notice 15 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date,
such additional interest shall be payable 15 days from receipt of such notice.

3.7     CERTIFICATES OF BANKS.  Any Bank claiming reimbursement or
compensation under this Article 3 shall deliver to Borrowers (with a copy to
the Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable
to the Bank hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on
Borrowers in the absence of manifest error.

3.8     SUBSTITUTION OF BANKS.  Upon the receipt by Borrowers from any
Bank (an "Affected Bank") of a claim for compensation under Section 3.3,
Borrowers may:  (i) request the Affected Bank to use its best efforts to obtain
a replacement bank or financial institution satisfactory to Borrowers to
acquire and assume all or a ratable part of all of such Affected Bank's Loans
and Commitment (a "Replacement Bank"); (ii) request one more of the other Banks
to acquire and assume all or part of such Affected Bank's Loans and Commitment;
or (iii) designate a Replacement Bank.  Any such designation of a Replacement
Bank under clause (i) or (iii) shall be subject to the prior written consent of
the Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

3.9     SURVIVAL.  The agreements and obligations of Borrowers in this
Article 3 shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation;

except, in each case referred to in clause (c) or clause (d), to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material

delivery and performance by each Borrower and its Subsidiaries of this
Agreement and each other Loan Document to which such Person is party, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not and will not:

(a)      contravene the terms of any of that Person's
Organization Documents;

(b)      conflict with or result in any breach or contravention
of, or the creation of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual
Obligation to which such Person is a party or any order, injunction, writ or

subject; or

(c)      violate any Requirement of Law.

there are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims or disputes pending, or to the
best knowledge of Borrowers, threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in

(a)      purport to affect or pertain to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;

reasonably expects to incur, any liability (and no event has occurred which,
with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such
liability) under Section 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer
Plan; and (v) neither any Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a
transaction that could be subject to Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

record and marketable title in fee simple to, or valid leasehold interests in,

the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  As of the Closing Date, the
property of each Borrower and its Subsidiaries is subject to no Liens, other
than Permitted Liens.

5.10    TAXES.  Each Borrower and its Subsidiaries has filed all Federal

charges levied or imposed upon them or their properties, income or assets
otherwise due and payable, except those which are being contested in good faith

statements of income or operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the

consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as
otherwise expressly noted therein, subject to ordinary, good
faith year end audit adjustments;

applicable Environmental Laws and no Environmental Claims have been asserted
against any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which in either case could,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.13    REGULATED ENTITIES.  No Borrower, no Person controlling any
Borrower, and no Subsidiary, is an "Investment Company" within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act of 1940.  No Borrower is subject to regulation under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the
Interstate Commerce Act, any state public utilities code, or any other Federal
or state statute or regulation limiting its ability to incur Indebtedness.

5.14    NO BURDENSOME RESTRICTIONS.  Neither any Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any Contractual Obligation, or subject to
any restriction in any Organization Document, or any Requirement of Law, any of
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.15    COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES, ETC.  Each

use all of the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights,
contractual franchises, authorizations and other rights that are reasonably
necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, without conflict
with the rights of any other Person.  To the best knowledge of Borrowers, no
slogan or other advertising device, product, process, method, substance, part
or other material now employed, or now






<PAGE>   37

contemplated to be employed, by any Borrower or any Subsidiary infringes upon
any rights held by any other Person.  Except as specifically disclosed in
Schedule 5.5, no claim or litigation regarding any of the foregoing is pending
or threatened, and no patent, invention, device, application, principle or any
statute, law, rule, regulation, standard or code is pending or, to the

relating to any such Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation, and such failure
continues after the applicable grace or notice period, if any, specified in the




<PAGE>   46

relevant document on the date of such failure if the effect of such failure,
event or condition is to cause, or to permit the holder or holders of
such Indebtedness or beneficiary or beneficiaries of such Indebtedness (or a

beneficiaries) to cause such Indebtedness to be declared to be due and payable
prior to its stated maturity, or such Contingent Obligation to become payable

the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator,

effect; or

(k)      CHANGE OF CONTROL.  There occurs any Change of Control;
or

suffers the imposition of any restraining order, escrow, suspension or impound
of funds in connection with any proceeding (judicial or administrative) with
respect to any material license, permit or franchise; or

(b)      declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding
Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or

payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all
of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrowers; and

(c)      exercise on behalf of itself and the Banks all rights
and remedies available to it and the Banks under the Loan Documents or
applicable law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any event specified in

(g) upon the expiration of the 60-day period mentioned therein), the obligation
of each Bank to make Loans shall automatically terminate and the unpaid

Agent or any Bank.

8.3     RIGHTS NOT EXCLUSIVE.  The rights provided for in this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
rights, powers, privileges or remedies provided by law or in equity, or under

ARTICLE 9

THE AGENT

9.1     APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION; "AGENT".  Each Bank hereby
irrevocably (subject to Section 9.9) appoints, designates and authorizes the
Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement
and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such
duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in
this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any
duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall
the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank,
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise exist against the Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with
reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market
custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties.

9.2     DELEGATION OF DUTIES.  The Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees
or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties.  The Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with
reasonable care.

9.3     LIABILITY OF AGENT.  None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i)
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or
in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the







<PAGE>   48

transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Banks
for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Borrower or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Borrower, or any officer thereof, contained
in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Borrower
or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder.  No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Bank
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Borrower or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Borrower.

9.4     RELIANCE BY AGENT.

(a)      The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone
message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel
to Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent.
The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive
such advice or concurrence of the Majority Banks as it deems appropriate and,
if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of
the Majority Banks and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Banks.

(b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the
conditions specified in Section 4.1, each Bank that has executed this Agreement
shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied
with, each document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Bank for
consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank.

9.5     NOTICE OF DEFAULT.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees
required to be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Agent
shall have received written notice from a Bank or Borrowers referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default".  The Agent will notify the Banks of its
receipt of any such notice.  The Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Majority Banks in
accordance with Article 8; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent
has received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest
of the Banks.

9.6     CREDIT DECISION.  Each Bank acknowledges that none of the
Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that
no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Bank.  Each Bank
represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
credit worthiness of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank
regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrowers
hereunder.  Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,










<PAGE>   49

prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and credit
worthiness of Borrowers.  Except for notices, reports and other documents
expressly herein required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent, the Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit
or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition or credit worthiness of Borrowers which may come
into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

9.7     INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT.  Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Banks shall indemnify upon demand the
Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of
Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of Borrowers to do so), pro rata,
from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that
no Bank shall be liable for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any
portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Bank shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any
costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the
Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any
document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is
not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrowers.  The undertaking
in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the
resignation or replacement of the Agent.

9.8     AGENT IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.  BA and its Affiliates may make
loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with any Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though BA were not the Agent hereunder and
without notice to or consent of the Banks.  The Banks acknowledge that,
pursuant to such activities, BA or its Affiliates may receive information
regarding any Borrower or its Affiliates (including information that may be
subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Borrower or such
Affiliates) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to
provide such information to them.  With respect to its Loans, BA shall have the
same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Bank and may exercise
the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Bank" and "Banks"
include BA in its individual capacity.

9.9     SUCCESSOR AGENT.  The Agent may, and at the request of the
Majority Banks shall, resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks.  If
the Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Majority Banks shall appoint from
among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks which successor agent shall be
approved by Borrowers.  If no successor agent is appointed prior to the
effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Banks and Borrowers, a successor agent from among the
Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder,
such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the
retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Article 9 and Sections 10.4 and 10.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement.  If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and
the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Majority Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for
above.

9.10    WITHHOLDING TAX.

(a)      If any Bank is a "foreign corporation, partnership or
trust" within the meaning of the Code and such Bank claims exemption from, or a
reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code,
such Bank agrees with and in favor of the Agent, to deliver to the Agent:

(i)      if such Bank claims an exemption from, or a
reduction of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, two
properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form 1001 before the
payment of






<PAGE>   50
any interest in the first calendar year and before the payment of
any interest in each third succeeding calendar year during which
interest may be paid under this Agreement;

(ii)     if such Bank claims that interest paid under
this Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it
is effectively connected with a United States trade or business of
such Bank, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form 4224
before the payment of any interest is due in the first taxable year of
such Bank and in each succeeding taxable year of such Bank during which
interest may be paid under this Agreement; and

(iii)   such other form or forms as may be required
under the Code or other laws of the United States as a condition
to exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding tax.

Such Bank agrees to promptly notify the Agent of any change in circumstances
which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

(b)      If any Bank claims exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form 1001 and
such Bank sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all
or part of the Obligations of Borrowers to such Bank, such Bank agrees to
notify the Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the
beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrowers to such Bank.  To the extent of
such percentage amount, the Agent will treat such Bank's IRS Form 1001 as no
longer valid.

(c)      If any Bank claiming exemption from United States
withholding tax by filing IRS Form 4224 with the Agent sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of
Borrowers to such Bank, such Bank agrees to undertake sole responsibility for
complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and
1442 of the Code.

(d)      If any Bank is entitled to a reduction in the
applicable withholding tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to
such Bank an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking
into account such reduction.  However, if the forms or other documentation
required by subsection (a) of this Section are not delivered to the Agent, then
the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Bank not providing
such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable
withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without
reduction.

(e)     If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority
of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did
not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank
(because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed,
or because such Bank failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances
which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax
ineffective, or for any other reason) such Bank shall indemnify the Agent fully
for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise,
including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Agent under this Section, together
with all costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs).  The obligation of the
Banks under this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and
the resignation or replacement of the Agent.


ARTICLE 10

MISCELLANEOUS

10.1    AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT; AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS.

(a)     This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the
Original Credit Agreement and, upon the effectiveness of this Agreement,
the terms and provisions of the Original Credit Agreement shall, subject



<PAGE>   51

to this Section 10.1(a), be superseded hereby and thereby.  All
references to "Credit Agreement" contained in the other Loan Documents
delivered in connection with the Original Credit Agreement shall be
deemed to refer to this Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
Notwithstanding the amendment and restatement of the Original Credit
Agreement by this Agreement, the Obligations owing to the Banks and the
Agent by Borrower under the Original Credit Agreement remain
outstanding as of the date hereof and constitute continuing Borrowers'
Obligations hereunder.  The Obligations shall in all respects be
continuing, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to evidence or result
in a novation or repayment and reborrowing of the Obligations.  In
furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
date of this Agreement, the terms, conditions and covenants governing
the Obligations shall be solely as set forth in this Agreement, which
shall supersede the Original Credit Agreement in its entirety.

(b)     No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any
departure by any Borrower or any applicable Subsidiary therefrom, shall
be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Majority Banks (or by the Agent at the written request of the Majority
Banks) and Borrowers and acknowledged by the Agent, and then any
such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no
such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed
by all the Banks and Borrowers and acknowledged by the Agent, do any of
the following:

(i)      increase or extend the Commitment of any Bank (or
reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant to Section 8.2);

(ii)     postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or
any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other
amounts due to the Banks (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan
Document;

(iii)    reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest
specified herein on any Loan, or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or
under any other Loan Document;

(iv)     change the percentage of the Commitments or of the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans which is required for the Banks
or any of them to take any action hereunder; or

(v)      amend this Section, or Section 2.14, or any provision
herein providing for consent or other action by all Banks;

and, provided further, that (vi) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless
in writing and signed by the Agent in addition to the Majority Banks or all the
Banks, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

10.2    NOTICES.

(a)      All notices, requests, consents, approvals, waivers and
other communications shall be in writing (including, unless the context
expressly otherwise provides, by facsimile transmission, provided that any
matter transmitted by Borrowers or Borrower Representative by facsimile (i)
shall be immediately confirmed by a telephone call to the recipient at the
number specified on Schedule 10.2, and (ii) shall be followed promptly by
delivery of a hard copy original thereof) and mailed, faxed or delivered, to
the address or facsimile number specified for notices on Schedule 10.2; or, as
directed to Borrowers or the Agent, to such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties, and as
directed to any other party, at such other address as shall be designated by
such party in a written notice to Borrowers and the Agent.

(b)      All such notices, requests and communications shall,
when transmitted by overnight delivery, or faxed, be effective when delivered
for overnight (next-day) delivery, or transmitted in legible form by






<PAGE>   52

facsimile machine, respectively, or if mailed, upon the third Business Day
after the date deposited into the U.S. mail, or if delivered, upon delivery;
except that notices pursuant to Article 2 or 9 to the Agent shall not be
effective until actually received by the Agent.

(c)      Any agreement of the Agent and the Banks herein to
receive certain notices by telephone or facsimile is solely for the convenience
and at the request of Borrowers.  The Agent and the Banks shall be entitled to
rely on the authority of any Person purporting to be a Person authorized by
Borrowers to give such notice and the Agent and the Banks shall not have any
liability to Borrowers or other Person on account of any action taken or not
taken by the Agent or the Banks in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile
notice.  The obligation of Borrowers to repay the Loans shall not be affected
in any way or to any extent by any failure by the Agent and the Banks to
receive written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the
receipt by the Agent and the Banks of a confirmation which is at variance with
the terms understood by the Agent and the Banks to be contained in the
telephonic or facsimile notice.

10.3    NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES.  No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Bank, any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof;  nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege.

10.4    COSTS AND EXPENSES.  Borrowers shall:

(a)      whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, pay or reimburse BA (including in its capacity as Agent) and each
Bank within five Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 4.1(f)) for
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by BA (including in its capacity as
Agent) and each Bank in connection with the development, preparation, delivery
and execution of, and any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to (in
each case, whether or not consummated), this Agreement, any Loan Document and
any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by BA (including in its capacity as Agent)
and any Bank with respect thereto; and

(b)      pay or reimburse the Agent and each Bank within five
Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 4.1(f)) for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by them in connection
with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or
remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document during the existence
of an Event of Default or after acceleration of the Loans (including in
connection with any "workout" or restructuring regarding the Loans, and
including in any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding).

10.5    BORROWERS' INDEMNIFICATION.  Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, each Borrower, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify, defend and hold the Agent-Related Persons, and each Bank and
each of its respective officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and
attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses and disbursements (including
Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time
(including at any time following repayment of the Loans and the termination,
resignation or replacement of the Agent or replacement of any Bank)  be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any document contemplated by or referred to
herein, or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken or omitted
by any such Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing, including
with respect to any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any
Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Loans or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not
any Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, that Borrowers shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities
resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Person. The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all
other Obligations.





<PAGE>   53


10.6    PAYMENTS SET ASIDE.  To the extent that Borrowers make a payment
to the Agent or the Banks, or the Agent or the Banks exercise their right of
set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Agent or such Bank in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise,
then (a) to the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof
originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full
force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not
occurred, and (b) each Bank severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand
its pro rata share of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Agent.

10.7    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, except that Borrowers may not assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the Agent and each Bank.

10.8    ASSIGNMENTS, PARTICIPATIONS, ETC.

(a)      Any Bank may, with the written consent of the Agent,
which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, at any time assign and
delegate to one or more Eligible Assignees (provided that no written consent of
the Agent shall be required in connection with any assignment and delegation by
a Bank to an Eligible Assignee that is an Affiliate of such Bank) (each an
"Assignee") all, or any ratable part of all, of the Loans, the Commitments and
the other rights and obligations of such Bank hereunder, in a minimum amount
equal to the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) the remaining amount of such
Bank's Commitments; provided, however, that Borrowers and the Agent may
continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with the
interest so assigned to an Assignee until (i) written notice of such
assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses and related
information with respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to Borrowers
and the Agent by such Bank and the Assignee; (ii) such Bank and its Assignee
shall have delivered to Borrowers and the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in
the form of Exhibit E ("Assignment and Acceptance") together with any Note or
Notes subject to such assignment and (iii) the assignor Bank or Assignee has
paid to the Agent a processing fee in the amount of $2,500.

(b)      From and after the date that the Agent notifies the
assignor Bank that it has received (and provided its consent with respect to)
an executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the above-referenced
processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a
Bank under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Bank shall, to the extent
that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have
been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its
rights and be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents.

(c)      Within five Business Days after its receipt of notice
by the Agent that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance and
payment of the processing fee, Borrowers shall execute and deliver to the
Agent, new Notes evidencing such Assignee's assigned Loans and Commitment and,
if the assignor Bank has retained a portion of its Loans and its Commitment,
replacement Notes in the principal amount of the Loans retained by the assignor
Bank (such Notes to be in exchange for, but not in payment of, the Notes held
by such Bank).  Immediately upon each Assignee's making its processing fee
payment under the Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to
be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the
addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments
arising therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such
Commitments of the assigning Bank pro tanto.

(d)      Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more commercial
banks or other Persons not Affiliates of Borrowers (a "Participant")
participating interests in any Loans, the Commitment of that Bank and the other
interests of that Bank (the "originating Bank") hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents; provided, however, that (i) the originating Bank's obligations
under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the originating





<PAGE>   54

Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations,
(_)(iii) Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly
with the originating Bank in connection with the originating Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (iv) no Bank
shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant
has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect
to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent such
amendment, consent or waiver would require unanimous consent of the Banks as
described in the first proviso to Section 10.1. In the case of any such
participation, the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections
3.1, 3.3 and 10.5 as though it were also a Bank hereunder, and if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been
declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in
respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to
the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing
directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement.

(e)      Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
any Bank may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any
portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement and the Note held by
it in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the
FRB or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR Section 203.14, and such Federal Reserve
Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under
applicable law.

10.9    CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each Bank agrees to take and to cause its
Affiliates to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to
maintain the confidentiality of all information identified as "confidential" or
"secret"  by Borrowers and provided to it by any Borrower or any Subsidiary, or
by the Agent on such Borrower's or such Subsidiary's behalf, under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates
shall use any such information other than in connection with or in enforcement
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with other
business now or hereafter existing or contemplated with any Borrower or any
Subsidiary; except to the extent such information (i) was or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Bank, or
(ii) was or becomes available on a  non-confidential basis from a source other
than any Borrower, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with any Borrower known to the Bank; provided, however, that any Bank
may disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement
of any Governmental Authority to which the Bank is subject or in connection
with an examination of such Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant to
subpoena or other court process; (C) when required to do so in accordance with
the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which
the Agent, any Bank or their respective Affiliates may be party; (E) to the
extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy
hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (F) to such Bank's independent
auditors and other professional advisors; (G) to any Participant or Assignee,
actual or potential, provided that such Person agrees in writing to keep such
information confidential to the same extent required of the Banks hereunder;
(H) as to any Bank or its Affiliate, as expressly permitted under the terms of
any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which any Borrower
or any Subsidiary is party or is deemed party with such Bank or such Affiliate;
and (I) to its Affiliates.

10.10   SET-OFF.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been
accelerated, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time to time, without
prior notice to Borrowers, any such notice being waived by Borrowers to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by,
and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Bank to or for the credit or
the account of any Borrower against any and all Obligations owing to such Bank,
now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Agent or such
Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and
although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.  Each Bank agrees
promptly to notify Borrowers and the Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

10.11   AUTOMATIC DEBITS OF FEES.  With respect to any fee, or any other
cost or expense (including Attorney Costs) due and payable to the Agent, BA or
BA under the Loan Documents, Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize






<PAGE>   55

BA to debit any deposit account of any Borrower with BA in an amount such that
the aggregate amount debited from all such deposit accounts does not exceed
such fee or other cost or expense.  If there are insufficient funds in such
deposit accounts to cover the amount of the fee or other cost or expense then
due, such debits will be reversed (in whole or in part, in BA's sole
discretion) and such amount not debited shall be deemed to be unpaid.  No such
debit under this Section shall be deemed a set-off.

10.12   NOTIFICATION OF ADDRESSES, LENDING OFFICES, ETC.  Each Bank
shall notify the Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which
notices to the Bank should be directed, of addresses of any Lending Office, of
payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it hereunder and
of such other administrative information as the Agent shall reasonably request.

10.13   COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an
original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute but one and the same instrument.

10.14   SEVERABILITY.  The illegality or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder
shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required
hereunder.

10.15   NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED.  This Agreement is made and entered
into for the sole protection and legal benefit of Borrowers, the Banks, the
Agent and the Agent-Related Persons, and their permitted successors and
assigns, and no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary
of, or have any direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with,
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

10.16   DESIGNATED SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS.  The Obligations are hereby
designated by Borrowers as "Designated Senior Indebtedness", as defined in the
Indenture.

10.17   GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION.

(a)      THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS; PROVIDED THAT
THE AGENT AND THE BANKS SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

(b)      ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE
OF ILLINOIS OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, AND
BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF BORROWERS, THE AGENT AND
THE BANKS CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS.  EACH OF BORROWERS, THE AGENT AND
THE BANKS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE
LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY
NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH
JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO.
BORROWERS, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS EACH WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS,
COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY
ILLINOIS LAW.

10.18   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  BORROWERS, THE BANKS AND THE AGENT EACH
WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE
PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR
ASSIGNEE, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO






<PAGE>   56

CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE.  BORROWERS, THE BANKS AND THE AGENT
EACH AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER
AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF
THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN
WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF.  THIS WAIVER
SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

10.19   JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY.  Each Borrower hereby agrees that
such Borrower is jointly and severally liable for the full and prompt payment
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of,
all Obligations owed or hereafter owing to the Agent and the Banks by each
other Borrower.

10.20   ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, embodies the entire agreement and understanding among Borrowers, the
Banks and the Agent, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements and
understandings of such Persons, verbal or written, relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof.

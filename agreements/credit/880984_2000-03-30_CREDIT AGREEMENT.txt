Agreement"), the Bank made a loan to DSSI, the proceeds of which were used by

capital requirements of the Borrower.

herein set forth, to make a term loan to the Borrower in the principal amount of

SECTION 2.  FINANCING.

2.     Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Financing Agreements, the Bank hereby agrees to provide a
Credit Facility to the Borrower as follows:

2.1    Term Loan. Concurrently the Bank is making the Term Loan
to the Borrower in the principal amount of $6,000,000, The Term Loan will mature
on February 1, 2002 (the "Maturity Date"). The principal of the Term Loan may be
prepaid in whole or in part as provided in Section 2.3. Concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Borrower is evidencing its
obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the Term Loan by executing
and delivering a term note in the form of Exhibit A annexed (the "Note") to the
Bank in the principal sum of $6,000,000.

2.2    Interest.

2.2.1  LIBOR Rate.  Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Section 2.2, the Borrower shall pay interest to the Bank on the
outstanding and unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan at a rate per annum
equal to the LIBOR Rate plus three quarters of one percent (3/4%).

2.2.2  Availability.  The Bank shall, as soon as
practicable after 10:00 a.m., New York City time, two (2) Business Days prior to
the commencement of any Interest Period, determine the LIBOR Rate applicable to
the Term Loan and such LIBOR Rate shall be applicable


5
<PAGE>

to the Term Loan during such Interest Period. In the event the Bank shall have
determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Borrower) that dollar deposits in an amount approximately equal to the Term
Loan, with maturities comparable to the Interest Period, are not generally
available at such time in the London Interbank Market, or the rate at which such
dollar deposits are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to the Bank of making or maintaining a LIBOR Rate on the Term Loan or of
funding the same in the London Interbank Market during such Interest Period, or
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining a LIBOR Rate, or a LIBOR Rate on
the Term Loan would be in excess of the maximum interest rate which the Borrower
may by law be required to pay, the Bank shall so notify the Borrower and the
Term Loan shall, on the date that otherwise would have been the first date of
the Interest Period, and at all times thereafter until the Bank notifies the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist,
bear interest at a rate per annum equal the Reference Rate plus three quarters
of one percent (3/4%).

2.2.3  Calculation of Interest; Payment.  Interest on
the Term Loan shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a 360-day year and shall be due and payable on the last day of the
Interest Period with respect thereto. Whenever interest due on the Term Loan or
any portion thereof (as the case may be) shall be calculated by reference to the
Reference Rate, interest shall be due and payable on the outstanding principal
sum of the Term Loan or such portion (as the case may be) on the last day of
each month.

2.2.4  Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, if the Bank determines that any applicable law,
rule or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation
or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by the Bank with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall
make it unlawful or impossible for the Bank to maintain or fund loans at the
LIBOR Rate or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby, then
upon notice by the Bank to the Borrower, the Term Loan shall be automatically
converted to (and shall at all times thereafter, until the Bank notifies that
Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, remain as) a loan bearing
interest at the Reference Rate plus three quarters of one percent (3/4%), but in
no event in excess of the maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged to
the Borrower pursuant to applicable law.

2.2.5  Increased Cost.  The Borrower shall pay to the
Bank from time to time such amounts as the Bank may determine to be necessary to
compensate the Bank for any costs incurred by the Bank


6
<PAGE>

which the Bank determines are attributable to its making or maintaining any
loans at the LIBOR Rate hereunder, or any reduction in any amount receivable by
the Bank under this Agreement or the Note (such increases in costs and
reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"),
resulting from any change after the date of this Agreement in U.S. federal,
state, municipal, or foreign laws or regulations (including Regulation D), or
the adoption or making after such date of any interpretations, directives, or
requirements applying to a class of banks including the Bank of or under any
U.S. federal, state, municipal, or any foreign laws or regulations (whether or
not having the force of law) by any court or governmental or monetary authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof ("Regulatory Change"),
which: (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to the Bank
under this Agreement or the Note (other than taxes imposed on the overall net
income of the Bank for the Term Loan); or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve,
special deposit, compulsory loan, or similar requirements relating to any
extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other
liabilities of, the Bank (including the Term Loan or any deposits referred to in
the definition of LIBOR Rate; or iii) imposes any other condition affecting this
Agreement or the Note (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities). The
Bank will notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the date of this
Agreement which will entitle the Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section
2.2.5 as promptly as practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and
determines to request such compensation. Determinations by the Bank for purposes
of this Section 2.2.5 of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs of
making or maintaining loans based on the LIBOR Rate or on amounts receivable by
it in respect of the Term Loan, and of the additional amounts required to
compensate the Bank in respect of any Additional Costs, shall be conclusive,
provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis.

2.2.6  Overdue Payments.  If any payment of principal
(whether due at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise), interest or other
fees or charges payable by the Borrower hereunder, or under any of the Financing
Agreements, shall not be paid when due, the Borrower will pay interest on the
overdue payment for the period for which it is overdue, on demand, at the higher
of twelve percent (12%) or three percent (3%) per annum in excess of the then
interest rate otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, but in no event in
excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

2.3    Prepayment. The Borrower may, upon at least five (5)
Business Days' notice to the Bank, prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part,
with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid,
provided that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in a principal amount which
is not less than $250,000 and (ii) each prepayment shall be made only on the
last day of the Interest Period.


7
<PAGE>

The Borrower shall pay to the Bank, upon the request of the Bank, such amount or
amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Bank) to
compensate it for any loss, cost or expenses incurred as a result of any payment
on account of the Term Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest
Period including, but not limited to, acceleration of the Term Loan by the Bank
pursuant to Section 7.

2.4    Manner of Payments.  All payments required to be made
by the Borrower hereunder on account of principal, interest or fees shall be
made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds, at
the office of the Bank at 564 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10017 or at such
other place as the holder of the Note shall specify in writing. Whenever any
payment hereunder, or under any of the Financing Agreements, becomes due on a
day on which the Bank is closed (as required or permitted by law or otherwise),
such payment shall be made not later than the next succeeding business day of
the Bank, and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of
interest. The Borrower authorizes (but shall not require) the Bank to debit any
account maintained by the Borrower with the Bank, on any date on which a payment
is due hereunder or under any of the Financing Agree ments, in an amount equal
to any unpaid portion of such payment.

2.5    Security.

execution and delivery of this Agreement, DSSI is granting a valid perfected
first priority security interest to the Bank in the Cash Collateral to secure

Total Cost of such Asset Pool or such other amount as the Lender shall have indicated it would consider financing in any prior discussions with the Borrower related to such Asset Pool. Each such request for a Loan hereunder shall be in substantially

return to the Borrower of such Borrowing Request, and shall be subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement and such additional terms and conditions as the Lender may specify, and the Borrower may accept, in such accepted Borrowing Request
(each an “Accepted Borrowing Request”). An Accepted Borrowing Request delivered to the Borrower by the Lender shall constitute the Lender’s commitment, subject to satisfaction of all applicable terms and conditions of this
Agreement, to make a Loan to the Borrower to fund a specified percentage of the Total Cost of the Asset Pool, as set forth in such Accepted Borrowing Request; provided, however, that the Lender’s commitment to make a Loan to the
Borrower to finance the purchase of an Asset Pool shall not constitute a revolving commitment and the Borrower shall have no right to reborrow any amounts repaid to the Lender pursuant to an Accepted Borrowing Request; provided,
further, that to the extent an Accepted Borrowing Request relates to a forward flow contract, the Lender shall be required to provide Loans for all future purchases under such forward flow contract up to the total amount of the Loan approved
in such Accepted Borrowing Request without requiring any additional Borrowing Requests. An Accepted Borrowing Request shall expire and shall have no further force or effect if (i) the Borrower is not the successful bidder for the specified
Asset Pool at a purchase price which is not in excess of the anticipated purchase price described in such Borrowing Request, (ii) the Borrower does not consummate its purchase of such Asset Pool pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
related Purchase Agreement and as contemplated in the related Accepted Borrowing



10









Request within thirty (30) calendar days following issuance of the Accepted Borrowing Request by the Lender (unless (A) such period of time is
extended in writing by the Lender or (B) the Asset Pool Seller has unilaterally extended the closing date for purchase of an Asset Pool and the Borrower is unable to contest any such extension) or (iii) a Facility Default or Facility Event
of Default shall occur and shall be continuing under this Agreement.
(c) General Funding Procedures. The Borrower
shall provide the Lender with not less than five (5) Business Days prior written notice of the scheduled closing date for purchase of an Asset Pool described in an Accepted Borrowing Request and shall request funding of the related Loan on such
date (each a “Borrowing Date”). The Borrower shall fund its Asset Pool Contribution for the related Asset Pool by either of the following methods: (i) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Borrowing Date, the
Borrower shall transfer to the Lender the Borrower’s Asset Pool Contribution for the related Asset Pool, net of all Purchase Expenses paid or incurred by the Borrower, or (ii) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable
Borrowing Date, the Borrower shall transfer to the Asset Pool Seller the Borrower’s Asset Pool Contribution for the related Asset Pool, net of all Purchase Expenses paid or incurred by the Borrower. Upon receipt by the Lender of the
Borrower’s Asset Pool Contribution (if the funding method described in (i) above is used by the Borrower) or upon receipt by the Lender of a written acknowledgment from the Asset Pool Seller of its receipt and acceptance of the
Borrower’s Asset Pool Contribution (if the funding method described in (ii) above is used by the Borrower) and upon satisfaction of all applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, the Lender shall make a Loan to the Borrower
as specified in the related Accepted Borrowing Request by transferring the amount thereof, together with that portion of the Borrower’s Asset Pool Contribution received by the Lender (if the funding method described in (i) above is used by
the Borrower), to the Asset Pool Seller in purchase of the related Asset Pool on the designated Borrowing Date.
(d) Loan
Series and Asset Series. (i) Unless the Borrower and Lender agree otherwise in writing, each Loan shall be grouped together with other Loans made before it (if any) and collectively called a “Loan Series” until the earlier
of (A) December 31, 2008, and (B) the date that Lender directs Borrower to begin a new Loan Series.
(ii)
After the earlier of (i)(A) and (i)(B), each Loan made thereafter shall be grouped together with other Loans made following such date in a separate Loan Series until such additional Loan Series contains no fewer than three (3) Asset Pools and
the aggregate original principal amount of the Loans in the Loan Series equals or exceeds $10,000,000. If the aggregate original principal amount of Loans related to any one Asset Pool in a Loan Series is greater than 50% of the aggregate original
principal amount of the Loan Series, and the aggregate original principal amount of the Loans related to other Asset Pools in the Loan Series does not exceed $5,000,000, then additional Asset Pools must be added to such Loan Series until such time
as the aggregate original principal amount of all Loans related to other Asset Pools exceeds $5,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time, the Lender may direct the Borrower to begin a new Loan Series.


11








(iii) After each Loan Series is filled pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(i) or (ii),
the next Loan shall be the first Loan in a new Loan Series, and the procedure contemplated by Section 2.1(d)(ii) shall be completed in the same manner with respect to all future Loan Series.
(iv) All of the Asset Pools purchased with Loans in a Loan Series shall be grouped together and called an “Asset Series”.

Section 2.2 Obligation to Repay Loans; Issuance of Notes. In connection with the first Loan in a Loan Series made in any
calendar month, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Lender a promissory note in the face amount of the Loan, dated as of the Borrowing Date for such Loan and otherwise in substantially the form of Exhibit B. In connection with
each subsequent Loan in that same Loan Series made in that same calendar month, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Lender a promissory note with a face amount equal to the sum of the outstanding principal balance of all previous Loans
made in that calendar month plus the amount of the new Loan, as a replacement and consolidation of such previous Loans with the new Loan so that each such consolidation note evidences indebtedness in the aggregate outstanding amount of all Loan
advances in that Loan Series in that calendar month. Each such consolidation note shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit C and shall be issued in replacement of and substitution for, but not in payment of the previous promissory
notes issued in that Loan Series during that calendar month. Each note issued under this Section 2.2, whether the original note for a calendar month in a Loan Series or a consolidation note for a calendar month in a Loan Series, is
herein called a “Note”. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans evidenced by each Note shall bear interest, be payable and be secured as provided in such Note and herein.
Section 2.3 Interest on Loans. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance of each Loan for the Interest
Period commencing on the Borrowing Date for such Loan and for each Interest Period thereafter until such Loan is paid in full, in accordance with the following:
(a) The outstanding principal balance of each Loan shall bear interest at an annual rate at all times equal to the Floating Rate
applicable to such Loan.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, all agreements with respect to interest in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents between the Borrower and the Lender are hereby limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever shall the total liability for payments in the
nature of interest exceed the applicable limits imposed by any applicable usury laws. If any payments in the nature of interest made under this Agreement or any other Loan Document are held to be in excess of the limits imposed by any applicable
usury laws, it is agreed that any such amount held to be in excess shall be considered payment of principal in respect of the applicable Loan, and the aggregate indebtedness under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be reduced by such
amount so that the total liability for payments in the nature of interest shall not exceed the applicable limits imposed by any applicable usury laws, in compliance with the desires of the Borrower and the Lender.


12








Section 2.4 Computation and Payment of Interest on Loans. Interest accruing on each Note
shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of three hundred and sixty-five (365) days. If Asset Series Proceeds received during a Collection Period and available to pay interest on Notes evidencing Loans of a
given Loan Series on a given Distribution Date in accordance with Section 2.8 are sufficient to pay in full interest on such Notes accruing during the Interest Period ending on such Distribution Date, the amount of such accrued interest
shall be due and payable in arrears on such Distribution Date for the related Asset Series; otherwise, any deficiency between the Asset Series Proceeds available to pay such interest on such Distribution Date and the amount of such interest due and
payable on such Distribution Date shall be capitalized by increasing the outstanding principal balance of the deficient Note in such Loan Series by such deficiency amount, provided that if doing so would cause the outstanding principal balance of a
Note to exceed the face amount of a Note, upon request of the Lender, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Lender a replacement Note in a face amount equal to such outstanding principal balance.
Section 2.5 Payment of Principal and Interest on Loans. Interest accruing on the indebtedness evidenced by a Note in a Loan Series shall be
payable in arrears on the next occurring Distribution Date, but only to the extent available in accordance with Section 2.8. If not paid in full on a Distribution Date, all accrued and unpaid interest on a Note in a Loan Series shall be
capitalized as of such date in accordance with Section 2.4. Principal of each Note in a Loan Series shall be finally due and payable on the Loan Maturity Date for such Note to the extent available in accordance with
Section 2.8. In addition, each Note in a Loan Series shall be subject to mandatory prepayment on each Distribution Date for the related Asset Series in an amount equal to the Asset Series Proceeds available for such prepayment on such
date, as provided in Section 2.8. The Borrower may prepay each Note in a Loan Series, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty; provided, however, that any such prepayment can only
be made from Asset Series Proceeds (including, for purposes of this Section 2.5, any Permitted Cure Funds or Special Capital Contributions with respect to such Asset Series) received with respect to the Asset Series for such Loan Series and not
with any other proceeds or funds from any other source, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Lender.
Section 2.6 Transfer
or Assignment of Loans. Each Note evidencing a Loan shall contain the following provisions restricting the transferability of such Note and the Lender’s rights to receive payments thereunder: “This Note shall not be transferred without
compliance with Section 9.12 hereof and providing written notice of the transfer and the identity of the transferee to the Borrower, which shall be in the form of a true and correct copy of the original endorsement of this Note provided
to the Borrower in accordance with the notice provisions of the Credit Agreement. Any transfer without compliance with the previous sentence shall be null and void.” In the event that a Note is issued that does not contain this language, the
provisions of this Section 2.6 shall be deemed to govern and apply to such Note as if such language were contained therein.
Section 2.7 Collection and Deposit of Asset Series Proceeds. Except as provided in Sections 8.6 and 8.7, the Notes in each Loan Series shall be paid out of Asset Series Proceeds collected with respect to the
related Asset Series. The Borrower shall cause all Asset Series Proceeds received by the Servicer or the Borrower (net of the Servicing Fees earned and



13









unpaid and Advanced Court Costs actually incurred by the Servicer and not previously reimbursed with respect to such Asset Series) to be directly deposited,
before the end of the next Business Day following the date of receipt by Servicer, to a separate Collateral Account for the Asset Series opened and maintained by the Collateral Agent, in the name of and under the sole control of the Lender, pursuant
to the Collateral Account Agreement (each, a “Collateral Account”). The Borrower will not and will not permit the Servicer to commingle any Asset Series Proceeds collected with respect to the various Asset Series with any moneys or
other funds that are not Asset Series Proceeds. Each Collateral Account shall be an interest bearing account and all interest earned on amounts on deposit therein shall constitute, and be treated as, Asset Series Proceeds collected with respect to
the applicable Asset Series. All Asset Series Proceeds so deposited shall be held in the applicable Collateral Account until the next occurring Distribution Date. Not later than 3:00 p.m., Chicago, Illinois time, on the Business Day preceding each
Distribution Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the Lender a report for the preceding Collection Period setting forth, by Note, the Asset Series Proceeds, Servicing Fees, Advanced Court Costs, outstanding balances of the Notes in each Loan Series
and other relevant information (which may include without limitation documentation requested by the Lender to support the Servicer’s withholding of Advanced Court Costs) to determine the use and application of the Asset Series Proceeds that are
(i) deposited to the Collateral Accounts, or (ii) withheld from deposit by the Servicer in accordance with this Section 2.7, during such Collection Period (each, a “Distribution Report”). The Lender will make
its determinations as to distributions in accordance with Section 2.8. In no event shall any Asset Series Proceeds be withdrawn from any Collateral Account without the prior written consent of the Lender as to each such withdrawal or
transfer.
Section 2.8 Distribution of Asset Series Proceeds. Upon delivery to the Collateral Agent of the Lender’s
written authorization for distributions to be made from the Collateral Accounts as contemplated in Section 2.7, Asset Series Proceeds (including, for purposes of Section 2.8 (but not Sections 2.8(b) or 2.8(c)), all Special Capital
Contributions with respect to such Asset Series) on deposit in the applicable Collateral Account with respect to each Note in the Loan Series shall be distributed on the next succeeding Distribution Date for such Note, in accordance with the
following:
(a) first, (x) to the Lender, an amount equal to all unpaid Loan Costs paid or incurred by the
Lender with respect to the making or collection of the Loans in a Loan Series related to such Asset Series and (y) to the Borrower the amount required to be distributed to the members of Borrower pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(i) of the
Operating Agreement;
(b) second, to the Servicer, for any given Account, an amount equal to the Advanced Court Costs
with respect to such Account; provided, however, that (i) no payments shall be made pursuant to this subparagraph to the extent that such amounts have previously been withheld by the Servicer from Asset Series Proceeds deposited
into the Collateral Account pursuant to Section 2.7, and (ii) no proceeds of any Special Capital Contributions received by Borrower shall be used to pay any amounts due to the Servicer pursuant to this Section 2.8(b);



14








(c) third, to the Servicer, an amount equal to the Servicing Fee, if any, payable
to the Servicer with respect to such Asset Series Proceeds; provided, however, that (i) no payments shall be made pursuant to this subparagraph to the extent that such amounts have previously been withheld by the Servicer from
Asset Series Proceeds deposited into the Collateral Account pursuant to Section 2.7, (ii) no proceeds of any Special Capital Contributions received by Borrower shall be used to pay any amounts due to the Servicer pursuant to this
Section 2.8(c), and (iii) to the extent Servicing Fees are reduced pursuant to Section 2.9(b), the Servicing Fees shall be payable at such reduced amount until the conditions for payment of the Subordinated Servicing Fee
Amount in Section 2.9 (b)(i) or (ii) shall have been satisfied, in which case such Subordinated Servicing Fee Amount shall be payable pursuant to this Section 2.8(c);
(d) fourth, to the Lender, an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid interest on each Note in the Loan Series;
(e) fifth, to the Lender, an amount equal to the outstanding principal of each Note in the Loan Series, until such Note shall have
been paid in full; and
(f) sixth, to the Borrower, the remainder of the Asset Series Proceeds with respect to each
Note in the Loan Series for distribution in accordance with the Operating Agreement.
Section 2.9 75% Test. (a) With
respect to each Asset Series, the Borrower and the Lender contemplate that from and after the date which is the six (6) month anniversary of the Borrowing Date for the initial Loan related to such Asset Series, the Asset Series Proceeds
(including, for purposes of this Section 2.9, the aggregate amount of all Permitted Cure Funds and Special Capital Contributions with respect to such Asset Series) actually received with respect to such Asset Series, on a cumulative basis, will
always be, as of any date of determination, at least seventy-five percent (75%) of Asset Series Proceeds projected by the Borrower to be received with respect to such Asset Series in the bid packages submitted by the Borrower as part of the
Accepted Borrowing Requests for such Asset Series (the “75% Test”). The Borrower agrees to provide, or to cause the Servicer to provide, to the Lender, a report, as of the end of each calendar quarter, in form and content acceptable
to the Lender (the “75% Test Report”), which shall establish, with respect to each Asset Series, whether such Asset Series is in compliance with the 75% Test as of the end of such calendar quarter. In the event that any Asset Series
fails at any time to comply with the 75% Test, then the Lender, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to (i) appoint a replacement independent third-party servicer to service such Asset Series; provided, that, such independent
third-party servicer shall not service any Assets in such Asset Series that are subject to bona fide payment arrangements or (ii) instruct Borrower to seek sale of all or a portion of the Asset Series by providing notice thereof within 5
Business Days of the applicable 75% Test Report, in which case Borrower shall use its reasonable best efforts to sell such portion of the Asset Series as Lender may request on commercially reasonable terms. Upon notice from the Lender of the
Lender’s determination to appoint a replacement servicer with respect to such Asset Series, the Borrower and the Servicer shall cooperate with the Lender in effecting such transfer of servicing responsibilities by, among other things,
delivering to the Lender or such replacement servicer, as directed by the Lender, such information and other items as the Lender or such replacement servicer deems necessary. If requested by Lender, Borrower



15









and Servicer shall join with the Lender and such replacement servicer in the execution and delivery of a servicing agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Lender and such replacement servicer and such other documentation as the Lender shall reasonably require. All costs and expenses incurred by the Borrower and the Servicer in complying with their obligations under this Section 2.9 shall
be for their own respective accounts and shall not be reimbursed by the Lender or from Asset Series Proceeds. All costs incurred by the Lender in connection with this Section 2.9 shall constitute Loan Costs to the extent such costs have
been actually incurred and arise out of charges from third parties (as opposed to expenses charged by the Lender), are reasonable, and such Loan Costs shall be payable as provided in this Agreement solely from Asset Series Proceeds arising out of
the applicable Asset Series. All Asset Series Proceeds collected by such replacement servicer shall be deposited into the applicable Collateral Account for distribution in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, except that with respect to
the Assets placed with such replacement servicer, a reasonable and customary servicing fee under the circumstances shall be payable to such replacement servicer in accordance with the servicing agreement entered into with such replacement servicer
(in the same order of priority as the Servicing Fee would have been paid to the Servicer absent such transfer) and no Servicing Fee or any other amount shall be payable to the Servicer with respect to such Assets placed with such replacement
servicer. Nothing in this Section 2.9(a) shall be deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies available to the Lender as a result of the occurrence of a Loan Series Default or a Loan Series Event of Default under this Agreement.

(b) In addition to Lender’s right to designate a replacement servicer pursuant to Section 2.9(a), in the event that any
Asset Series fails at any time to comply with the 75% Test, then, for so long as such Asset Series continues to fail the 75% Test, the Servicing Fee otherwise payable with respect to such Asset Series shall be reduced to the extent such Servicing
Fee exceeds Servicer’s Total Direct Costs. “Total Direct Costs” means all direct costs incurred in connection with a particular Asset Series, including court costs, media costs, third-party servicing fees, costs to manage
third-party servicing efforts and costs incurred in respect of internal collection efforts (including salaries, commissions and benefits of collection personnel and an allocation for the costs of facilities, telecommunications and incidental
expenses related to the applicable collection activities), but excluding an allocation for general management overhead expenses. To the extent the Servicing Fee is reduced pursuant to this Section 2.9(b), the amount of such reduction (the
“Subordinated Servicing Fee Amount”) shall be payable to Servicer out of the applicable Asset Series Proceeds upon the earlier to occur of (i) the applicable Asset Series satisfying the 75% Test and (ii) final payment by
Borrower of all principal and interest due in respect of the applicable Loan Series.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, the failure of an Asset Series to comply with the 75% Test shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under this Agreement. However, the failure of the Borrower or the Servicer to cooperate with the
Lender in transferring servicing responsibilities to a replacement servicer following the failure of an Asset Series to comply with the 75% Test or to use reasonable best efforts to sell a requested portion of the Asset Series as required by
Section 2.9(a) shall constitute a Loan Series Event of Default under this Agreement.

ARTICLE III
COLLATERAL FOR LOANS; CUSTODY, SERVICING AND COLLECTIONS
Section 3.1 Pledge of Asset Pool
Collateral. To secure the due and prompt payment and performance of the Obligations with respect to a given Loan Series, the Borrower shall grant the Lender a lien on and pledge of the Loan Collateral related to such Loan Series. The Loan
Collateral related to a given Loan Series shall only secure the Obligations related to the given Loan Series and shall not secure any Obligations with respect to any other Loan Series; provided, that, upon the occurrence of a Facility
Event of Default, Loan Collateral related to a given Loan Series shall secure the Obligations related to such Loan Series and the Obligations related to each and every other Loan Series all as further set forth in the Security Agreement.

Section 3.2 Perfection of Security Interests in Personal Property Collateral. The Borrower agrees to deliver to the Lender (or its
designated custodial agent), promptly upon the Lender’s request and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Lender’s request, copies of each original Account file of or relating to any Account and originals of each
promissory note, chattel paper, installment sales agreement or other instrument with respect to which perfection may be obtained by possession, and shall execute such financing statements, together with any and all other instruments, assignments or
documents and take such other actions as may be required, to perfect and to continue the perfection of the Lender’s security interest in all Loan Collateral.
Section 3.3 Servicing of Assets. The Borrower shall be obligated to manage, service, administer, make collections and pursue enforcement proceedings with respect to each Asset in accordance with the
customary and usual procedures of institutions which service assets of the type included in each Asset Series and in substantial accordance with a written servicing plan delivered to, and approved by, the Lender (the “Servicing
Plan”). The Servicer shall not make any material changes to the Servicing Plan without the prior written consent of the Lender, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. In satisfaction of its servicing obligations under this Agreement,
the Borrower has entered into a Servicing Agreement by and among the Servicer, the Lender and the Borrower of even date herewith (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Servicing Agreement”).
Immediately upon the occurrence of a Loan Series Termination Event or a Facility Termination Event (as each such term is defined in the Servicing Agreement) the Lender may, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Servicing Agreement,
terminate the Servicer then acting in such capacity under the Servicing Agreement and may appoint a replacement servicer selected by the Lender in its reasonable discretion, and enter into a replacement servicing agreement acceptable to the Lender
in its reasonable discretion. The Lender will endeavor to notify the Servicer of the replacement servicer selected and the fee for which such replacement servicer will service the Assets transferred to it by reason of the applicable Termination
Event (as defined in the Servicing Agreement).


17








Section 3.4 Authority to Settle or Sell Loan Collateral. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower may and the Borrower may instruct the Servicer to:
(a) settle Loan
Collateral with an Obligor (a “Settlement”) if:
(i) the Settlement constitutes an arms length transaction
in compliance with Section 6.8 hereof (provided, that, such Section shall not prohibit payment of the otherwise applicable Servicing Fee);
(ii) the Settlement does not result in receipt by the Borrower, the Servicer or any Affiliated Party of any commission, fee or other compensation in violation of Section 7.6 hereof (provided, that, such
Section shall not prohibit payment of the otherwise applicable Servicing Fee, or any other commission, fee, or other compensation approved in writing by the Lender); and
(iii) the Settlement results in the realization (prior to payment of any applicable Servicing Fee) of not less than two and one-half times
(2.5x) the purchase price paid by the Borrower under the applicable Purchase Agreement for the Loan Collateral subject to the Settlement.
(b) sell, assign or otherwise transfer, by or through any wholly owned Affiliated Party of West Corporation, Accounts from more than one Obligor to any other Person (a “Bulk Transfer”) if:

(i) the Bulk Transfer constitutes an arms length transaction in compliance with Section 6.8 hereof (provided, that, such
Section shall not prohibit payment of the sales fee described below in Section 3.4(b)(iv));
(ii) the Bulk
Transfer does not result in receipt by the Borrower, the Servicer or any Affiliated Party of any commission, fee or other compensation in violation of Section 7.6 hereof (provided, that, such Section shall not prohibit payment of the
sales fee described below in Section 3.4(b)(iv));
(iii) the Bulk Transfer is consummated with Lender first
having been given notice of the opportunity to bid on the applicable Loan Collateral (it being agreed that until notified in writing by Lender that it has an interest in bidding on Loan Collateral, no such opportunity to bid shall be required to
satisfy this clause (iii), and, following such notice, such opportunity shall be on terms as to timeline and availability of information as shall be reasonably agreed between Borrower and Lender); and
(iv) no Servicing Fee shall be payable in connection with such Bulk Transfer and the Servicer shall be entitled to a sales fee not to
exceed the lesser of one percent (1%) of amounts received as a result of the Bulk Transfer or its actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Bulk Transfer in lieu of any otherwise applicable Servicing Fee.
Any amounts received on account of any Settlement or Bulk Transfer in accordance with this Section shall constitute Asset Series Proceeds and, after payment to the
Servicer of the sales fee described in Section 3.4(b)(iv), shall be deposited into the applicable Collateral Account and disbursed in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.8 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt,



18









this Section 3.4 shall not be interpreted as a prohibition on the taking of any action (whether or not Borrower complies with conditions (b)(i) through
(iv)) by Borrower with respect to a Bulk Transfer not otherwise prohibited by Section 7.2.
Section 3.5 Exchange of
Assets with Asset Pool Sellers. In the event that the Borrower shall exchange or return Assets with any Asset Pool Seller, the Borrower shall promptly notify the Lender of such exchange or return and shall provide such information with respect
to such exchange or return as Lender shall reasonably require. The Servicer shall not be entitled to any Servicing Fee with respect to any such exchange or return.

ARTICLE V
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender as of the date

MISCELLANEOUS
Section 9.1 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure or delay on the part of the Lender in
exercising any right, power or remedy under the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy under the Loan Documents. The remedies provided in the Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
Section 9.2 Amendments, Requested Waivers, Etc. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Lender. Any waiver or consent given hereunder shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in
any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

34









provision of law which prohibits or renders void or unenforceable any provision hereof. If the invalidity of any part, provision, representation or warranty
of this Agreement shall deprive any party of the economic benefit intended to be conferred by this Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to develop a structure the economic effect of which is as nearly as possible the same as the
economic effect of this Agreement without regard to such invalidity.

Section 9.5 Reimbursement of the Lender’s Costs and Expenses.
(a) Out-of-Pocket Costs and Expenses Incurred in Connection with the Preparation, Execution and Delivery of the Loan Documents. The
Borrower and the Lender agree that all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Lender and the Borrower in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents (including without limitation reasonable legal fees and
expenses of counsel), UCC searches, recording fees, and other similar expenses paid or incurred by the Lender in connection with obtaining and perfecting its security interest or lien on or priority in any Loan Collateral shall be paid by the
Borrower.
(b) Out-of-Pocket Costs and Expenses Incurred by the Lender in Connection with Administering, Amending,
Documenting, Recording, Filing, Insuring or Enforcing the Loan Documents or the Loan Collateral after Funding. All out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Lender in connection with administering, amending, documenting, recording,
filing, insuring or enforcing any Loan Document or any Loan Collateral, or perfecting or maintaining the priority of any lien on or security interest in any Loan Collateral, incurred after funding of the related Loan shall constitute Loan Costs with
respect to the related Asset Series for which they were incurred (or pro rata among all Asset Series if not attributable to one such Asset Series) and shall be payable as such in accordance with Section 2.8 or Section 8.6, as
applicable. In furtherance of the foregoing, and not in limitation thereof, the Lender and the Borrower agree that all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Lender in connection with the enforcement by the Lender of any of the rights or
remedies available to the Lender under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents or under applicable law, whether or not suit is filed with respect thereto, shall constitute Loan Costs which shall be payable as such in accordance with
Section 2.8 or Section 8.6, as applicable.


36








Section 9.6 Indemnity. In addition to the payment of out-of-pocket costs and expenses
pursuant to Section 9.5, the Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Lender and each of its respective participants, parent corporations, subsidiary corporations, affiliated corporations, successor corporations, and
all present and future officers, directors, employees and agents (the “Indemnitees”), from and against (i) to the extent not included as Purchase Expenses, any and all transfer taxes, documentary taxes, assessments or charges
made by any governmental authority by reason of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or the making of any Loans, and (ii) any and all liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits, claims, costs
and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitations, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel actually incurred) in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceedings, whether or not such
Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto, which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of or in connection with, the making of any Loans or entering into this Agreement or
any other Loan Documents or the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loans or the collection of Assets, excepting, however, from the foregoing any such liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, suits, claims, costs and expenses
resulting from collection actions undertaken by the Lender, or by a replacement servicer appointed by the Lender, or the willful misconduct or gross negligence of an Indemnitee. If any investigative, judicial or administrative proceeding arising
from any of the foregoing is brought against any Indemnitee, upon request of such Indemnitee, the Borrower, or counsel designated by the Borrower and satisfactory to the Indemnitee, will resist and defend such action, suit or proceeding to the
extent and in the manner directed by the Indemnitee, at the Borrower’s sole cost and expense. Each Indemnitee will use its best efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding. If the foregoing undertaking to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless may be held to be unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, the Borrower shall nevertheless make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified liabilities
contemplated hereby which is permissible under applicable law. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
Section 9.7 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement and other Loan Documents may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
when so executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
Section 9.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
(a) Governing
Law. Except as otherwise provided in the Security Agreement, the Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Nebraska.
(b) Jurisdiction. The Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court sitting in Douglas
County, Nebraska, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such federal court. The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an



37









inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding. The Borrower irrevocably consents to the service of copies of the summons and complaint
and any other process which may be served in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Borrower at its addresses specified in Section 9.4 above. The
Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Section 9.8(b) shall
affect the right of either party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or affect the right of either party to bring any action or proceeding against the other party or its property in the courts of other jurisdictions.

(c) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER AND THE LENDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY INSTRUMENT OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED THEREUNDER.
Section 9.9 Integration. This Agreement comprises the final and complete integration of all prior expressions by the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to such subject matter, superseding all prior oral or written understandings.
Section 9.10 Agreement
Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective upon delivery of fully executed counterparts hereof to each of the parties hereto.
Section 9.11 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 9.12 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Borrower and the Lender and their respective successors and
assigns, except that neither the Borrower nor the Lender may transfer or assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to compliance with Section 2.6 thereof, the
Lender hereby expressly reserves unto itself the right to sell, transfer, assign and convey any Note or any portion thereof and any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or with respect to any Loan or Note, including without
limitation the right to sell undivided participating interests in any Loan or Note, to its Lender Affiliates, or any purchaser of its ownership interest in the Borrower pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement permitted pursuant to the Operating
Agreement, without any prior notice to or consent of the Borrower. In addition, the Lender hereby expressly reserves unto itself the right to sell undivided participating interests in any or all of the Loans and related Notes, without prior notice
to or consent of the Borrower; provided, that, such sales of participating interests shall not restrict or provide for a transfer or change of decision-making control with respect to the administration and enforcement of this Agreement except in the
event of a default by a Lender under the participation interest sale agreement. The Lender may provide to any potential assignees or transferees copies of all Loan Documents and other information regarding any Asset Pool or the Borrower that the
Lender may then have in its possession, provided that any such potential assignee or transferee shall agree to keep such information confidential.


38








Section 9.13 Advice from Independent Counsel. The parties hereto understand that this
Agreement is a legally binding agreement that may affect such party’s rights. Each party hereto represents to the other that it has received legal advice from counsel of its choice regarding the meaning and legal significance of this Agreement
and that it is satisfied with its legal counsel and the advice received from it.
Section 9.14 Judicial Interpretation. Should
any provision of this Agreement require judicial interpretation, it is agreed that a court interpreting or construing the same shall not apply a presumption that the terms hereof shall be more strictly construed against any person by reason of the
rule of construction that a document is to be construed more strictly against the person who itself or through its agent prepared the same, it being agreed that all parties hereto have participated in the preparation of this Agreement.

Section 9.15 Use of Lender’s Name. The Borrower hereby agrees that neither the Borrower nor the Servicer shall refer to or use the
name “TOGM”, or any such name in any manner in any collection or enforcement activities with respect to any Asset or in any advertising, printed material, electronic medium or other medium, without first obtaining the Lender’s prior
written consent. The Lender shall have no obligation to give any such written consent and may withhold the same in its sole and absolute discretion.
Section 9.16 Confidentiality of Information. The Lender hereby acknowledges that it will use all information regarding one or more Asset Pools in connection with a Borrowing Request (the
“Confidential Information”) solely for the purposes of evaluating, administering and enforcing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and making any necessary business judgments with respect thereto and, in particular,
determining whether or not to make a Loan with respect to an Asset Pool. In addition, the Lender will not disclose any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Borrower, other than to the directors, employees, auditors,
counsel or affiliates of the Lender, each of whom shall be informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; provided, however, that the Lender or Borrower may disclose any such Confidential Information (i) to
any party contemplated in this Agreement for purposes contemplated hereunder (including to any permitted assignee of a Loan), (ii) as may be required by any municipal, state, federal or other regulatory body having or claiming to have
jurisdiction over such party, (iii) in order to comply with any law, order, regulation, regulatory request or ruling applicable to such party or (iv) in the event any such party is legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for
information or copies, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such Confidential Information; provided, further, that, the Lender will endeavor to give notice to the Borrower of any required disclosure under (ii),
(iii) and (iv) above prior to such disclosure. This Section 9.16 shall be inoperative as to those portions of the Confidential Information which are or become generally available to the public or to the Lender on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or were known to the Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Borrower.


39








Section 9.17 Effective Date. This Credit Agreement shall be effective as of the date on which
Lender acquires a membership interest in the Borrower pursuant to the Operating Agreement.


40








IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their respective
officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first above written.

anticipate that the Total Cost of the Asset Pool (which includes anticipated Purchase Expenses) will be $            , as set forth and described in Annex II attached hereto.
The terms and conditions of any deferred amounts payable to the Asset Pool Seller are as set forth and described in Annex II attached hereto.
Pursuant to Section 2.1 of the Credit Agreement, we hereby request that you make a Loan in an amount not to exceed the lesser of (i) ____________ percent (_____%) of the Total Cost of the Asset Pool
or (ii) $            . Our Asset Pool Contribution with respect to the Asset Pool will be $            , which
is not less than twenty percent (20%) of the Total Cost of the Asset Pool. The Floating Rate applicable to the Loan will be equal to the sum of (a) the Base Rate and (b) _________ percent (____%).
The Loan [will be included in the Loan Series and Asset Series designated _______________ will commence a new Loan Series and Asset Series to be known as

Our good faith estimate of actual incremental servicing costs over time with respect to the Asset Pool
which supports a requested Servicing Fee as follow:

The Company has previously issued $600,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its 7.125% Senior Notes due 2023 under the Indenture (the “Existing Notes”). The Notes offered hereby constitute an additional issuance of Securities under the Indenture. The Notes will have identical terms to the Existing Notes and will be treated as a single class of securities with the Existing Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.







The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the Securities, as follows:

The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the “Securities Act”), an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-181299), including a prospectus, relating to the Company’s debt securities. Such registration statement, at the time it became effective, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness (“Rule 430 Information”), is referred to herein as the “Registration Statement”; and as used herein, the term “Preliminary Prospectus” means any preliminary prospectus relating to the offering of the Securities, including any preliminary prospectus supplement thereto relating to the Securities filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) under the Securities Act and the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time of its effectiveness that omits Rule 430 Information, and the term “Prospectus” means the final prospectus and any final prospectus supplement in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Securities. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be and any reference to “amend”, “amendment” or “supplement” with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the “Exchange Act”) that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.


































At or prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made (the “Time of Sale”), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively, the “Time of Sale Information”): a Preliminary Prospectus dated September 24, 2012, and each “free-writing prospectus” (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed on Annex B hereto as constituting part of the Time of Sale Information.

14


















(e)           Time of Sale Information. If at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Information as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Information to comply with law, the Company will immediately notify the Underwriters thereof and forthwith prepare and, subject to paragraph (c) above, file with the Commission (to the extent required) and furnish to the Underwriters and to such dealers as the Representative may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Information as may be necessary so that the statements in the Time of Sale Information as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Information will comply with law.







(f)           Ongoing Compliance. If during the Prospectus Delivery Period (i) any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with law, the Company will immediately notify the Underwriters thereof and forthwith prepare and, subject to paragraph (c) above, file with the Commission and furnish to the Underwriters and to such dealers as the Representative may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Prospectus as may be necessary so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances existing when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus will comply with law.







(g)           Blue Sky Compliance. The Company will qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative shall reasonably request and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for distribution of the Securities; provided that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation or other entity or as a dealer in securities in any such jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to so qualify, (ii) file any general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not otherwise so subject.

15


















(i)           Clear Market. The Company will not for a period of 30 days following the Time of Sale, without the prior written consent of the Representative offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, otherwise dispose of, or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering, of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company (other than the Securities).







(j)           Use of Proceeds. The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus under the heading “Use of Proceeds”.

5.           Certain Agreements of the Underwriters.   Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that







(a) It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any “free writing prospectus”, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) a free writing prospectus that, solely as a result of use by such Underwriter, would not trigger an obligation to file such free writing prospectus with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433, (ii) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Annex B or prepared pursuant to Section 3(c) or Section 4(c) above (including any electronic road show), or (iii) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing (each such free writing prospectus referred to in clauses (i) or (iii), an “Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Underwriters may use a term sheet substantially in the form of Annex C hereto without the consent of the Company.















16


















(b) It is not subject to any pending proceeding under Section 8A of the Securities Act with respect to the offering (and will promptly notify the Company if any such proceeding against it is initiated during the Prospectus Delivery Period).







(c) In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a “Relevant Member State”), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the “Relevant Implementation Date”) it has not made and will not make an offer of the Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Securities which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of the Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State:









(i)


to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;












(ii)


to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors, as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the Representative for any such offer; or












(iii)


in any other circumstances falling within article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive;










provided that no such offer of the Securities shall result in a requirement for the publication by the Company or the Representative of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive.





For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Securities to the public” in relation to any Securities in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Securities, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State and the expression “2010 PD Amending Directive” means Directive 2010/73/EU.













17


















(d) It has only communicated and caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”)) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Securities in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Company.





(e) It has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Securities in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

7.           Indemnification and Contribution.







(a)           Indemnification of the Underwriters. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its selling agents, affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.















20


















(b)           Indemnification of the Company.  Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the third, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth paragraphs in the section entitled “Underwriting” in the Prospectus.







(c)           Notice and Procedures. If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the “Indemnified Person”) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the “Indemnifying Person”) in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as reasonably incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its selling agents, affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could reasonably have been expected to become a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.















21


















(d)           Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.















22


















(e)           Limitation on Liability. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.







(f)           Non-Exclusive Remedies. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.







8.           Effectiveness of Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.







9.           Termination. This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.















23


















10.           Defaulting Underwriter. (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term “Underwriter” includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.







(b)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.







(c)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.















24


















(d)           Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.







11.           Payment of Expenses. (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); and (viii) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any “road show” presentation to potential investors.







(b)           If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.







12.           Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the selling agents and affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.















25


















13.           Survival. The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties, agreements and other statements of the Company or its officers and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or its officers or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters or any of the Indemnified Persons referred to in Section 7 hereof.







14.           Certain Defined Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) except where otherwise expressly provided, the term "affiliate" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; (b) the term "business day" means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City and (c) the term "subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.







15.           Miscellaneous. (a) Authority of the Representative. Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may be taken by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC shall be binding upon the Underwriters.

Annex A-1












Jones Day shall have furnished to the Representative its written opinion, as counsel to the Company, addressed to the Representative and dated the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representative, to the effect that:







1.


The Company is a corporation existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.












2.


The Underwriting Agreement has been authorized by all necessary corporate action of, and executed and delivered by, the Company.












3.


The Indenture has been authorized by all necessary corporate action of, and executed and delivered by, the Company and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.












4.


The Securities have been authorized by all necessary corporate action of, and executed by, the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will have been validly issued and delivered by the Company and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.












5.


No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture by the Company, or in connection with the issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company to the Underwriters, except (i) such as may be required under state securities or “blue sky” laws, (ii) such as have been obtained or made under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) or the Trust Indenture Act (“the Trust Indenture Act”) or (iii) reporting obligations under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the rules and regulations thereunder.












6.


The (i) execution, delivery and performance of (A) the Indenture by the Company and (B) the Underwriting Agreement by the Company, (ii) issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company and (iii) compliance with the terms and provisions thereof by the Company will not violate any law or regulation known to us to be generally applicable to transactions of this type (other than federal or state securities or “blue sky” laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph), or any order or decree of any court, arbitrator or governmental agency that is binding upon the Company or its properties or violate or result in a default under any of the terms and provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, as amended, or any agreement to which the Company is a party or bound (this opinion being limited (x) to those orders and decrees identified on Exhibit A attached hereto and to those agreements identified on Exhibit B attached hereto, and (y) in that we express no opinion with respect to any violation of or default (1) not readily ascertainable from the face of any such order, decree or agreement, (2) arising under or based upon any cross-default provision insofar as it relates to a violation or default under an agreement not identified on Exhibit B attached hereto, or (3) arising as a result of any violation of or default under any agreement or covenant by failure to comply with any financial or numerical requirement requiring computation).


















31




















7.


The Company is not and, solely after giving effect to the offer and sale of the Securities and the application of the net proceeds from such sale as described under the caption “Use of Proceeds” in the Final Prospectus (as defined below), will not be, required to register as an “investment company,” as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.












8.


The statements contained in the Time of Sale Information (as defined below) and the Final Prospectus under the captions “Description of the Notes,” “Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” and “Benefit Plan Investor Considerations,” insofar as such statements purport to summarize legal matters or provisions of documents referred to therein, present fair summaries of such legal matters and documents in all material respects.










We have participated in the preparation of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-181299) (the “Registration Statement”), the Prospectus dated May 10, 2012 (the “Base Prospectus”), the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated September 24, 2012 (together with the Base Prospectus, the “Preliminary Prospectus”), the information identified on the Term Sheet in the form of Annex C to the Underwriting Agreement (together with the Preliminary Prospectus, the “Time of Sale Information”) and the Prospectus Supplement dated September 24, 2012 (together with the Base Prospectus, the “Final Prospectus”) (the Exchange Act Documents (as defined below) having previously been prepared and filed by the Company without our participation).  Each of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus includes the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act (collectively, the “Exchange Act Documents”).  From time to time, we have had discussions with certain officers, directors and employees of the Company, with representatives of KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who examined the financial statements of the Company incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus, with representatives of Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who examined the financial statements of Verizon’s Separate Telephone Operations incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus, with the Underwriters and with counsel to the Underwriters concerning the information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and the proposed responses to various items in Form S-3.  Based on our participation and discussions described above, we are of the view that the Registration Statement (including all information deemed to be part of and included therein pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act), as of September 24, 2012, which is the date you have identified as the earlier of the date the Final Prospectus was first used or the date of the first contract of sale of the Securities (such date, the “Effective Date”), and the Final Prospectus, as of its date, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) thereunder, except that we express no view with respect to (i) the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or (ii) the information referred to under the caption “Experts” as having been included or incorporated by reference therein on the authority of KPMG LLP or Ernst & Young LLP, as experts.













32


















We have not independently verified and are not passing upon, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness (except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph 8 above) of the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus.  Based on our participation and discussions described above, however, no facts have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Registration Statement (including all information deemed to be part of and included therein pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act), as of the Effective Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, as of 2:15 p.m. (New York City time) on September 24, 2012 (which is the time that you have informed us was prior to the first contract of sale of any Securities by the Underwriters), included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Final Prospectus, as of its date or on the date hereof, included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that we express no view with respect to (i) the financial statements, financial schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or (ii) the information referred to under the caption “Experts” as having been included or incorporated by reference therein on the authority of KPMG LLP or Ernst & Young LLP, as experts.





The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose are pending or threatened by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.

Annex A-2

















October 1, 2012





CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC


As Representative of the several Underwriters


named in Schedule 1 to the Underwriting


Agreement referred to below


c/o  CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC


Eleven Madison Avenue


New York, New York 10010





Ladies and Gentlemen:





I am Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Frontier Communications Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”).  In connection with the Underwriting Agreement dated September 24, 2012 (the “Underwriting Agreement”) between the Company and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as Representative of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”) listed in Schedule 1 to the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters intend to purchase $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 7.125% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”) to be issued pursuant to the Indenture dated as of April 9, 2009, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 15, 2012, as amended or supplemented to provide for the issuance of the Securities (together, the “Indenture”), between The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, and the Company.







This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(h) of the Underwriting Agreement.  Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.







In connection with this opinion, I, or attorneys under my supervision, have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company and Frontier Communications ILEC Holdings Inc. (the “Significant Subsidiary”), in each case as amended to date, and such documents and records and other instruments as I have deemed appropriate for purposes of the opinions set forth herein, including but not limited to the following documents (the documents referred to in clauses (1) through (3) below are referred to herein as the “Transaction Documents”):









1.


the Underwriting Agreement;












2.


the Indenture;












3.


the global securities representing the Notes to be issued on the date hereof;


















34




















4.


the Time of Sale Information; and












5.


the Prospectus.










For the purposes of this opinion, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies.  As to facts that are material to the opinions hereinafter expressed that I did not independently establish or verify, I have relied upon certificates of officers or directors of the Company and upon those certificates of public officials I considered appropriate.







I am admitted to practice only in the State of Colorado, and I express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States of America.







Based upon and relying upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications contained herein, I am of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that:









1.


The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver each Transaction Document and to perform its obligations thereunder, to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted and as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;












2.


The statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 under the headings “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings,” “Business — Regulatory Environment” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulation,” in each case insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents, conclusions, or proceedings referred to therein, in all material respects fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents, conclusions, and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein;












3.


No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to, consent of, order of, or filing with, any governmental authority in charge of laws and regulations relating to the provision of telecommunication services is required to be made or obtained by the Company for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, other than those that have been obtained or made prior to the date hereof;












4.


There is no pending or, to my knowledge, overtly threatened action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or the Significant Subsidiary or their respective properties that is not adequately disclosed in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, except in each case for such proceedings that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;


















35




















5.


None of the execution and delivery of the Indenture or the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Notes, the consummation of any other of the transactions contemplated thereby, or the fulfillment of the terms thereof will conflict with, result in a breach or violation of, or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or asset of the Company or the Significant Subsidiary pursuant any Federal Communications Commission statute, law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or the Significant Subsidiary of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the Company, its Significant Subsidiary or any of their respective properties;












6.


The Significant Subsidiary is validly existing, and based solely on certificates from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, the Significant Subsidiary is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation; and












7.


The Company, either directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries, owns all outstanding limited liability company or similar entity interests of the Significant Subsidiary free and clear of any perfected security interest and any other security interest, claim, lien or encumbrance.










The opinions expressed herein are furnished by me as Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company and are solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and solely with respect to the purchase of the Notes from the Company by the Underwriters, and, other than as stated hereunder, may not be relied upon in any manner for any other purpose, or by any other persons, without my prior written consent.







I hereby consent to reliance on the opinions expressed herein by Jones Day, counsel to the Company, and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel to the Underwriters, solely for the purpose of their respective opinions also to be rendered under the Underwriting Agreement, and not in any other manner for any other purpose, or by any other persons, without my prior written consent.







Yours faithfully,

















ANDREW CRAIN

expenses (including the reasonable fees of attorneys and other professionals and
related costs and expenses) arising directly or indirectly out of or in
connection with any claim that the Licensed Products violates any patent,
trademark, copyright and any other intellectual or industrial property right of
third parties, finally awarded in any such claim, suit or proceeding. SMSI shall

release of the Licensed Products, (b) modification of the Licensed Products
without SMSI's written consent, (c) the combination or use of the Licensed
Products with any other software, equipment, product, device, item or process
not furnished by SMSI or not contemplated under this Agreement, if such
infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Licensed Products as
contemplated herein or alone and in their current unmodified form. (d) OEM's
continued infringing activities after being notified thereof or after being
informed of modifications that would have avoided the infringement or (e) OEM's
use of the licensed product which is incidental to an infringement not resulting
primarily from the licensed product. OEM will indemnify SMSI from all damages
and liabilities related to a claim excluded from SMSI's indemnity obligation by
the previous sentence.

against any and all actions, suits, claims, liabilities, damages, losses and
expenses (including the reasonable fees of attorneys and other professionals and
related costs and expenses) arising directly or indirectly out of or in

warranty or obligation under this Agreement, or any claim that (1) the

regulation or violates any patent, trademark, copyright and any other
intellectual or industrial property right of third parties, or (2) of property

indemnifying party with the assistance, information and authority necessary to
perform the above. However, if the other party desires to have separate legal
representation in any such action, it shall be responsible for the costs and
fees related to its separate counsel. In the event a product provided by the
indemnifying party is finally held or believed by the indemnifying party to
infringe a third party's rights, the indemnifying party, at its option, shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain a license under the rights that have been
infringed, or to modify the infringing product so it is non-infringing or to
provide to the other party substitute products that are non-infringing; provided
that if in the indemnifying party's judgment such options are not commercially
reasonable, the indemnifying party may terminate the licenses granted to the
other party hereunder upon written notice to the other party.

entitled to seek injunctive relief. OEM agrees and recognizes that SMSI may
suffer immediate and irreparable harm and money damages may not be adequate to

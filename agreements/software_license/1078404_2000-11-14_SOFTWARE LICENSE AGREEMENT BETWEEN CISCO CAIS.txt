Agreement. LICENSEE further recognizes and agrees that nothing herein shall
be construed as prohibiting CISCO from pursuing any and all remedies in the
event of such breach or violation, and CISCO hereby expressly reserves such
rights and remedies.

4.   Branding. Upon and pursuant to CISCO's written request, LICENSEE shall
place CISCO's "POWERED BY IPORT(TM)" trademark, shown below or as provided
to LICENSEE by CISCO, configured as an active hyperlink to CISCO's Web

screen without scrolling down, and the mark is at least as large as the
dimensions shown below:

[LOGO OF POWERED BY IPORT]

5.   Copyright Notice/Cisco Branding. LICENSEE shall take reasonable steps to
ensure that all copies of the Software in LICENSEE's possession or control
incorporate copyright and other proprietary notices in the same manner that
CISCO incorporates such notices in the Software or in any manner reasonably
requested by CISCO. LICENSEE agrees and acknowledges that the "IPORT" mark
(a registered Trademark of CISCO), and any variations thereof and certain
other service marks, trademarks and trade names, and the goodwill therein,
and that all licensed use of any of said marks by or on behalf of LICENSEE
shall inure solely to the benefit of CISCO. LICENSEE shall have no claim or
right in the name, logo, trademarks, or other marks ("Marks") of Cisco.
LICENEE shall not make any claim to the Cisco Marks or lodge any filings
with respect to such Marks or marks confusingly similar to the Marks,
whether on behalf of CISCO or in its own name or interest, without prior
written consent of CISCO. Upon CISCO's written request, LICENSEE shall
immediately discontinue its use, if any, of any Cisco Mark.

6.   Ownership and Proprietary Rights.  LICENSEE represents, warrants,
acknowledges and agrees that CISCO has and will retain all right, title and
interest, and all ownership, in and to the Software and documentation
thereof, including but not limited to all patent, copyright, trade secret,
proprietary and other intellectual property rights in the Software and any
modifications and/or derivative works thereof. CISCO reserves the sole
right to modify and update the Software. LICENSEE will not take any action
that might impair or challenge in any way any right, title or interest of
CISCO in any such CISCO intellectual property rights. LICENSEE must not
alter or remove CISCO trade names, trademarks or copyright notices and any
other proprietary notices or trademarks on each installed copy and on the
backup copies.

7.   Term and Termination. Unless earlier terminated as provided herein, the
term of the Agreement will be for a period of five (5) years from the
Effective Date. The term of licenses granted under this Agreement will be
for a period of up to 5 years from the Effective Date. The license term of
each copy of the Software shall terminate on the earlier of 5 years from
the Effective Date or upon the termination or expiration of the then-
current term of the agreement between LICENSEE and a certain Customer
pursuant to which LICENSEE was using such copy of the Software to provide
Internet Access to that certain Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days notice if the other
party fails to comply with any material provision of this Agreement and
such failure is not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof to the
non-complying party

CONFIDENTIAL


8.   Effect of Termination.

(a)  Upon termination of the Agreement, LICENSEE will immediately
discontinue use of the Software and destroy or return to CISCO any and
all copies of the Software and any Confidential Information in the
possession of LICENSEE or LICENSEE's Customer(s) and certify to CISCO
in writing within five (5) business days after termination that
LICENSEE has destroyed or has returned to CISCO the Software and the
Confidential Information. This requirement applies to copies in all
forms, partial and complete, in all types of media and computer
memory, and whether or not modified or merged into other materials.
Termination of this Agreement will not limit either party from
pursuing any other remedies available to it, including injunctive
relief, nor will such termination relieve LICENSEE of its obligation
to pay all fees that accrued prior to such termination. Upon
termination of the Agreement, CISCO will have no further obligations
to support the Software or provide services.

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon termination or expiration of the
Agreement, no license, express or implied is granted to LICENSEE or
Customer to any CISCO proprietary rights in the Software.

9.   Payment Terms. All Software Maintenance fees and other amounts due under
this Agreement are payable within 30 days of the date of CISCO's invoice.
If not paid within 30 days of invoice date, CISCO reserves the right to
assess interest on the unpaid balance at 1.5% per month.

10.  Installation. LICENSEE will be solely responsible to Customers for
installing the Software and providing all hubs, switches, routers, server,
jacks and related wiring, and all telephone, cabling, telecommunications
and network service communications, including Internet service access
provisions, parts, and supplies, necessary for installing the Software.

11.  Software Maintenance.  Upon acceptance of and pursuant to an Order Form,
CISCO shall provide the maintenance, technical support and other services
as set forth in Exhibit B.

12.  Confidentiality. "Confidential Information" means the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the existence of the discussion between the parties,
information relating to the Software, including without limitation,
processes, techniques, formulas, ideas, know-how, works of authorship,
copyrightable works, inventions (whether patentable or not), technical
information, trade secrets, computer programs, computer code, designs,
technology, compositions, data, drawings, schematics, customers, product
development plans, and other business, technical and financial information,
and other information that is provided to LICENSEE in confidence by CISCO
or to CISCO in confidence by LICENSEE. At all times, both during this
Agreement and after its termination, each party will protect the other
party's Confidential Information from unauthorized dissemination and use
with the same degree of care that each such party uses to protect its own
like information, but with not less than reasonable care and diligence, and
shall not disclose any Confidential Information without the prior written
consent of the other party. Each party agrees to only use the other party's
Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement. Neither party
shall be obligated under this Section 12 with respect to information the
receiving party can document : (i) is or has become publicly known through
no fault of the receiving party or its employees or agents; or (ii) is
required to be disclosed by a valid court order issued by a court or
government agency, provided that the receiving party provides to the
disclosing party: (a) prior written notice of such obligation; and (b) the
opportunity to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order. Each
party acknowledges that any disclosure or unauthorized use of the other
party's Confidential Information will constitute a material breach of this
Agreement and cause substantial and irreparable harm for which damages
would not be a fully adequate remedy, and, therefore, in the event of any
such breach, in addition to other available remedies, either party shall
have the right to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.

13.  Indemnity.  LICENSEE shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless CISCO and
its officers, directors, employees, customers, agents, successors and
assigns from and against any and all loss, damage, settlement or expense,
as incurred, resulting from or arising of: (a) the combination, operation,
or use of any Software licensed hereunder with, equipment, devices, or
software not supplied by CISCO; (b) Internet Access or any other services
offered or used by LICENSEE through use of the Software; (c) alteration or
modification of any Software supplied hereunder; or (d) any use of or
access to the Software by LICENSEE or LICENSEE's Customers.

14.  Warranty Disclaimer. THE SOFTWARE AND ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR INFORMATION
PROVIDED TO LICENSEE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE BEING PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS. CISCO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
TITLE AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CISCO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE'S OR ITS CUSTOMERS' REQUIREMENTS OR
EXPECTATIONS, THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE IN THE COMBINATIONS WHICH
LICENSEE MAY SELECT FOR USE, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ALL SOFTWARE ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.
FURTHER, CISCO DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS
REGARDING USE, OR THE RESULTS OF USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN TERMS OF
CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, CURRENTNESS, OR OTHERWISE OR REGARDING
THE CUSTOMER'S OR END USER'S SATISFACTION. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS ASSUMED BY LICENSEE.

15.  Limitation of Liability. LICENSEE AGREES THAT CISCO SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY
HEREUNDER FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY THEORY WHATSPOEVER INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LICENSEE OR CUSTOMER'S LOSS OF REVENUES AND LOSS OF
PROFITS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CISCO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE EXPECTATION OR
EXISTENCE.

16.  Basis of Bargain.  EACH PARTY RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT THE WARRANTY
DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL
BARGAINED FOR BASES OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO
ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH
PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT.

any changes in address.

17.2. Assignment.  LICENSEE may not assign its rights or delegate its
obligations hereunder, either in whole or in part, whether by
operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of
CISCO. Any attempted assignment or delegation without CISCO's written
consent will be void. The rights and liabilities of the parties under
this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties'
respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, LICENSEE may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement as part of a merger, corporate reorganization, or sale of
assets, provided; i) LICENSEE first notifies CISCO in writing; and

services will be subject to the prior written approval of CISCO.

17.4. Records and Audits. LICENSEE shall use reasonable efforts  keep full,
true, and accurate records and accounts, in accordance with
generally-accepted accounting principles, of each copy of the
software deployed identifying the locations where each and every copy
of the Software has been installed or deployed by LICENSEE. LICENSEE
shall make these records reasonably available for audit by CISCO upon
reasonable prior written notice to LICENSEE, during regular business
hours, at LICENSEE's principal place of business. Unless otherwise
specified herein, the cost of the audit shall be at Cisco's expense.
If an audit reveals that the number of copies of the Software
deployed by LICENSEE pursuant to this Agreement is greater than
1,500, LICENSEE shall pay the cost of the audit as well as promptly
remit to CISCO the appropriate license fees due for the number of
copies of the Software deployed by LICENSEE in excess of 1,500.

17.5. No Agency.  The Agreement does not create any agency, partnership,
joint venture, or franchise relationship. Each party hereto is an
independent contractor. Neither party has the right or authority to,
and shall not, assume or create any obligation of any nature
whatsoever on behalf of the other party or bind the other party in
any way.

17.6. Force Majeure.  Except for the obligation to pay monies due and
owing, neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in
performance due to events outside the defaulting party's reasonable
control, including without limitation acts of God, earthquake, labor
disputes, shortages of supplies, actions of governmental entities,
riots, war, fire, epidemics, or delays of common carriers or other
circumstances beyond its reasonable control. The obligations and
rights of the excused party shall be extended on a day to day basis
for the time period equal to the period of the excusable delay.

17.7. Governing Law.  This Agreement will be governed and construed under
the laws of the State of California without giving effect to the

acting as an independent contractor and under no circumstances will
any of the employees of either party be deemed the employees or
agents of the other party for any purpose. If any provisions of this
Agreement are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions will nevertheless continue in full force and effect. No
amendments, modifications or waivers will be binding or enforceable
unless they are in writing and executed by authorized persons of each
party. This Agreement, together with all attachments and exhibits,
supersedes any and all prior agreements or understandings, both
written and oral, between LICENSEE or CII and CSS, including without
limitation any support obligations between LICENSEE or CII and CSS,
and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT  B

Software Maintenance

CISCO offers two options for Software Maintenance: (a) Software Application
Support ("SAS") and (b) Software Application Support Plus Upgrades ("SASU").

The basic Software Application Support (SAS) provides:

.    Software maintenance updates (minor releases) for the covered product upon
request
.    Access to CISCO Connection Online (CCO) where available
.    Priority 1 and 2 access to the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) 24 hours a
day, seven days a week
.    Priority 3 and 4 escalation times that correspond with local business hours

Software Application Support Plus Upgrades (SASU) provides:

.    Major software upgrades (major releases) for the covered product
.    Software maintenance updates (minor releases) for the covered product
.    Upgrades and updates automatically shipped when the new release is made
orderable
.    Priority 1 and 2 access to the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) 24 hours a
day, seven days a week
.    Priority 3 and 4 escalation times that correspond with local business hours
.    Access to CCO where available

CISCO requests that LICENSEE provide the priority of every case reported. To
ensure that all problems are reported in a standard format, CISCO has
established the following problem priority definitions:

.    Priority 1---An existing network is down or there is a critical impact to
the LICENSEE's business operations. CISCO and the LICENSEE will commit
necessary resources around the clock to resolve the situation.

.    Priority 2---Operation of an existing network is severely degraded, or
significant aspects of the LICENSEE's business operation are being
negatively impacted by unacceptable network performance. CISCO and the
LICENSEE will commit full-time resources during normal business hours to
resolve the situation.

.    Priority 3---Operational performance of the network is impaired while most
business operations remain functional. CISCO and the LICENSEE are willing
to commit resources during normal business hours to restore service to
satisfactory levels.

.    Priority 4---LICENSEE requires information or assistance on CISCO product
capabilities, installation, or configuration. There is clearly little or no
impact to the LICENSEE's business operation. CISCO and the LICENSEE are
willing to provide resources during normal business hours to provide
information or assistance as requested.


Software Maintenance Renewal

The annual fee for Software Maintenance as defined will be as follows: a) for
SAS - 20% of the then current CISCO's list price for the Software licenses; and
b) for SASU- 25% of the then current CISCO's list price for the Software
licenses. The Software Maintenance term may be renewed by the LICENSEE on an
annual basis.

Void Software Maintenance

LICENSEE shall notify CISCO prior to installation or integration of any not-
previously approved computer hardware component (i.e., video card, network
adapter, etc.) any not-previously approved software component or version
upgrades. LICENSEE understands that CISCO does not guarantee compatibility of
its Software with any hardware or software not certified for use as part of the
System.

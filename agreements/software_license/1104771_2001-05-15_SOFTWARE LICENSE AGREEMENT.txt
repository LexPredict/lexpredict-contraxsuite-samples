the following schedule:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S>                                                                    <C>

</TABLE>

3.2 In return for the licenses granted pursuant to Section 2.3 and
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, OmniSky agrees to pay
Handspring a license fee for the initial three years of the term of this
Agreement equal to $[***], of which (i) $[***] shall be due and payable on the
Acceptance Date, (ii) $[***] shall be due and payable on the first anniversary
of the Effective Date and (iii) $[***] shall be due and payable on the second

In furtherance of the foregoing and in consideration of the performance
by Handspring of its obligations under Section 2.3, OmniSky agrees to pay
Handspring the annual maintenance fees for the Proxy Software set forth in the
following schedule:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S>                                                                    <C>
Acceptance Date (covering the first full year):               $[***]

subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, OmniSky agrees to expend
not less than an aggregate of $[***] for marketing and related activities which

[***] Confidential treatment has been requested for the bracketed portions. The

<PAGE>   6
the second anniversary of the Effective Date and (iii) the remaining $[***] of
such Marketing Funds shall be expended by the third anniversary of the Effective
Date. The Marketing Funds will be used for marketing and other promotional
activities that have been approved in advance by both OmniSky and Handspring.
Such activities may include, but are not limited to, prominent mention of
Handspring in advertisements, subsidization of wireless modems for use with
Handspring devices and inclusion of Handspring products in OmniSky media events.
Before any amounts may be credited against OmniSky's marketing obligations,
OmniSky must submit a request to Handspring, together with a description of the
activities and a budget of the costs of the activities, for approval. Handspring
will use reasonable efforts to respond to each such request within ten (10) days
of receipt. OmniSky may credit against its marketing obligations hereunder any
activities approved by Handspring pursuant to this Section 3.3. If OmniSky
expends, or causes to be expended, an amount which exceeds the approved budgeted
amount, any amounts that exceed the approved budget by more than 10% shall not
be credited against OmniSky's marketing obligations unless and until such excess
amounts are approved by Handspring.

3.4 In return for Handspring licensing and providing to OmniSky the
Handspring Derivative Works, OmniSky shall reimburse Handspring, within 30 days
after receipt of invoice therefor, for all amounts payable by Handspring to its
licensors and other third-party suppliers that would not have been payable by
Handspring but for OmniSky's exercise of the licenses granted hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at least thirty (30) days prior to any delivery
to OmniSky of a Handspring Derivative Work, Handspring shall notify OmniSky in
writing of the amount of the reimbursement obligation that would be incurred by
OmniSky as a result of such Handspring Derivative Work. If OmniSky notifies
Handspring in writing within ten (10) business days after receiving the
foregoing reimbursement notice that OmniSky wishes to exclude such Handspring
Derivative Work from the licenses granted hereunder, Handspring shall not
deliver to OmniSky such Handspring Derivative Work, and OmniSky shall not be
responsible for any reimbursement obligation with respect thereto.

3.5 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at anytime Handspring shall
license both the Client Software and the Proxy Software (excluding any hosting
of the Proxy Software by Handspring on an ASP-basis) to any Entity identified in
Exhibit C (a "Third Party License") in consideration for licensing, maintenance
or other fees which, in the aggregate and in light of any different terms of
such Third Party License, are less than the aggregate of the licensing,
maintenance and other fees (excluding the Marketing Funds) payable by OmniSky
hereunder, then the licensing, maintenance and other fees payable by OmniSky
hereunder shall automatically be reduced to an amount equal or, in light of any
different terms of such Third Party License, equivalent to the fees payable
under the Third Party License; provided that, under no circumstances shall
Handspring be required pursuant to this Section 3.5 to refund amounts previously
paid by OmniSky to Handspring under this Agreement. Handspring agrees to notify
OmniSky in writing within fourteen (14) days after its execution of any
agreement which triggers the fee reduction set forth in this Section 3.5.

confidential redacted portion has been omitted and filed separately with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

ARTICLE 4

TECHNICAL SUPPORT

4.1 Handspring shall provide OmniSky with technical support of the
Proxy Software at the levels set forth on Exhibit D and for the period(s)
provided below. All technical support provided by Handspring will be performed
in a full and professional manner by qualified individuals. OmniSky shall pay
Handspring a total of $[***] in four equal installments of $[***] due in
advance, respectively, on the Acceptance Date and three, six and nine months
after the Effective Date, which shall entitle OmniSky to support through the
first anniversary of the Effective Date. Subject to OmniSky's continued payment
therefor, such support shall automatically renew for subsequent one-year terms
on the same terms unless OmniSky notifies Handspring, at least sixty (60) days
before the end of the then-current term, of its election not to renew. OmniSky
may terminate support at any time by written notice to Handspring; provided
that, if such termination occurs before the first anniversary of the Effective
Date, any unpaid balance of the $[***] fee for the initial year of such services
shall accelerate and be payable in full upon such termination. If such
termination occurs after the first anniversary of the Effective Date, OmniSky
shall not be responsible for any installment of the $[***] fee for the current
renewal term which has not yet become due pursuant to this Section 4.1. In
addition to the foregoing technical support, Handspring shall provide OmniSky,
at no additional charge, up to ten (10) hours per calendar quarter of technical
support regarding the use of the source code to the Client Software (in such
form as delivered hereunder by Handspring). OmniSky shall be solely responsible
for support of its Customers.

4.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at anytime hereafter Handspring
commences providing technical support in substantially the same manner as
described in Section 4.1 as part of its licensing terms for the Licensed
Software for fees that, in the aggregate and in light of any different terms of
such technical support, are less than the fees payable by OmniSky therefor, then
the fees payable by OmniSky shall automatically be reduced to an amount equal
or, in light of any such different terms, equivalent to such lower fees.

4.3 Without limiting the technical support provided in Section 4.1,
within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, Handspring shall conduct a
one-day training program regarding the Licensed Software for up to an aggregate
of ten (10) OmniSky personnel. Such program will take place at a time and place
mutually agreed by the parties, and shall be conducted in such a manner as is
reasonably adequate to train OmniSky personnel in relevant aspects of the
Licensed Software, including without limitation, the server architecture and
operations, installation, configuration, troubleshooting, scaling and tuning.

version and object code version of any OmniSky Derivative Work; provided that,
for the period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of delivery to
Handspring of any OmniSky Derivative Work, Handspring shall be prohibited from
distributing such OmniSky Derivative Work to or using such OmniSky Derivative
Work on behalf of any other licensee of the Client Software without OmniSky's
prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Handspring's rights in the
source code of OmniSky Derivative Works shall terminate upon expiration or
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

5.4 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, OmniSky hereby grants to
Handspring, under any rights exercisable by OmniSky now or hereafter in OmniSky

have the right to terminate this Agreement for convenience for any reason or no
reason upon thirty (30) days advance written notice to Handspring.

termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article 6, all rights and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be extinguished, except
that (a) if OmniSky terminates for convenience as provided above, all unpaid
installments of the Client Software license fee set forth in Section 3.1 shall
accelerate and be paid in full on or prior to such termination, provided that
all such unpaid installments shall be cancelled if OmniSky terminates this

claim in reliance on the limitation of liability under Article 12, (b) all other
accrued payment obligations hereunder shall survive such termination or
expiration, (c) the rights and obligations of the parties under Articles 5, 6,

consent, all of OmniSky's rights in the source code of the Client Software (and
any updates) licensed hereunder shall terminate immediately prior to such
assignment, and OmniSky shall, prior to effectiveness of such assignment,
deliver to Handspring all copies of such source code within its possession or
control, together with a writing executed by an officer of OmniSky certifying
that no copies of such source code have been delivered or disclosed to any third

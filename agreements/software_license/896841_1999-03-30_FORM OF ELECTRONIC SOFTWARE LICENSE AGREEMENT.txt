AVID TECHNOLOGY,  INC. ("AVID") OR ITS AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR OR RESELLER AS THE
CASE MAY BE (AVID OR SUCH  DISTRIBUTOR  OR  RESELLER  IS  SOMETIMES  HEREINAFTER
REFERRED TO AS  "LICENSOR")  IS WILLING TO LICENSE  THIS  SOFTWARE  TO YOU,  THE
LICENSEE,  ONLY UPON THE CONDITION  THAT YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS  CONTAINED IN THIS
LICENSE.  BY CLICKING ON THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON,  YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY

DAYS OF THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO THE PLACE YOU OBTAINED IT FOR A FULL REFUND.

1.  DEFINITIONS (as used in this Agreement):
(a) "SOFTWARE" means all software,  in object code only, provided by Licensor to
you  hereunder,  together  with all  firmware,  technology  contained in circuit
boards, and all Avid-authorized updates,  replacements or modifications provided
to you.

(b)  "HARDWARE"  means any  computer  and/or  other  equipment  which is sold by
Licensor to you in  conjunction  with the  Software.  The  Hardware  may contain
refurbished parts.

(c)  "DOCUMENTATION"  means the user  guides,  reference  manuals,  installation
materials  and other  written  materials  relating to the System which  Licensor
provides to you

(d) "SYSTEM"  means a system  furnished  by Licensor  and  comprised of Hardware
and/or Software and related Documentation.

2.  LIMITED USE LICENSE
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions  contained in this  Agreement,  Licensor
grants,  and you accept, a non-exclusive,  non-transferable  (except as provided
below) license and right (i) to use the Software only on and in connection  with
the Hardware at your site, and (ii) to use the  Documentation,  in each case for
your  internal  purposes  only.  You may not use the Software  separate from the
Hardware,  or any  replacement  Hardware,  and you may not  make  copies  of the
Software or  Documentation,  except  that you may make one copy of the  Software
solely for back-up purposes.  Additionally, you may not distribute copies of the
Software  or the  Documentation  to others nor may you modify or  translate  the
Software or  Documentation.  You may not transfer the Software or this  license,
except in compliance with Avid's license transfer procedures,  which among other
things require the  transferee  prior to such transfer to agree in writing to be
bound by your obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may rent
the System to a third party for a temporary,  defined period  provided:  (i) you
may  not  rent  the  Software  separate  from  the  Hardware;  (ii)  you  remain
responsible for all of your  obligations  hereunder;  (iii) you ensure that each
such third party complies with all obligations  hereunder;  (iv) you notify Avid
on request of the location of the System; and (v) you indemnify, defend and hold
Licensor  (if not  Avid)  and Avid  harmless  from and  against  any  claims  or
liabilities that may arise from your rental of the System.

(b) You will  take  all  reasonable  steps to  safeguard  the  Software  and the
Documentation  and to ensure  that no  unauthorized  persons  have access to the
Software  or the  Documentation,  and that no  persons  authorized  to have such
access  shall take any action  which would be  prohibited  by this  Agreement if
taken by you.  You will not attempt to reverse  engineer or reverse  compile the
Software,  in whole or in part,  except  that if the  country  in which  you are
located requires  Licensor to allow you to reverse engineer the Software you may
do so only for the specific  purposes  for which  Licensor is required by law to
allow you to reverse engineer. You will include and will not alter or remove any
copyright,   patent,  trade  secret,  proprietary  and/or  other  legal  notices
contained on or in the System, including the Software or the Documentation.  The
existence  of any such  notices on or in the System shall not be construed as an
admission that publication has occurred.

(c) The Software may have  "authorization  keys" which shall be provided to you.
An  authorization  key is a unique series of data elements  which enables you to
use the Software.  Such keys are confidential and  non-transferable  and must be
destroyed by you upon termination of the license.

(d) If you are renting the System from the  licensee  who  purchased  the System
from  Licensor,  you  shall be bound by all the  terms  and  conditions  of this
Agreement  to the same  extent as the such  licensee;  provided,  however,  that
Licensor makes no warranties to you under Section 6 below,  and you shall not be
entitled to any Software maintenance and support, if any, provided by Avid under
Section 7 below.

3.  TITLE
This license is not a sale of the Software or any copy.  Avid retains  title and
ownership of the Software and the documentation,  including patents, copyrights,
trademarks,  trade secrets and other proprietary rights applicable thereto,  and
all copies,  regardless  of the form or media on or in which the original or any
copy may exist.  Except as stated herein,  this Agreement does not grant you any
rights to patents,  copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks or any other rights in
respect of Software, Hardware and Documentation.

4.  CONFIDENTIALITY
You acknowledge that the System contains  proprietary and confidential  property
of Avid and/or Avid's licensors (collectively,  "Confidential Information"). You
will not disclose,  provide or otherwise  make  available any such  Confidential
Information to any person other than your employees and/or  consultants who need
to have  access  thereto  to  carry  out  their  duties  and who  are  bound  by
appropriate confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements.

5.  GOVERNMENT END USERS
U.S.  GOVERNMENT  RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The System was developed at private expense
and with no government funds. If any Software or Documentation is acquired by or
on behalf of a unit or agency of the U.S. Government, the Government agrees that
such Software or Documentation is "commercial  computer software" or "commercial
computer  software  documentation"  and that,  absent a written agreement to the
contrary, the Government's rights with respect to such Software or Documentation
are  limited  by the  terms  of the  this  License  Agreement,  pursuant  to FAR
ss.12.212(a)  and/or  DFARS  ss.227.7202-1(a),  as  applicable.  The Software is
proprietary  data,  all rights of which are reserved under the copyright laws of
the United States.

6.  WARRANTY
(a) Licensor  warrants solely to you that the System will function in accordance
with  Avid's  published  specifications  for  the  period(s)  set  forth  in the
applicable warranty policy in effect at the time of purchase. This warranty does
not apply to  expendable  components,  such as,  but not  limited  to,  computer
diskettes and tapes.  Licensor does not warrant that your use of the System will
be uninterrupted or error-free.

(b) If Licensor determines that the System, or the component parts thereof,  for
which you have requested warranty service are not eligible for warranty service,
you will pay or reimburse Licensor for all reasonable costs of investigating and
responding  to such request at  Licensor's  then  prevailing  time and materials
rates.  If Licensor  provides  repair service or replacement  parts that are not
covered by the  warranty  provided  in this  Section,  you will pay  Licensor at
Licensor's then prevailing time and materials rates.

(c) Licensor shall have no obligation to provide warranty or maintenance service
in respect of claims resulting, in whole or in part, from (i) catastrophe, fault
or negligence,  (ii) improper or unauthorized use or repair of the System, (iii)
use of any  System  in a manner  for  which  it was not  designed,  (iv)  causes
external to the System such as, but not  limited to,  power  failure or electric
power surges, or (v) use of the System in combination with equipment or software
not supplied or approved by Avid.

(d)  Notwithstanding the above, no warranty shall apply to Hardware and Software
which is designated as "limited  release" or  "pre-release"  or otherwise as not
being  subject to warranty.  All such  Hardware and Software is provided "AS IS"
AND WITH ALL FAULTS.

EXCEPT AS STATED ABOVE, LICENSOR (IF NOT AVID) AND AVID DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
WHETHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  WRITTEN OR ORAL, WITH RESPECT TO THE SYSTEM OR ANY
COMPONENT PARTS THEREOF,  INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF  MERCHANTABILITY  OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7.  SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE (Applicable only if Avid provides maintenance)
Software  maintenance  charges and options are specified in the Avid Maintenance
Option/Price  List effective from time to time and are subject to change by Avid
on 30 days'  notice.  In the  event  you  purchase  Software  maintenance,  such
maintenance  shall be subject to the terms and conditions  effective on the date
of such purchase,  and Avid shall provide the following,  plus options,  if any,
which you purchase, effective immediately upon expiry of the applicable warranty
period.

(a) You will  receive  one copy of  maintenance  releases  to the  Software  and
Documentation  as they are generally made  available at no additional  charge to
Avid  customers  which have  purchased  Avid software  maintenance.  Maintenance
releases may contain minor functional enhancements and corrections.

(b) Avid will use  reasonable  efforts,  including by means of a  workaround  or
telephone hot-line support,  to cause Software not covered by Avid's warranty to
perform  substantially  in  accordance  with  specifications  after  having been
notified by you of non-performance.

(c)  Avid  will  provide  maintenance  only on the  then  most  current  and one
immediately  prior  version  of  the  Software.  Avid's  obligation  to  provide
maintenance shall be conditioned on your: using only Avid-approved  products and
maintaining the correct  operating  environment in accordance with  requirements
stipulated in the  applicable  System  specifications;  designating  one of your
employees at each site to be Avid's  single  service  contact and allowing  Avid
reasonable  access to the System and necessary  data;  promptly  installing  all
changes  and/or  updates  furnished by or on behalf of Avid;  notifying  Avid in
writing prior to relocating  the System to a permitted  location  other than the
site at which the System is then-currently  installed;  and being current in all
payments to Avid.

(d) In the event you  request a field visit to perform  maintenance  or warranty
services,  you agree to pay Avid its then-current  charges associated with field
visits.

8.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF LICENSOR AND/OR AVID (AND ITS LICENSORS) ARISING OUT OF
THE  SALE/LICENSE  OF THE  SYSTEM  OR  THE  USE  THEREOF  OR  THE  PROVISION  OF
MAINTENANCE, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT
EXCEED THE ACTUAL PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY IT.

9.  EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES
IN NO EVENT  SHALL  LICENSOR  AND/OR  AVID (AND ITS  LICENSORS)  BE  LIABLE  FOR
SPECIAL,  INCIDENTAL,  PUNITIVE,  INDIRECT,  ECONOMIC OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES,
INCLUDING,  BUT NOT LIMITED  TO, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE DAMAGES  (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION  "DOWNTIME") AND LOST PROFITS,  ARISING HEREUNDER OR FROM THE
SALE OF SYSTEM OR THE LICENSE OF THE  SOFTWARE AND  DOCUMENTATION  OR THE USE OF
ANY OF THEM OR THE PROVISION OF MAINTENANCE.

10. TERM
This license is effective until terminated. You may terminate the license at any
time by returning the Software and all Documentation to Licensor and by removing
the Software and all copies  thereof from the memory of any computer  into which
the Software has been  transferred.  If you fail to perform any of your material
obligations hereunder, Licensor will offer you 15 days' opportunity to cure such
nonperformance.  Upon expiry of such period  without  the  nonperformance  being
cured,  Licensor may by  immediate  written  notice  terminate  this  Agreement,
including the license of the Software and the  Documentation.  Within seven days
of Licensor's  termination  of this  Agreement,  you will return to Licensor the
original and all copies of the Software and the Documentation.  Any Software you
are  required  to return  hereunder  includes  circuit  boards  containing  Avid
proprietary software, firmware or other technology.

11. EXPORT
You agree that neither the Software nor any direct  product  thereof is being or
will be shipped,  transferred  or reexported,  directly or indirectly,  into any
country  prohibited  by the  United  States  Export  Administration  Act and the
regulations thereunder or will be used for any purposes prohibited by the Act.

12. GENERAL
(a) If Avid is not the Licensor  under this  Agreement,  the parties  agree that
Avid is an intended  third party  beneficiary  of this Agreement and may enforce
the provisions hereof.

(b) This Agreement  supersedes all prior agreements and  understandings  between
the parties  related to the subject matter herein and is intended by the parties
to be the complete and exclusive statement of the terms of their Agreement.  Any
proposed  variations  from or  additions  to  this  Agreement  contained  in any
purchase order or other  communication which you submit to Licensor will be null
and  void  unless  agreed  to in  writing  by an  authorized  representative  of
Licensor.

(c) The remedies  contained  herein are  cumulative and in addition to any other
remedies at law or equity.  Licensor's failure to enforce, or waiver of a breach
of, any  provision  hereof shall not  constitute a waiver of any other breach of
such provision.  You acknowledge  that a breach by you of Section 2 or 4 of this
Agreement would  constitute  irreparable  harm to Avid for which a remedy at law
would be inadequate and therefore consent to being enjoined from any such breach
without requiring Licensor or Avid to post a bond.

(d)  Licensor  shall  not  be  considered  in  default  in  performance  of  its
obligations hereunder if performance of such obligations is prevented or delayed
by  acts  of God or  government,  war,  riots,  acts of  civil  disorder,  labor
disputes,  failure  or  delay of  transportation  or  telecommunications,  or by
vendors  or  subcontractors,  or any other  similar  cause or causes  beyond its
reasonable control.

(e) The terms and conditions of this Agreement will be held as  confidential  by
both parties hereto, provided, however, that Licensor and Avid may cite that you
are a user of the System.

(f) The System is manufactured for standard commercial uses and are not intended
to be sold or licensed for use in critical safety systems or nuclear facilities.

(g)  This  Agreement  shall  be  governed  by the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts, U.S.A., without regard to conflict of laws rules that would cause
the laws of any other jurisdiction to apply.

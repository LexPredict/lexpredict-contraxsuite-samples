6    Proprietary Information

The parties anticipate that during the term of this Agreement, it may be necessary for either party to transfer to the other party information of a proprietary nature. Each of the parties agrees that it will use the
same reasonable efforts to protect the other’s Proprietary Information as are used to protect its own but will at least use reasonable care. Disclosures of such information shall be restricted to those individuals who are directly participating
in the JTRS or the MUOS programs and contract efforts identified herein, who have a need to know such information, and who have been made aware of and consent to abide by the restrictions herein concerning the use of such information.

Each party warrants that it has the right to disclose the Proprietary Information disclosed
to the other party hereunder for the purpose set out in this Agreement.

Except
as expressly provided herein neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the furnishing of any Proprietary Information shall be construed as granting either expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license under any
invention, improvement, discovery or patent now or hereafter owned or controlled by a party disclosing Proprietary Information hereunder.

If either Party should be required by law or regulation, or receive a subpoena, court order or other governmental order that compels such Party to disclose Proprietary
Information of the other Party, it shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party so the latter may take necessary steps to prevent or limit disclosure. In any event, the Receiving Party shall disclose only so much of the Disclosing Party’s
Proprietary Information as is required by law.

7    Limitations on Usage of Licensee Furnished Items

Licensee furnished items are defined to be any software, firmware, hardware, systems, or documentation, provided by Licensee to Licensor. Licensor shall not reverse engineer Licensee furnished items. Upon completion
of the effort under the attached SOW, or upon request by Licensee, whichever occurs first, the Licensor shall return all Licensee furnished items to Licensee, unless otherwise specified by Licensee in writing or in the requirements of the SOW.


8    Quality Assurance/Configuration
Management/Safety Requirements

Licensor shall establish and maintain
a quality assurance system that complies with its standard commercial processes with the intent of meeting ISO 9001 and other applicable industry standards that Licensor has adopted as part of its quality program. Licensor will allow Licensee
representative(s) to witness testing at Licensor’s facility for any software that will be delivered to Licensee as part of a Milestone described within this Agreement.

Subsequent to Agreement Effective Date, Quality and Configuration Management plans will be generated (either as a stand alone or
incorporated within other plans). The resulting quality or configuration management plan will clearly describe the technical change review board process that will be conducted between Licensor and Licensee.

Licensee may require Licensor to provide data and perform analysis in support of MUOS program
safety requirements that may be subsequently required under this Agreement after the Effective Date. Any resulting safety requirements will be negotiated in good faith and accepted in writing by the Parties, but will be included within the scope of
this Agreement.


** Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

9    Malicious Software or Systems

The Licensor shall determine that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the software and
systems provided do not contain any malicious code, program, or other internal component (e.g., computer virus) which could damage, destroy, or alter software, firmware, or hardware or which could reveal any data or other information accessed
through or processed by the software or systems. Further, the Licensor shall immediately inform Licensee upon reasonable suspicion that any software or systems provided hereunder may cause the harm described above.

10    Force Majeure

A Party shall be excused for nonperformance under this Agreement, for such period of time as
the cause of non-performance continues to exist, if the failure to perform arises, in whole or in part, out of causes beyond the control and without the negligence of the Party. Such causes may include, but are not restricted to (a) acts of God or
of the public enemy, (b) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (c) fires, (d) floods, (e) epidemics, (f) quarantine restrictions, (g) strikes, (h) freight embargoes and (i) unusually severe weather. If the delay is
caused by a delay of Licensor and if such delay arises out of causes beyond the reasonable control of both, and without the negligence of either, Licensor shall be excused from nonperformance unless the goods to be furnished by the Licensor were
obtainable from other sources at substantially the same cost in sufficient time to permit Licensor to meet the required delivery schedules. Licensor shall notify Licensee in writing within ten (10) calendar days after the beginning of any such
cause.

11    Governing Law and Venue


This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware. No consideration shall be given to Delaware’s conflict of laws rules. To the extent not provided for in Section 12, the Parties agree and consent to exclusive venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts
located in Delaware for all controversies and disputes arising under or in any way relating to this Agreement.

12    Disputes

(a)    Any dispute between the Parties shall be settled in the following manner: Licensee and Licensor agree to enter into a negotiation to resolve any dispute. Both parties agree to negotiate in good faith to reach a
mutually agreeable settlement within a reasonable amount of time. Each Party will appoint a senior management representative who does not devote substantially all of his or her time to performance under this Agreement. The representatives will
furnish to each other all non-privileged information with respect to the dispute that the Parties believe to be appropriate and germane. The representatives will negotiate in an effort to resolve the dispute without the necessity of any formal
proceeding. [**]

(b)    [**] Either Party will have the
right to apply at any time to a judicial authority for appropriate injunctive or other interim or provisional relief [**]


** Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.


12








13    Injunctive Relief

The Parties agree to the confidentiality provisions contained in Section 6, above, and acknowledge that the unauthorized disclosure of any
information required to be kept confidential pursuant to this Agreement may give rise to immediate irreparable injury to the Party that owns the information. Notwithstanding the dispute resolution provision contained herein, each Party may obtain
immediate and injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach by the other Party of the covenants to keep such information confidential. The Parties further agree that the covenants contained herein are reasonably necessary for the
protection of legitimate business interests of the Parties and are reasonable in scope and content.

14    Severability

In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or
invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.


15    Export/Security Regulations

Licensee agrees that it will not in any form export, re-export, ship, or divert or cause to
be diverted, directly or indirectly, the Licensed Software to any country for which the United States Government, any agency thereof, or any other sovereign Government, at the time of export or reexport, requires an export license or other
governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval. Furthermore, Licensor understands that the majority of MUOS Technical Information and Technical Services are subject to U.S. Government export control laws and regulations.
Therefore, Licensor shall be responsible for compliance with all applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations including the requirements of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
Licensor agrees that, except as allowed under applicable U.S. laws and regulations, no export controlled item, data, or service, furnished to it on or produced by it for the MUOS Program will be disclosed to any foreign person, business, or country,
including foreign persons employed by or associated with, or under contract with the Licensor, without the authority of an export license, agreement or applicable license exemption. In the event the Licensor or any sub tier supplier needs to
disclose MUOS export-controlled items, data or services to foreign persons, the Licensor shall be responsible (i) for obtaining, and ensuring its sub tier supplier obtains, all necessary approvals from the Government and any required export license,
agreement or applicable license exemption and (ii) for compliance with the terms of the export license, agreement or exemption. Licensor shall first notify and obtain the written consent of Licensee prior to it or its sub tier supplier submitting
any request for authority to export MUOS technical data or services. Licensor is responsible for including export control requirements in sub tier supplier agreements, and for ensuring that the suppliers are capable of complying with all applicable
U.S. Government export control laws and regulations.

Licensor is responsible
for maintaining an effective export/import compliance program that ensures compliance to government export control laws and regulations. Licensor is responsible for maintenance of proper policies and procedures, personnel training, and marking of
documents, as appropriate, in accordance with such export/import compliance program.

If required by Licensee, Licensor agrees to implement security requirements mandated by the U.S. Government issued via a DD-254 to Lockheed Martin’s contract and subsequently flowed down to



13









Licensee’s contract. If Licensor is unable to implement or follow such requirements, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve such issue or
issues.

16    Records, Audit Rights


At all times during the term of this Agreement and for [**] following the
termination of this Agreement, Licensee will maintain at its principal place of business accurate records relating to its licensing obligations under this Agreement.

17    Point of Contact Designation

The Licensor shall designate to Licensee, in writing, a representative to serve as point of contact for the Licensor with Licensee or the
Government.

18    Guidelines on Nationality


Licensor further understands that Licensee is a defense contractor
providing work for the United States Government, and as such, is under certain mandatory security obligations with regard to access to its facilities and technology. Due to the fact that disclosure of certain information to any individual may be
deemed an export, Licensor agrees that it will not assign any worker to perform services under this Agreement on Licensee’s premises for the applicable program unless that person either receives a license for the export at issue or qualifies as
a “U.S. person.” The following persons shall be defined as a “U. S. person”:


i.	U.S. citizen;



ii.	U.S. nationals, including an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (those possessing a valid Form I-550 or “green card”);



iii.	Alien admitted following a 1986 amnesty statute;



iv.	Asylee or refugee as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1324(b)(a)(3); or



v.	Alien lawfully admitted for temporary agricultural employment.


18.1    Access to Information

Licensor further agrees that, should Licensee determine that the work performed under this Agreement will enable persons working for the Licensor (including the Licensor)
to have access to unclassified information that relates to a U.S. Government classified program, or other information regulated by the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (‘NISPOM”), Licensor will not assign any worker to
perform services under this Agreement (including the Licensor) unless such persons are citizens or nationals of the United States.

In addition to the foregoing requirements, Licensor will comply with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (“IRCA”) and in particular, have all of its
applicable workers fill out an I-9 form, verifying their authorization to work in the United States.


** Material has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.


14








Licensee agrees to conspicuously mark all documentation and technical information that is subject to a U.S. Government
classified program (including NISPOM). Licensee further agrees to use its best efforts to assist Licensor from time to time, upon request, to determine the appropriate export control classification of particular documentation and technical
information (e.g., whether subject to ITAR or EAR, and USML Category or Export Control Classification No.). Furthermore, Licensee represents and warrants to Licensor that all persons assigned by Licensee to communicate with Licensor in
connection with this Agreement are “U.S. persons” as defined in Section 18 above.

19    Gratuities

Licensor warrants that neither it nor any of its employees, agents or representatives have offered or given, or will offer or give, any gratuities to Licensee’s employees, agents or representatives for the purpose of securing this
Agreement or securing favorable treatment under this Agreement.

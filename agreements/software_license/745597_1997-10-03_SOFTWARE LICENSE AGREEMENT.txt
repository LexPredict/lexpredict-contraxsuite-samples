substantially  affect the  functionality of the NetLOCK Software or its
compliance  with the  Specifications,  which errors may be corrected in
the next SHIM release,  provided such release is made at least once per
year.

(c)  Provision  to INTERLINK of not more than one (1)
platform update per year due to a manufacturer's change in an operating
system;  provided that such platform  update is reasonably  expected to

Specification.

*Confidential Treatment Requested


<PAGE>

In the event that  INTERLINK  purchases  Support for at least five (5) Platforms
per year, MENTAT shall make limited  enhancements such as functionality  changes
to the SHIMs  ("Enhancements") as required by INTERLINK's NetLOCK product plans.
Such Enhancements shall consist of changes or updates requiring no more than two
(2) person weeks of effort,  and MENTAT shall not be obligated to make more than
three (3) to five (5) such  Enhancements  during any one (1) year of the license
term, as mutually  agreed by MENTAT and INTERLINK.  With respect to Enhancements
requiring  more than two (2)  person  weeks of work,  operating  system  updates
requiring more than two (2) person weeks of work, or if more than three (3) such
Enhancements or operating  system updates are requested  during any one (1) year

extent  feasible  given  MENTAT's  engineering  resources and shall be billed to
INTERLINK  on the basis of [*] per person week  devoted to such  Enhancement  or
operating system update.

Section 2.2 Costs.  Except as otherwise  provided herein,  MENTAT shall
bear all costs, and expenses,  including travel (but excluding travel outside of
Southern  California)  and  salary,  incurred  in the Support of SHIMs by MENTAT

to create and maintain its SHIMs if such computer equipment can be purchased for
less than [*]. At  MENTAT's  request,  INTERLINK  will make  computer  equipment
available  to  MENTAT  for  all  other  Platforms  in a  manner  similar  to the
availability  of this equipment to INTERLINK's own  development  staff.  For the
purposes of this paragraph,  it is assumed that MENTAT can maintain a SHIM for a
particular  Platform  using a single  computer of the type for which the SHIM is
targeted.

<PAGE>

Section 3.2 Sublicenses.  In each instance where INTERLINK  sublicenses
the source code of the Licensed  SHIMs to a sublicensee  in connection  with the
distribution  and sale of the NetLOCK  Software,  INTERLINK  shall  require such

protection  of the  Licensed  SHIMs that shall be no less  restrictive  than the
terms and conditions relating thereto contained in this Agreement.

Section 3.3 End User Agreement. INTERLINK agrees, and shall require all
its  sublicensees to agree,  to distribute  Licensed SHIMs to third parties only
pursuant to an appropriate  end user  agreement,  such as the end user agreement
attached  hereto as Attachment C, and will take all reasonable  steps to protect
MENTAT's proprietary rights in the Licensed SHIMs. Attachment C contains the end
user  agreement  for  domestic  licenses and that will be the basis for end user
agreements for international  licenses. No rights or licenses are granted herein
to  INTERLINK,  expressly  or by  implication,  under  any  MENTAT  intellectual
property, other than the license granted in Section 3.1.


ARTICLE IV

PROPRIETARY DATA

All Proprietary Data furnished  hereunder by one party to another shall
be treated under  conditions of confidence.  The receiving party agrees:  to use

Agreement;  to inform  further  recipients of such  information  and software in
advance or at the time of delivery to the  recipients  and in writing that it is
to be treated in confidence;  and to afford such  Proprietary  Data at least the
same degree of  protection  against  disclosure  or  unauthorized  use which the
receiving party exercises in the protection of its own equivalent property,  but
in no event less than  reasonable  care. To the extent that any  information and
software is further transferred by a party as permitted by this Agreement,  such
party will impose the same  requirements  and  restrictions  on the recipient as
apply to it. The  receiving  party  shall  have no  obligation  with  respect to
information  which:  is  publicly  known  otherwise  than by the  breach of this
Agreement by the receiving  party;  or has been  independently  developed by the
receiving party; or was already known to the receiving party prior to disclosure
by the disclosing party and was without  restriction;  or has been  subsequently
received  lawfully  from a third  party  and is  without  restriction.  With the
exception of source code for which there is no time limit, all of the provisions
of this Article 4 regarding use and confidentiality  shall survive expiration or
termination  of this  Agreement  for a period of ten (10) years from the date of
termination.

source code becomes known to LICENSEE in any manner, LICENSEE will preserve such
source code in  confidence  and will not disclose  such source code to any third
parties, including, but not limited to, prime contractors,  subcontractors,  and

THIS AGREEMENT.  THE FOREGOING  STATES THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF
HUGHES.

6.       LICENSEE  will not knowingly  export or transfer,  whether  directly or
indirectly,  the  Licensed  Programs  or any  system  containing  such  Licensed
Programs to anyone  outside the country of delivery  without  first  obtaining a
license from the U.S.  Department  of Commerce or any other agency or department
of the United States Government, as required.

7.       In  the  event  any  provision  of this  License  Agreement  is  deemed
unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be modified so as to make it valid
and enforceable, and as so modified the entire agreement will remain in force.

8.       This  License  Agreement  is  effective  until  terminated.  It  may be

automatically  if LICENSEE fails to comply with any of the terms of this License
Agreement,  and on any such termination LICENSEE will destroy the software media
and backup copies.

Agreement  constitutes a waiver of Hughes' rights under US Copyright laws or any
other federal or state law.

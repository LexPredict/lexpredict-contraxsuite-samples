ARTICLE II
THE UNDERTAKING.

2.1  Undertaking.

(a) TECO hereby unconditionally and irrevocably:

(i) guarantees (as primary obligor and not as surety), in favor
of the Beneficiaries, the prompt performance in full of all performance (in the
case of each reference to "performance" herein, to cause performance through
TECO's causing another party to perform Contractor's performance obligations
strictly in accordance with the terms of the Construction Contract) and payment
obligations of Contractor under the Construction Contract strictly in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Construction Contract (except as expressly set
forth herein) (such obligations being collectively referred to herein as the
"Supported Obligations");

(ii) agrees that (A) if for any reason whatsoever Contractor
shall fail or be unable to perform or pay in full any of the Supported
Obligations as and when required or due, TECO will promptly perform or pay the
same without regard to any exercise or non-exercise by any Beneficiary of any
right, remedy, power or privilege under or in respect of the Construction
Contract, and (B) in the case of any extension of time of the performance,
payment or renewal of any of the Supported Obligations pursuant to the terms of
the Construction Contract and, if necessary, the Credit Documents, the same will
be promptly performed or paid in full when required or due in accordance with
the terms of such extension or renewal, in each case, except as set forth in
Section 2.1(c) hereof, by expending an aggregate amount up to the
then-applicable Undertaking Limit; and

(iii) agrees that if, notwithstanding the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 3.11 hereof or anything to the contrary herein,
enforcement of the liability of TECO hereunder for the full amount of the
Supported Obligations would be an unlawful or voidable transfer under any
applicable fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or any comparable
law, then the liability of TECO hereunder shall be reduced to the highest amount
for which such liability may then be enforced without giving rise to an unlawful
or voidable transfer under any such law.

(b) In fulfilling its obligations hereunder with respect to the
Supported Obligations, TECO hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees,
promises and agrees to perform and comply with the Construction Contract. The
words "perform and comply with" are used in their most comprehensive sense and
include without limitation (x) the payment of all

7
<PAGE>

costs and expenses with respect to the achievement of Final Acceptance of the
Project within the time and in the manner set forth in the Construction
Contract, (y) the payment, satisfaction or discharge of all Liens arising out
of, or relating to, any work associated with the Construction Contract or any
subcontracts related thereto that are or may be imposed upon or asserted against
the Project and (z) the defense and indemnification of the Beneficiaries against
all such Liens, whether arising from the furnishing of labor, materials,
supplies or equipment, from taxes, assessments, fees or other charges, from
injuries or damage to persons or property, or otherwise, in each case, except as
provided in clause (ii) below and Section 2.1(c), as and to the extent required
by the terms of the Construction Contract. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, TECO agrees:

(i) to obtain and maintain in favor of, and deliver to, the
Beneficiaries as security for the performance of its obligations hereunder the
revolving letter of credit referred to in Section 11.11 of the Construction
Contract having a stated amount at all times in accordance with Schedule 2
attached hereto;

(ii) to pay from TECO's own resources up to the then-applicable
Undertaking Limit, Schedule Liquidated Damages and Performance Liquidated
Damages as and when due under the Construction Contract; provided, however,
notwithstanding the limits on Schedule Liquidated Damages set forth in Section
11.07(c) of the Construction Contract applicable to Contractor, TECO shall be
obligated to pay Schedule Liquidated Damages without regard to any such limits
set forth in Section 11.07(c) of the Construction Contract; provided further,
however, in the event that the Schedule Liquidated Damages payable by Contractor
and TECO pursuant to the Construction Contract and this Section 2.1(b)(ii)
exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the Separated Contract Price, such amounts in
excess of such fifteen percent (15%) shall not be considered in determining
whether the limit of twenty five percent (25%) of the Separated Contract Price
for Schedule Liquidated Damages and Performance Liquidated Damages,
collectively, has been met; and

(iii) to cause Final Acceptance of the Project to occur on or
before the Required Final Acceptance Date in accordance with the terms of the
Construction Contract.

(c) TECO acknowledges and agrees that the Actual Construction Cost
will exceed the Pre-Bankruptcy EPC Cost. TECO further acknowledges and agrees
that: (x) Borrower shall not be liable for the difference between (i) the Actual
Construction Costs (less the amount of any change orders under the Construction
Contract increasing the Separated Contract Price entered into after November 30,
2001 in accordance with the Credit Agreement (other than those pending change
orders described in clause (b) of the definition of Pre-Bankruptcy EPC Cost))
and (ii) the sum of (A) the Pre-Bankruptcy EPC Cost plus (B) the aggregate
amount of the Retainage L/C Proceeds; (y) the sum of the amounts set forth on
Schedule 1 attached hereto reflects the estimated amount (as of the date hereof)
by which the Actual Construction Cost will exceed the sum of the Pre-Bankruptcy
EPC Cost plus the aggregate amount of Retainage L/C Proceeds; and (z) TECO shall
be liable to pay the actual amount by which the Actual Construction Cost (less
the amount of any change orders under the Construction Contract increasing the
Separated Contract Price entered into after November 30, 2001 in accordance with
the Credit Agreement (other than those pending change orders

8
<PAGE>

described in clause (b) of the definition of Pre-Bankruptcy EPC Cost)) exceeds
the sum of the Pre-Bankruptcy EPC Cost plus the aggregate amount of Retainage
L/C Proceeds.

(d) To implement the agreement set forth in clause (c) above, subject
to the following sentence, (i) not later than the last Banking Day of each month
commencing in February 2002, TECO shall be obligated to deposit into the account
referred to below an aggregate amount equal to the amount set forth on Schedule
1 attached hereto corresponding to such month, (ii) at such time, if ever, as
the amount by which the Actual Construction Cost (less the amount of any change
orders under the Construction Contract increasing the Separated Contract Price
entered into after November 30, 2001 in accordance with the Credit Agreement
(other than those pending change orders described in clause (b) of the
definition of Pre-Bankruptcy EPC Cost)) exceeds the sum of the Pre-Bankruptcy
EPC Cost plus the aggregate amount of Retainage L/C Proceeds by more than the
aggregate amount set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, TECO shall deposit
such excess amounts in the account referred to below as such excess amounts
become due and payable and use the proceeds thereof to pay any remaining amounts
due to Contractor, Subcontractors and any other Person to which Actual
Construction Costs are then due and owing, and (iii) at such time, if ever, that
TECO provides Administrative Agent evidence, satisfactory to Administrative
Agent (determination of which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
that the amount by which the Actual Construction Cost (less the amount of any
change orders under the Construction Contract increasing the Separated Contract
Price entered into after November 30, 2001 in accordance with the Credit
Agreement (other than those pending change orders described in clause (b) of the
definition of Pre-Bankruptcy EPC Cost)) exceeds the sum of the Pre-Bankruptcy
EPC Cost plus the aggregate amount of the Retainage L/C Proceeds is less than
the amounts set forth on Schedule 1 by more than $5,000,000, TECO and
Administrative Agent shall amend Schedule 1 to reflect any agreed upon
adjustments. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in any month
where funds are not being paid to Persons performing work included within the
"Scope of Work" described in the Construction Contract, TECO's obligation to pay
or deposit any amounts referred to in this Section 2.1(d) shall be deferred
until such date as payments to such Persons resume, at which time TECO shall
deposit all amounts deferred pursuant to this sentence into the account
described below. Within one Banking Day after the date hereof, TECO shall
establish an account with Depositary Agent into which all amounts to be paid by
TECO pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) shall be deposited. Concurrently therewith,
TECO shall execute a control agreement in favor of Administrative Agent granting
a first priority security interest in such account to Administrative Agent.
Provided no Event of Default exists, TECO shall have the right to withdraw
amounts in such account and advance such amounts to Borrower to pay Contractor,
Subcontractors and/or any other Person to which Actual Construction Costs are
then due and owing as and when amounts are due such Persons. At any time an
Event of Default exists, TECO shall have no rights of withdrawal with respect to
such account and, in any event, Administrative Agent's only rights with respect
to such account shall be to pay to Contractor, Subcontractors and/or any other
Person to which Actual Construction Costs are then due and owing with amounts in
such account. To the extent any amounts are remaining in such account after
Final Acceptance has been achieved, such amounts shall be paid to TECO in
accordance with TECO's instructions.

(e) Except as provided in clauses (c) and (d) of this Section 2.1, but
notwithstanding any other provision of this Undertaking to the contrary, the
aggregate amount expended by TECO in the performance of this Undertaking shall
not exceed the then-applicable Undertaking Limit.

2.2  Obligations Absolute and Unconditional.

(a) The obligations of TECO hereunder are primary obligations of TECO
and are an absolute, unconditional, continuing and irrevocable guaranty of
payment and performance of the Supported Obligations and not of collectibility
and are in no way conditioned on or contingent upon any attempt to enforce in
whole or in part Contractor's liabilities and obligations to the Beneficiaries.
If Contractor shall fail to pay or perform any of the Supported Obligations as
and when they are due or required, TECO shall forthwith perform or pay such
Supported Obligations (and in the case of any payment required hereunder, in
immediately available funds), and each such failure by Contractor to pay or
perform a Supported Obligation shall give rise to a separate cause of action
herewith, and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action
arises.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, the Beneficiaries may, at any
time and from time to time (whether or not after revocation or termination of
this Undertaking) without the consent of or notice to TECO, except such notice
as may be required by applicable law which cannot be waived or any notice
required hereunder, without incurring responsibility to TECO, without impairing
or releasing the obligations of TECO hereunder, upon or without any terms or
conditions and in whole or in part, (i) change the manner, place and terms of
payment or performance or change or extend the time of such payment or
performance of, renew, or alter any Supported Obligation, or any obligations and
liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly
in respect thereof or hereof or in any manner modify, amend or supplement the
terms of the Construction Contract, any documents, instruments or agreements
executed in connection therewith, and the undertaking herein made shall apply to
the Supported Obligations, as changed, extended, renewed, modified, amended,
supplemented or altered in any manner; (ii) exercise or refrain from exercising
any rights against Contractor or others (including TECO) or otherwise act or
refrain from acting; (iii) add or release any other guarantor from its
obligations without affecting or impairing the obligations of TECO hereunder;
(iv) settle or compromise any Supported Obligations and/or any obligations and
liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly
in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part
thereof to the payment of any obligations and liabilities which may be due to
the Beneficiaries or others; (v) sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize
upon or otherwise deal with in any manner or in any order any property by
whomsoever pledged or mortgaged to secure or howsoever securing the Supported
Obligations or any liabilities or obligations (including any of those hereunder)
incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof and/or any offset
thereagainst; (vi) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to
any obligations and liabilities of Contractor to the Beneficiaries under the
Construction Contract in the manner provided therein regardless of what
obligations and liabilities remain unpaid; (vii) consent to or waive any breach
of, or any act, omission or default under, the Construction Contract; and/or
(viii) act or fail to act in any manner referred to in this Undertaking which
may deprive TECO of its right to subrogation against Contractor or any other

10
<PAGE>

Person to recover full indemnity for any payments made pursuant to this
Undertaking or of its right of contribution against any other party.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Undertaking to the contrary, no amendment
to or modification of the Construction Contract resulting from the Banks', or
any agent acting on behalf of, or transferee of, the Banks acting as Owner
under, and as defined in, the Construction Contract (to the exclusion of TECO)
pursuant to remedies provided in the Credit Documents shall affect or modify the
Support Obligations in any manner without the prior written consent of TECO.

(c) No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of the Supported
Obligations or invalidity, irregularity, unenforceability or nonperfection of
any collateral therefor, shall affect, impair, or be a defense to this
Undertaking, which is a primary obligation of TECO.

(d) This is a continuing Undertaking and all obligations to which it
applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to
have been created in reliance hereon. In the event that, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 2.2(a) hereof, this Undertaking shall be deemed revocable
in accordance with applicable law, then to the extent permitted by applicable
law any such revocation shall become effective only upon receipt by the
Beneficiaries of written notice of revocation signed by TECO. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, no revocation or termination hereof shall affect in
any manner rights arising under this Undertaking with respect to Supported
Obligations arising prior to receipt by the Beneficiaries of written notice of
such revocation or termination and the sole effect of revocation and termination
hereof shall be to exclude from this Undertaking Supported Obligations
thereafter arising which are unconnected with Supported Obligations theretofore
arising or transactions theretofore entered into.

(e) Except as otherwise provided by law or by the terms of the
Construction Contract, each payment to be made by TECO to, or on behalf of, the
Beneficiaries hereunder shall be made without deduction or withholding for or on
account of Taxes. If such deduction or withholding is so required, TECO shall,
upon notice thereof from any Beneficiary, (i) pay the amount required to be
deducted or withheld to the appropriate authorities before penalties attach
thereto or interest accrues thereon (including deductions from amounts payable
under this Section 2.2(e)), (ii) on or before the 30th day after payment of such
amount, forward to such Beneficiary an official receipt evidencing such payment
(or a certified copy thereof), and (iii) in the case of any such deduction or
withholding, forthwith pay to such Beneficiary such additional amount as may be
necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by such Beneficiary,
free and clear of such Taxes, including any Taxes on such additional amount, is
equal to the amount that such Beneficiary would have received had there been no
such deduction or withholding.

2.3  Waiver.

(a) Subject to Section 2.3(b) and the last sentence of Section 2.2(a),
to the extent permitted by applicable law, TECO hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives and relinquishes all rights and remedies accorded by
applicable law to sureties or guarantors and agrees not to assert or take
advantage of any such rights or remedies, including (i) any right to

11
<PAGE>

require the Beneficiaries to proceed against Contractor or any other Person or
to proceed against or exhaust any security held by the Beneficiaries at any time
or to pursue any other remedy in any Beneficiary's power before proceeding
against TECO, (ii) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack
of power or authority, dissolution, merger, bankruptcy, termination or
disability of Contractor or any other Person or the failure of any Beneficiary
to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or
any other proceeding) of Contractor or any other Person, (iii) promptness,
diligence, demand, presentment, protest and notice of any kind (other than
notices required hereunder or under the Construction Contract or under the
Credit Documents), including notice of the existence, creation or incurring of
any new or additional indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action
on the part of Contractor, Beneficiary, any endorser or creditor of Contractor
or TECO or on the part of any other person under this or any other instrument in
connection with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness held by the
Beneficiaries in connection with any Supported Obligations, (iv) any defense
based upon an election of remedies by the Beneficiaries, including an election
to proceed by non-judicial rather than judicial foreclosure, which destroys or
otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of TECO, the right of TECO to proceed
against Contractor for reimbursement, or both, (v) any defense based on any
offset against any amounts which may be owed by any Person to TECO for any
reason whatsoever, (vi) any defense based on any act, failure to act, delay or
omission whatsoever on the part of Borrower or Contractor or the failure by
Borrower or Contractor to do any act or thing or to observe or perform any
covenant, condition or agreement to be observed or performed by it under the
Construction Contract or the Credit Documents, (vii) any defense based upon any
statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be
neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the
principal, (viii) any defense, setoff or counterclaim which may at any time be
available to or asserted by Borrower or Contractor against the Beneficiaries or
any other Person under the Construction Contract, the Credit Agreement or any
other Credit Document (other than, subject to Section 6.14, defense of payment
of the applicable amounts), (ix) any duty on the part of the Beneficiaries to
disclose to TECO any facts the Beneficiaries may now or hereafter know about
Contractor, regardless of whether the Beneficiaries have reason to believe that
any such facts materially increase the risk beyond that which TECO intends to
assume, or have reason to believe that such facts are unknown to TECO, or have a
reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to TECO, since TECO
acknowledges that TECO is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of
the financial condition of Contractor and of all circumstances bearing on the
risk of non-payment of any obligations and liabilities hereby guaranteed, (x)
any defense arising because of any Beneficiary's election, in any proceeding
instituted under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section
1111(b)(2) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (xi) any defense based upon any
borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code and (xii) any other circumstance (including any statute of
limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the
Beneficiaries that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or
discharge of, any guarantor or surety (other than, subject to Section 6.14,
defense of payment of the applicable amounts).

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Undertaking to the contrary
but subject to the following sentence, TECO shall be entitled to assert the
defense that payment or performance is not then due and owing in accordance with
the terms of the Construction Contract. TECO hereby agrees not to assert or take
advantage of and waives all rights hereunder

12
<PAGE>

with respect to any Owner Caused Delay except to the extent the same actually
and demonstrably result directly (i) from a breach by third parties of their
obligations under Project Documents or (ii) from "force majeure events"
affecting such Persons (other than claims of force majeure events by Persons
arising out of Contractor's acts or failure to act) or (iii) from the Banks', or
any agent acting on behalf of, or transferee of, the Banks acting as Owner
under, and as defined in, the Construction Contract (to the exclusion of TECO)
pursuant to remedies provided in the Credit Documents.

2.4 Subrogation. For so long as this Undertaking or the El Dorado
Undertaking remains in effect, except as provided below, (a) TECO shall not
exercise any right of subrogation or enforce any remedy which it or the
Beneficiaries now have or may hereafter have against Contractor in respect of
the Supported Obligations, and, except as provided below, will not claim the
benefit of any rights to, or seek to participate in, any security now or
hereafter held by the Beneficiaries from Contractor and (b) TECO shall not
enforce any claim, right or remedy which TECO may now have or hereafter acquire
against Contractor that arises hereunder, from the existence or enforcement of
this Undertaking and/or from the performance by TECO hereunder, including any
claim, remedy or right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution,
indemnification, or participation in any claim, right or remedy of the
Beneficiaries against Contractor, or any security which the Beneficiaries now
have or hereafter acquire, whether or not such claim, right or remedy arises in
equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise; provided,
however, TECO shall be entitled to receive reimbursement from Contractor, Enron,
any Subcontractor or from Borrower (in the case of Borrower, solely from funds
provided by Contractor, Enron or any Subcontractor and solely to the extent such
amounts represent amounts previously paid by TECO under this Undertaking) or
evidence of the right to such reimbursement (in the form of a note or other
instrument), and, notwithstanding any provision of the Credit Documents or the
Bridge Loan Documents to the contrary, Borrower shall be entitled to assign to
TECO its rights against Contractor, Enron or any Subcontractor, in each case
solely in respect of, and to the extent it relates to, amounts paid or
obligations performed by TECO under this Undertaking. Subject to any such rights
being assigned to TECO as referred to in the preceding sentence, nothing herein
shall affect the right of Borrower to enforce any rights or claims it may have
against Contractor or Enron or to terminate the Construction Contract, in each
case subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the foregoing proviso, prior to the date on which remedies have
been exercised under the Credit Documents, the consequence of which is that TECO
no longer directly or indirectly owns any interest in Borrower or the Project,
TECO shall not have the right to sue, claim against, institute any action
against or otherwise enforce any right to seek the reimbursement described above
from Borrower for amounts paid or obligations performed by TECO under this
Undertaking.

2.5 Bankruptcy. For so long as this Undertaking or the El Dorado
Undertaking remains in effect, TECO shall not, and shall not permit any of its
subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent,
commence, or join with any other Person in commencing, any bankruptcy,
reorganization, or insolvency proceeding against Borrower or Contractor. The
obligations of TECO under this Undertaking shall not be altered, limited or
affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement of Borrower
or Contractor, or by any

13
<PAGE>

defense which Borrower or Contractor may have by reason of any order, decree or
decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

2.6 Actions by Administrative Agent. Except as set forth in the definition
of Undertaking Letter of Credit, Sections 2.1(b)(z), 2.1(c) or 2.1(d), Article
IV, Article V or Article VI of this Undertaking, Administrative Agent shall have
no right to enforce any rights or remedies under this Undertaking unless and
until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; provided that
nothing in this Section 2.6 shall impact the rights and remedies of the Banks
under the Collateral Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Undertaking, nothing in this Section 2.6 shall in any way affect, modify or
limit the waivers and agreements of TECO set forth in Section 2.2(b), 2.2(d),
2.2(e), 2.3(a), 2.4 or 2.5 of this Undertaking regardless of whether any Event
of Default exists.

obtained or where the failure to obtain such consent or authorization could not
reasonably be expected to have a TECO Material Adverse Effect. This Undertaking
and each other document to which TECO is a party relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly executed and delivered by
TECO and constitute, and each other such document to which it is to become a
party relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby will
upon execution and delivery thereof by TECO and the other parties thereto (if

<PAGE>

Undertaking and each other document to which it is or is to become a party to
complete the transactions contemplated hereby and the making by TECO of any
payments hereunder or under any other document to which it is a party relating
to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby will not violate any
applicable law or any material contractual obligation of TECO and will not
result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the
properties or revenues of TECO pursuant to any applicable law or any such
contractual obligation except, in each case, where such violation, creation or
imposition could not reasonably be expected to have a TECO Material Adverse
Effect.

3.4 No Proceeding or Litigation. No litigation or proceeding of or before
any Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of TECO, threatened
in writing against TECO with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Undertaking or any other document to which TECO is or is to become a party

such litigation or proceeding could not reasonably be expected to have a TECO

necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by TECO of this
Undertaking and the performance of its obligations hereunder have been obtained

TECO and its Significant Subsidiaries heretofore delivered by TECO to
Administrative Agent were true, correct and complete in all material respects,
did not fail to disclose any material liabilities, whether direct or contingent,

such Significant Subsidiary, as the case may be, in each case as of the date
delivered and were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Since the date of the most
recent such financial statements, there has been no material adverse change in
the business, operations, property, assets or financial condition of TECO or its
Significant Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

which such information was provided. The information referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence furnished to Administrative Agent or any Bank on
or prior to the date hereof, taken as a whole, as updated or supplemented from
time to time, is true and correct in all material respects as of the date

any fact which could reasonably be expected to have a TECO Material Adverse
Effect.

to the PBGC or an ERISA Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for
premiums due in the ordinary course). Assuming that the credit extended

ERISA, neither the execution of this Undertaking nor the consummation of the

30 days after the earlier of the date that TECO becomes aware thereof or
receives written notice thereof from Beneficiary.

(d) Breach of Terms of Agreement. TECO shall fail to perform or

judgment, the execution of which is effectively stayed within 30 days after its
entry but only for 30 days after the date on which such stay is terminated or

8.1.3        Outage Start and End Dates . The start and end dates of all outages will be mutually agreed between the
Parties. Contractor shall be flexible and work with the Owner towards agreeing on the start and end dates of outages.
8.1.4        Blank .
8.1.5        Concurrent
Outages . Except as set forth in this Section 8.1.5, Contractor shall not plan an outage for any Unit at Morgantown or Chalk Point for a time when any other Unit at the same Facility is also out of service for a planned outage by Owner
or Contractor. In the specific case of Chalk Point Owner shall allow one concurrent outage, prior to the tie-in outage, for a time and duration to be mutually agreed by the Parties. Contractor shall not schedule an outage for any Unit at
Dickerson, if two other Units at Dickerson are also out of service for a planned outage by Owner or Contractor. Owner shall provide six (6) months advance notice of outages planned by Owner. Contractor shall provide six
(6) months advance notice of outages planned by Contractor that are not in or in accordance with the Approved Project Schedule.


38








8.1.6        Immovable
Milestones . There shall be no change to the following milestones in Exhibit 15:
8.1.6.1        Provisional Acceptance for each FGD System shall occur not later than one hundred five (105) days after the first day of the last Scheduled Outage Period set forth in the Approved
Project Schedule for the final tie-in outage for that System, and Substantial Completion for each FGD System shall occur not later than ninety (90) days after the date of Provisional Acceptance for that System;
8.1.6.2        Owner permitting completion and construction full release shall occur
not later than September 1, 2007;
8.1.6.3        Required dates
for operating utilities interface as described in Exhibit 15;
8.1.6.4        Permitting documents submission date as described in Section 6.2.3.2;
8.1.6.5        The Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date as set forth in 8.1.1;
8.1.6.6        Owner’s schedule commitments as set forth in Section 5.3;

8.1.6.7        With respect to each FGD System, the Work included in
the milestone identified as “Ready for Flue Gas to Scrubber” in Exhibit 15 shall be completed not later than December 31, 2009.
8.2        Schedule Guarantee . As further provided in this Section 8.2, liquidated damages will accrue for certain extended and unplanned
outages, and for delay in achieving any Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date, the Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date, or Guaranteed Final Completion Date. Such liquidated damages shall be treated as Guarantee Costs pursuant to
Section 11.3.
8.2.1        Work Progress and Completion .

8.2.1.1        General . Contractor will schedule, report
and perform the Work according to the Approved Project Schedule. Contractor will provide Owner with a Progress Report on the fifteenth (15th ) day of each month during the performance of the Work.
8.2.1.2        Maximum Outage Period . Contractor acknowledges that
Owner will incur significant damages and liabilities if any of the Units is taken out of operation for any period longer than the Scheduled Outage Period for such Unit (as will be reflected in the Approved Project



39









Schedule). Accordingly, all Work that must be performed while a Unit is out of operation will be performed by Contractor during normal maintenance outages scheduled by Owner or during the
Scheduled Outage Period for such Unit. Subject only to adjustment by Change Order, the Contractor’s exact compliance with the Scheduled Outage Period set forth in the Approved Project Schedule is crucial to Owner’s business and
Contractor has planned, organized and coordinated the Work to fully and exactly comply with such Scheduled Outage Period. Because of the significant economic harm that Owner will suffer if the Contractor does not comply with the Scheduled
Outage Period, Owner and Contractor agree that if, during an outage, Contractor is not performing the Work in accordance with the time limits for a Scheduled Outage Period and Owner can reasonably deduce, during the outage, that Contractor will not
complete the Work necessary within the Scheduled Outage Period, then Owner may utilize separate contractors to perform all or part of the Work necessary to complete such Work within the Scheduled Outage Period. Liquidated damages for such
losses shall accrue for each day that the Contractor does not start and finish the work in exact accordance with the Scheduled Outage Period (such payment with respect to each Unit, the “Excessive Outage Payments” ) in the following
amounts:
Morgantown; $125,000 per Unit per day
Dickerson; $70,000 per Unit per day
Chalk Point; $100,000 per Unit per day
Owner shall use its best efforts to avoid
interference with the Contractor’s Work by the Owner and Owner’s Separate Contractors during the Scheduled Outage Period. Contractor understands and agrees that it shall not interfere with and shall cooperate with the Owner and
Owner’s Separate Contractors at the Project Site to fully perform the Work with no or minimal impact to any other party.
8.2.1.2.1    Amounts Reasonable . The Parties agree that the terms, conditions and amounts fixed as liquidated damages
pursuant to Section 8.2.1.2 for Excessive Outage Payments are reasonable, considering the actual losses that Owner will incur if the outage of a Unit exceeds the Scheduled Outage Period for such Unit. The amounts of these liquidated damages are
agreed upon and fixed hereunder by the Parties because of the difficulty of ascertaining the exact amount of losses that Owner will actually incur in such event, and the Parties agree that such amounts are a reasonable estimate of Owner’s
probable loss (and are not a penalty) and that such amounts will be applicable regardless of the actual losses incurred by Owner.


40








8.2.1.2.2        Bonus for Early Completion . If the Contractor finishes its Work during an outage before the end date of the Scheduled
Outage Period, then for each day Owner is able to generate power from the affected Unit Contractor shall receive a bonus as follows:
Morgantown:        $ 35,000 per Unit per day
Dickerson:             $15,000 per Unit per day
Chalk Point:           $25,000 per
Unit per day
8.2.1.2.3        Payment of Excessive Outage Payments . Owner will invoice Contractor for any Excessive Outage Payments due under
Section 8.2.1.2 on a monthly basis, and Contractor will be assessed the undisputed portion of each such invoice in full within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt. If, subject to Section 11.3, an undisputed amount remains
unpaid for more than five (5) days after receipt of notice from Owner that the amount is overdue, Owner may deduct any such amounts due as Excessive Outage Payments from any unpaid amounts owed by Owner to Contractor under this Agreement.

8.2.2    Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date . Contractor guarantees that
Provisional Acceptance of each of the Systems will occur on or before the “ Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date “ for each System as set forth in the Approved Project Schedule, subject only to adjustment by Change Order pursuant
to Article 19 of this Agreement.
8.2.3    Late Provisional Acceptance
Payments . If Provisional Acceptance of a System does not occur on or before the Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date for such System, as adjusted by Change Order pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, liquidated damages shall
accrue in the amounts provided below ( “Late Provisional Acceptance Payments” ):
8.2.3.1        Before 23:59 on December 31, 2009 for the FGD Systems. In the event that Provisional Acceptance of an FGD System is not achieved by a Guaranteed
Provisional Acceptance Date that is prior to 23:59 on December 31, 2009, then the following Late Provisional Acceptance Payment shall apply for each day beginning with the day after the Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date and ending on the
earlier of (i) 23:59 on December 31, 2009, or (ii) the date Provisional Acceptance is achieved:
Dickerson – $25,000 per FGD System per day
Chalk Point – $25,000 per FGD System per day

Morgantown – $25,000 per FGD System per day


41








8.2.3.2        After 23:59 on
December 31, 2009 for FGD Systems. The Late Provisional Acceptance Payments set forth below shall apply in the following circumstances. In the event that the Milestone described as “Ready for Flue Gas to Scrubber” in Exhibit
15 for an FGD System is not achieved before 23:59 on December 31, 2009, then the stated Late Provisional Acceptance Payment shall apply for each day beginning with January 1, 2010, and ending with the day before such Milestone is
achieved. In the event that Provisional Acceptance of an FGD System is not achieved by a Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date that is after December 31, 2009 then, unless reduced pursuant to Section 8.2.3.4, the stated Late
Provisional Acceptance Payment shall apply for each day beginning with the Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date and ending with the day before Provisional Acceptance is achieved. The Late Provisional Acceptance Payments applicable to the FGD
Systems at each Facility are as follows:
Dickerson – $100,000 per FGD System per day
Chalk Point – $100,000 per FGD System per day
Morgantown – $125,000 per FGD System per day
In the event that there is delay in both achievement of the “Ready for Flue Gas to Scrubber” milestone for a
System and achievement of Provisional Acceptance for the same System, then such Late Provisional Acceptance Payments shall apply without duplication. For example, if completion of the “Ready for Flue Gas to Scrubber” milestone for the
System is delayed for ten days (i.e., such milestone is not achieved until January 11, 2010), and Provisional Acceptance of the System is delayed by fifteen days (i.e., from a Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date of February 28, 2010
until an actual date of Provisional Acceptance of March 16, 2010) then Late Provisional Acceptance Payments will accrue for the ten days of delay in achieving the milestone (from January 1 through 10), but will not accrue for the first ten
days of delay in achieving Provisional Acceptance (from February 28 through March 10). Under this example, Late Provisional Acceptance Payments will accrue for the remaining five days of delay in achieving Provisional Acceptance, from
March 11 to March 15.
8.2.3.3        Blank .

8.2.3.4        Reduced Late Provisional Acceptance Payments
Period . In the event that Provisional Acceptance of an FGD System is not achieved on or before the Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date, but such Provisional Acceptance would have been achieved if not for an initial SO2 removal test
showing an SO2 removal percentage below 98% but greater than 94%, then the following Late Provisional Acceptance Payments shall apply for each day beginning on the later of (i) January 1, 2010 or (ii) the date of the initial SO2
removal test, and ending on the day before Provisional Acceptance is achieved:


42








8.2.3.4.1        If the initial
test result is less than 98% and greater than 97%, then the Late Provisional Acceptance Payment shall be $30,000 per FGD System per day for the first 30 days, and the full amount set forth in Section 8.2.3.2 for each day thereafter.

8.2.3.4.2        If the initial test result is less than or equal to 97% and
greater than 96%, then the Late Provisional Acceptance Payments shall be $30,000 per FGD System per day for the first 26 days, and the full amount set forth in Section 8.2.3.2 for each day thereafter.
8.2.3.4.3        If the initial test result is less than or equal to 96% and
greater than 95%, then the Late Provisional Acceptance Payments shall be $30,000 per FGD System per day for the first 19 days, and the full amount set forth in Section 8.2.3.2 for each day thereafter.
8.2.3.4.4        If the initial test result is less than or equal to 95% and
greater than 94%, then the Late Provisional Acceptance Payments shall be $30,000 per FGD System per day for the first 10 days, and the full amount set forth in Section 8.2.3.2 for each day thereafter.
8.2.3.5        Amounts Reasonable . The Parties agree that the terms,
conditions and amounts fixed as liquidated damages pursuant to Section 8.2.3 for Late Provisional Acceptance Payments are reasonable, considering the actual losses that Owner will incur if Contractor fails to achieve Provisional Acceptance of a
System by the Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date for such System. The amounts of these liquidated damages are agreed upon and fixed hereunder by the Parties because of the difficulty of ascertaining the exact amount of losses that Owner will
actually incur in such event, and the Parties agree that such amounts are a reasonable estimate of Owner’s probable loss (and are not a penalty) and that such amounts will be applicable regardless of the actual losses incurred by Owner. The
receipt of any such liquidated damages will not affect, nor be affected by, Owner’s rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 23.4 or 23.5.
8.2.3.6        Payment of Late Provisional Acceptance Payments . Owner will
invoice Contractor for any Late Provisional Acceptance Payments due under Section 8.2.3 on a monthly basis, and Contractor will be assessed the undisputed portion of each such invoice in full within thirty (30) calendar days of its
receipt. If, subject to Section 11.3, an


43








undisputed amount remains unpaid for more than five (5) days after receipt of notice
from Owner that the amount is overdue, Owner may deduct any such amounts due as Late Provisional Acceptance Payments from any unpaid amounts owed by Owner to Contractor under this Agreement.
8.2.4        Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date . Contractor guarantees
that Substantial Completion of each of the Systems will occur on or before the “Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date” for each System. The Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date for each FGD System at each Facility shall be
the date that is ninety (90) days after date on which such System achieves Provisional Acceptance.
8.2.4.1        Late Substantial Completion Payments . If Substantial Completion of the Work required in connection with a Facility does not occur on or before the Guaranteed Substantial
Completion Date for such Facility, then subject only to adjustment of the Substantial Completion Date by Change Order pursuant to Article 19 of this Agreement, Contractor hereby agrees to be assessed to Owner, $500 per calendar day for each
calendar day after such Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date until Substantial Completion of all Work required in connection with such System is achieved (“ Late Substantial Completion Payments ”).
8.2.4.2        Amounts Reasonable and Exclusive Remedy for Delay . The
Parties agree that the terms, conditions and amounts fixed as liquidated damages pursuant to Section 8.2.4.1 for Late Substantial Completion Payments are reasonable, considering the actual losses that Owner will incur if Contractor fails to
achieve Substantial Completion for a System by the Guaranteed Substantial Completion Date for such System. The amounts of these liquidated damages are agreed upon and fixed hereunder by the Parties because of the difficulty of ascertaining the
exact amount of losses that Owner will actually incur in such event, and the Parties agree that such amounts are a reasonable estimate of Owner’s probable loss (and are not a penalty) and that such amounts will be applicable regardless of the
actual losses incurred by Owner. The Parties agree that the Late Provisional Acceptance Payments, Excessive Outage Payments, and Late Substantial Completion Payments are the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Owner for damages it incurs due
to delay in completing outages or achieving Provisional Acceptance or Substantial Completion; notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Owner reserves all of its rights and remedies under Section 6.10, Article 7, Article 14, Article 23
and Article 28.
8.2.4.3        Payment of Late Substantial
Completion Payments . Owner will invoice Contractor for any Late Substantial Completion Payments due under Section 8.2.4 on a weekly basis, and Contractor will



44









be assessed the undisputed portion of each such invoice in full within thirty (30) calendar days of its receipt. If, subject to Section 11.3, an undisputed amount remains unpaid
for more than five (5) days after receipt of notice from Owner that the amount is overdue, Owner may deduct any amounts due as Late Substantial Completion Payments from any unpaid amounts owed by Owner to Contractor.
8.2.5        Guaranteed Final Completion Date . Contractor guarantees that
Final Completion of the Work at each Facility will be achieved by no later than ninety (90) days after Substantial Completion of the Work required in connection with the last System at that Facility (such date, the “Guaranteed Final
Completion Date” for each Facility).
8.2.6        Late
Final Completion Payments . If Final Completion of the Work required in connection with a Facility does not occur on or before the Guaranteed Final Completion Date for such Facility, then subject only to adjustment of the Final Completion Date
by Change Order pursuant to Article 19 of this Agreement, Contractor hereby agrees to pay to Owner, $10,000 per calendar day for each calendar day after such Guaranteed Final Completion Date until Final Completion of all Work required in
connection with such Facility is achieved (“ Late Final Completion Payments ”).
8.2.6.1        Amounts Reasonable and Exclusive Remedy for Delay . The Parties agree that the terms, conditions and amounts fixed as liquidated damages pursuant to Section 8.2.6 for Late
Final Completion Payments are reasonable, considering the actual losses that Owner will incur if Contractor fails to achieve Final Completion for a System by the Guaranteed Final Completion Date for such System. The amounts of these liquidated
damages are agreed upon and fixed hereunder by the Parties because of the difficulty of ascertaining the exact amount of losses that Owner will actually incur in such event, and the Parties agree that such amounts are a reasonable estimate of
Owner’s probable loss (and are not a penalty) and that such amounts will be applicable regardless of the actual losses incurred by Owner. The Parties agree that the Late Provisional Acceptance Payments, Excessive Outage Payments, and Late
Final Completion Payments are the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Owner for damages it incurs due to delay in completing outages or achieving Provisional Acceptance or Final Completion; notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Owner
reserves all of its rights and remedies under Section 6.10, Article 7, Article 14, Article 23 and Article 28.
8.2.6.2        Payment of Late Final Completion Payments . Owner will invoice Contractor for any Late Final Completion Payments due under Section 8.2.6 on a weekly basis, and Contractor
will pay be assessed the undisputed portion of each such invoice in full within thirty (30)



45









calendar days of its receipt. If, subject to Section 11.3, an undisputed amount remains unpaid for more than five (5) days after receipt of notice from Owner that the amount is
overdue, Owner may deduct any amounts due as Late Final Completion Payments from any unpaid amounts owed by Owner to Contractor.
8.2.7        Full Program Completion . Once the Contractor has successfully achieved Final Completion of all of its Work at all of the Project Sites, then it
will deliver a notice of completion of the Project (the “Notice of Project Completion”) to the Owner for verification. Owner shall, within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice, either approve or validate the notice or
provide a specific list of the area or areas in which it believes there are remaining Punch List items to be completed that have not been bought-down by mutual agreement pursuant to Section 17.5. Existence of any Punch List items that have
not been bought-down at a Facility shall be grounds for rejection of the “Notice of Project Completion.”
8.2.8        Reduction of Liquidated Damages Based on Delayed Permitting. Should issuance of a permit that is listed in Exhibit 4 as the responsibility of Contractor be delayed beyond the
scheduled date indicated in Exhibit 15 for issuance of such permit, Contractor shall promptly prepare for Owner’s review a revised schedule accelerating such work activities as are reasonably necessary to address the impact of such delay so
that the immovable milestones may be completed in accordance with Section 8.1.6. After review and discussion of the Contractor’s proposed revised schedule on an Open Book basis, Owner shall enter a Change Order adjusting the Target
Cost in accordance with Section 19.14 so as to equitably compensate Contractor for any additional Direct Costs that are Directly Caused by such acceleration. Should Owner fail to issue such a Change Order then, to the extent that such
failure is the Direct Cause of a delay in (i) achieving Provisional Acceptance pursuant to Section 8.2.2, (ii) achieving Substantial Completion pursuant to Section 8.2.4 or (ii) achieving Final Completion pursuant to
Section 8.2.5:
8.2.8.1        the liquidated damages applicable
to the days of delay Directly Caused by the failure of Owner to issue a reasonable Change Order in accordance with Section 19.14 shall be calculated using one-half (50%) of the daily rate that would otherwise be applicable under Sections
8.2.3.1, 8.2.3.2, 8.2.3.4, 8.2.4.1 and 8.2.6; and
8.2.8.2        the
total amount of liquidated damages payable by Contractor for delay Directly Caused by failure of Owner to issue a reasonable Change Order pursuant to Section 19.14 shall not exceed the following:
8.2.8.2.1        Five Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars
($5,250,000) for all Systems at Morgantown;


46








8.2.8.2.2        Three Million
Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,850,000) for all Systems at Chalk Point; and
8.2.8.2.3        Two Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,100,000) for all Systems at Dickerson.
8.3        Schedules .    Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 apply to the Approved Project Schedule:
8.3.1        Schedule Software . The schedule has been developed utilizing “Project Planner” project management system software by
Primavera. Contractor shall submit subsequent monthly updates, in both hard copy and diskette format at the lowest level of detail.
8.3.2        Activity Coding . The schedule has been developed using a detailed “work breakdown structure” (“WBS”) for activity coding.

8.3.3        Level 3 Detail . The subsequent monthly updates of the Approved
Project Schedule shall contain a level of detail consistent with a Level 3 schedule. The subsequent updates of the Approved Project Schedule for each Facility will contain at minimum a specific activity for each group of similar engineering
deliverables, material procurement activity, group of similar site deliverables, and work that interfaces with others. The subsequent updates shall also contain specific construction activities for the Work, consistent with the detail afforded
by the work breakdown structure.
8.3.4        Schedule
Updates . On a monthly basis, Contractor shall submit to Owner on the tenth (10 th) day of each calendar month an update of the Approved Project Schedule. This submittal shall be by an electronic transfer method approved by Owner. The updated schedule shall identify any changes in
Contractor’s scheduling logic and shall show the status of all activities relative to:
Completion dates

Estimate man-hours
Actual man-hours
Percent complete
Estimated quantities
Actual quantities
8.4        Work Operations . Contractor shall provide Owner, in a timely and convenient fashion, all information regarding Work
operations, sequence of Work including work of Subcontractors, breakdown of the Work into individual activities with estimated durations, logical relationships in the schedule for the Work, and descriptions of critical path and non-critical path
activities, and monthly schedule updates as required.


47








8.5        Recovery Schedule . If, in the
reasonable opinion of Owner after considering Contractor’s monthly Progress Report and the facts and information known to Owner, Contractor’s Work on critical path activities should fall behind the Approved Project Schedule by greater than
one week, the parties will meet to discuss appropriate remedial actions. Based on these discussions, Contractor shall, at Owner’s reasonable request, develop a recovery schedule for review and acceptance by Owner. In order to achieve
the recovery schedule, Contractor agrees to take some or all of the following actions: increase manpower, increase Project Work periods, and/or increase concurrency in such quantities and crafts as shall substantially eliminate the backlog of
Work. The additional costs of such action shall be treated as Allocable Costs under Section 11.5. This recovery schedule, once approved by Owner, shall be incorporated into the Approved Project Schedule and maintained until the interim
schedule milestones in question are accomplished.
8.6        Critical Schedule
Situation . If, in the reasonable opinion of Owner after consideration of Contractor’s monthly Progress Report and the facts and information known to it, Contractor’s Work on the critical path activities necessary for Provisional
Acceptance of a System fall behind the Approved Project Schedule by greater than one week, and should the Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date for such System be less than nine (9) months away (a “Critical Schedule
Situation”), then the parties will immediately meet to discuss appropriate remedial actions. Based on these discussions, Contractor shall develop a recovery schedule for review and acceptance by Owner. In order to achieve the
recovery schedule, Contractor agrees to take some or all of the following actions: increase manpower, increase Work periods, and/or increase concurrency in such quantities and crafts as shall substantially eliminate the backlog of
Work. This recovery schedule, once approved by Owner, shall be incorporated into the Approved Project Schedule and maintained until the delay is eliminated.
8.7        Contractor Responsible for Schedule . Owner’s review and approval of schedules specified within the Contract Documents shall not relieve
Contractor of its responsibility for accomplishing the Work according to the Contract Documents. Omissions and errors in the Approved Project Schedule shall not excuse performance less than that required by the Contract Documents. Owner’s
approval of Contractor certified and submitted schedules in no way makes Owner an insurer of the success of those schedules or liable for time or cost overruns resulting from shortcomings in such schedules.
9. KEY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS
9.1                 Personnel Resources .
9.1.1        Key Personnel . The Parties will designate a certain number of Contractor employees as “Key Personnel” . Exhibit 7
identifies individuals designated as Key Personnel as of the Effective Date and a Project organization chart. In addition, any personnel identified on Exhibit 7 shall be considered Key Personnel, regardless of any statement set forth in this
Agreement. The Key



48









Personnel will be highly qualified and capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of their positions, and Contractor will cause each of them to be primarily Dedicated to the Project. The
Parties may agree to change the Contractor personnel and/or positions designated as Key Personnel. Contractor shall guarantee that Key Personnel shall be dedicated, devoted and assigned to Work applicable to such personnel’s discipline at
each such person’s assigned Facility for as long as and for the duration that their discipline is needed to complete the Work ( “Dedicated” ).
Contractor acknowledges that the presence of certain Key Personnel at the Facilities is critical to the Project and agrees
to make any requested Key Personnel available at the Facilities upon Owner’s reasonable request. Such request will be provided to Contractor at least thirty (30) days before the presence of Key Personnel is required, or, in the case
of specialists to be identified by agreement of the Parties, fourteen (14) days; provided that where less than the required notice is provided, Contractor shall use reasonable efforts to make such Key Personnel available.
9.1.2        Departure of Key Personnel . Contractor shall be deemed in
default of this Agreement if Contractor breaches Section 9.1.1, except (i) where a Key Personnel leaves his or her employment for reasons that are beyond the reasonable control of Contractor (e.g., retirement, resignation, death,
disability, illegal or wrongful activity, etc), (ii) where a change in the person identified as a Key Personnel is agreed to by Owner in accordance with Section 9.1.4, or (iii) where a person identified as a Key Personnel is
transferred due to demonstrable personal hardship of the Key Personnel.
9.1.3        Assignment of Key Personnel . Before assigning an individual as a Key Personnel, Contractor will (i) notify Owner of the proposed assignment, (ii) introduce the
individual to the Owner’s Authorized Representative (and provide such representative with the opportunity to interview the individual), and (iii) provide Owner with a résumé and other information requested by Owner about the
individual. If Owner objects to the proposed assignment for any reason that is not unlawful, Contractor will not assign the individual as a Key Personnel and will promptly propose to Owner another highly qualified individual to serve in such
position.
9.1.4        Replacement of Key Personnel . Key
Personnel may not be transferred or re-assigned until a suitable replacement has been approved by Owner. Any replacement of Key Personnel, whether requested by Owner or Contractor, must be conducted in accordance with a mutually agreed upon
transition plan in accordance with Section 9.2. If any Key Personnel leaves his or her employment with Contractor for reasons that are beyond the reasonable control of Contractor, Contractor may temporarily replace such person, for a
period not to exceed sixty (60) days, with a Qualified Person without Owner’s approval until a permanent replacement has been identified to and approved by Owner. For purposes of this Section, a “Qualified Person”
shall mean a person of equal or greater education and experience, or as otherwise approved by



49









Owner. Owner’s approval of replacements for Key Personnel will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Parties agree that promotion will be acceptable grounds for replacing
Key Personnel provided that Contractor first identifies a replacement and such replacement is pre-approved by Owner.
9.1.5        Key Personnel of Subcontractors . Owner’s ultimate right to replace an employee of Contractor includes employees of its Subcontractors. Owner shall have the right to
instruct Contractor to remove any of its employees or its Subcontractors’ employees from the Project Site or the Work if Owner determines in its reasonable discretion and for reasons that are not unlawful that the continued assignment to the
Project of such personnel is not in the best interest of Owner. Owner’s Authorized Representative may request by notice that Contractor remove and replace any such person with another qualified individual. After receipt of such
notice, Contractor will remove, or require that its Subcontractor remove such person from the Project and replace such person with personnel possessing qualifications and skills appropriate to the position.
9.1.5.1        For Key Personnel, in a safety or emergency situation, such
personnel shall be removed immediately, and replaced as soon as practicable. In all other instances, Key Personnel shall be removed and replaced within 30 calendar days of Owner’s notice.
9.1.5.2        For non-Key Personnel, in a safety or emergency situation, such
personnel shall be removed immediately, and replaced as soon as practicable. In all other instances, non-Key Personnel shall be removed and replaced within 30 calendar days of Owner’s notice.
9.2        Contractor Personnel Transition Plan .
9.2.1        Notice of Departure of Key Personnel . Contractor will notify
Owner promptly upon determining that any Key Personnel will no longer be serving in such person’s position. Where practicable, notice will be delivered to Owner at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the date on which such person
will cease to serve in such role.
9.2.2        Mutual
Agreement . In addition to providing notice to Owner pursuant to Section 9.2.1, Contractor will cause Key Personnel not to be removed or re-assigned from their positions and to continue to perform the Work until the Parties reach mutual
agreement regarding a transition plan, unless (i) otherwise requested by Owner or (ii) the continued performance of any such person in such role is impossible due to illness, disability, death or termination of employment. The Parties will
promptly begin to negotiate in good faith the terms of the transition plan for the departing personnel immediately following Contractor’s delivery of notice pursuant to Section 9.2.1. Each transition plan will be



50









developed by the Parties on a case-by-case basis for any departing personnel and will be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties. All transition plans will include at least the
following: (i) technical requirements (if not already defined), (ii) a timetable for integration of the replacement personnel into the Key Personnel position, and (iii) replacement methodology designed to minimize the loss of
knowledge as a result of losing the previous Key Personnel.
9.3        Independent
Contractor: Employees . Neither Contractor nor Contractor’s employees are or shall be deemed to be employees of Owner. Contractor shall be solely responsible for the payment of compensation (including provision for employment taxes,
federal, state and local income taxes, workers compensation and any similar taxes) associated with the employment of Contractor’s employees. Contractor shall also be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining all requisite work
permits, visas, and any other documentation required under Applicable Law and Applicable Permits for its employees and shall require that all Subcontractors do the same for their employees . Contractor represents that Contractor, its employees,
and those Subcontractors authorized by Owner under this Agreement, are authorized to perform services under this Agreement.
9.4        Applicable Time Period. The provisions set forth in this Article 9 shall be applicable and binding upon Contractor from the date of issuance of the LNTP through and up to the date of
Final Completion.
10. TARGET COST
10.1      Facility Target Cost . The Target Cost of the Work associated with each Facility is as follows:
Morgantown          –            $402,621,000.00
Dickerson                 –            $269,329,000.00
Chalk
Point                –            $285,224,000.00
as such Target Cost may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to a Change Order.
10.2      Calculation of Contractor’s Actual Cost .
10.2.1        Categories of Costs . The Actual Cost for Work performed on a
System is the sum of the costs for Actual Home Office Labor Costs, Actual Field Non-Manual Labor Costs, Actual Self-Performed Field Manual Services Costs, and Actual Third Party Expenses as described in Sections 10.2.2 through 10.2.5 incurred before
the date of the first occurrence of an Initial Performance Test that does not satisfy the applicable Performance Guarantees, plus any such actual costs incurred to perform the Initial Performance Test and to complete the Punch List, but excluding
any liquidated damages under Section 8.2.


51








10.2.2        Actual Home Office
Labor Costs . The actual costs for home office labor including labor employed at the Contractor’s home office and at any other location away from a Site ( “Actual Home Office Labor Costs” ) shall be calculated by
multiplying the number of hours spent on tasks necessary for proper performance of the Work by such persons times the labor rates set forth in Exhibit 8D. Such rates are fully burdened including mark-up for SG&A and will not be
modified except by Change Order in accordance with Section 19.11 for escalation on January 1 of each year, of five percent (5%) per annum as provided in Exhibit 8D. The reasonable actual cost of travel of persons classified
as home office labor shall be allowed only as provided in accordance with Contractor’s travel and expense reimbursement policy in effect on the Effective Date, subject only to non-material annual adjustments such as adjustment of the rate of
reimbursement for mileage to match changes in the mileage allowance contained in the Internal Revenue Code.
10.2.3        Actual Field Non-Manual Labor Costs . The actual costs for field non-manual labor including Contractor’s supervisory or management personnel located on a Site (
“Actual Field Non-Manual Labor Costs” ) shall be calculated by multiplying the number of hours spent on tasks necessary for proper performance of the Work by such persons times the labor rates set forth in Exhibit 8D. Such
rates are fully burdened including mark-up for SG&A and will not be modified except by Change Order in accordance with Section 19.11 for escalation on January 1 of each year, of five percent (5%) per annum as provided in
Exhibit 8D. The reasonable actual cost of travel of persons classified as field non-manual labor shall be allowed only as provided in accordance with Contractor’s travel and expense reimbursement policy in effect on the Effective
Date, subject only to non-material annual adjustments such as adjustment of the rate of reimbursement for mileage to match changes in the mileage allowance contained in the Internal Revenue Code.
10.2.4        Actual Self-Performed Field Manual Services Costs . The actual
costs for employees the Contractor has hired to perform construction related tasks at a Site ( “Actual Self-Performed Field Manual Services Costs” ) shall be calculated by multiplying the number of hours spent on tasks necessary for
proper performance of the Work by such persons times the hourly costs for such persons as set forth in certified payrolls and any other evidence as provided by Contractor. The hourly rates stated in Exhibit 8B shall be subject to increase or
decrease semi-annually by Change Order pursuant to the process provided in Section 19.10 below. The rates shall be burdened only with the following categories of additional labor-related costs applicable thereto, which shall be adjusted by
Change Order pursuant to Section 19.2 in the event of a change in the benefits, safety incentive or per diem paid by Contractor to its employees working on the Project or a change in premiums paid for WC/GL insurance, or by Change Order
pursuant to Section 19.9 for a Change in Applicable Law:
Benefits
=            5% (initial)
Federal Unemployment Insurance = 0.8%
(initial)
State Unemployment Insurance =    2.3% (initial)
FICA/HI =          7.65% (initial)
WC/GL =            5% (initial)
Safety Incentive =            $0.5/hour (initial)
Per Diem =          $7/hour (initial)
SG&A =              8.5%


52








The percentage mark-ups for Benefits, FUI, SUI, FICA/HI, and WC/GL shall be applied only to
the base published craft labor rate, and shall not be applied to the Safety Incentives or Per Diem. The SG&A shall be applied to the fully-burdened rates including the base craft labor rate, Benefits, FUI, SUI, FICA/HI, WC/GL, Safety Incentive
and Per Diem. The percentage mark-ups for FUI, SUI, FICA/HI and WC/GL shall be charged only on the portion of wages and other compensation that is actually subject to tax, withholding or deduction under FUI, SUI, FICA/HI and WC/GL, and shall
not apply to any amount of wages or other compensation that exceeds the applicable caps or limitations on wages or other compensation, as provided by relevant statute, regulation or contract.
10.2.5        Actual Third Party Expenses: Unless expressly
waived by Owner in writing, all Subcontractors will be selected by Contractor based on a competitive sourcing process demonstrating best value, including subcontractors that are on the approved subcontractor lists included in Exhibit 1, as further
supplemented by agreement of the Parties (the “Approved Subcontractor List” ). “ Actual Third Party Expenses ” shall include only payments made by Contractor to Subcontractors or other third parties that are
necessary for proper performance of the Work and substantiated by paid invoices. Actual Third Party Expenses shall be marked-up by 8.5% to cover SG&A expenses. Actual Third Party Expenses shall be calculated net of discounts, rebates,
insurance proceeds, or other payments or credits of any kind received by Contractor from a Subcontractor or other third party. Subject to the conditions and requirements of this Section 10.2.5, Actual Third Party Expenses may include, among
other costs, costs incurred for Commodities, for equipment packages, for furnish & erect subcontracts and for subcontracted labor.
10.2.6        Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . All SG&A costs are included in the rates used for calculating Actual Home Office
Labor Costs and Actual Field Non-Manual Labor Costs as set forth in Exhibit 8D, the calculation of Actual Self-Performed Field Manual Services Costs set forth in Section 10.2.4, and the calculation of Actual Third Party Expenses set forth
in Section 10.2.5.

Contractor shall keep separate accounts for Actual Costs, Performance Incentives and Guarantee Costs incurred at each Facility for Work performed under the Target Price method (Section 13.2), and shall make such accounts available for Owner’s
inspection on an Open Book basis.
10.3        Cap on Contractor’s Total
Engineering Hours . Subject to modification by Change Order pursuant to Article 19, Contractor’s total engineering hours to complete the Work, including hours before and after issuance of NTP, shall not exceed the following:
Morgantown =        275,000 hours
Chalk Point =            253,000 hours
Dickerson =              242,000 hours
Any hours in excess of the capped amount shall be the Contractor’s sole expense and shall not be included in the Actual Costs.

11.4      Incentives
11.4.1      Blank
11.4.2      Performance Incentives . The following incentives (the “Performance
Incentives” ) can be earned by Contractor based on its performance:
11.4.2.1    Early Completion of Work During Planned Outages . If an outage is planned exclusively for Contractor, and the Contractor completes its Work during the outage early so that the outage
duration is reduced and Owner is able to benefit from this early completion, Owner shall pay Contractor the following incentive:
Morgantown =                $35,000 per Unit per day
Chalk Point
=                   $25,000 per Unit per day
Dickerson =                     $15,000 per Unit per day
11.4.2.1.1      For the purpose of calculation of the above incentive, the outage start shall
be 07:00 on the start date and the outage end shall be 23:59 on the end date. Each day of early completion shall be calculated from the end date and time. The following examples illustrate the implementation of this incentive and are for
intended solely for clarification purposes:
1.      If an outage at Morgantown was to be
completed on August 31, 2009, and the outage is complete on August 30, 2009, at 23:00 hours, Owner shall owe Contractor an incentive of $35,000.
2.      If an outage at Morgantown was to be completed on August 31, 2009, and the outage is complete on August 30, 2009, at 08:00 hours, Owner shall owe Contractor
an incentive of $35,000.
3.      If the outage at Morgantown was to be completed on
August 31, 2009, and the outage is complete on August 31, 2009, at 02:00 hours, Owner shall owe Contractor an incentive of $0.00.

basis. This incentive includes incentives based on Contractor’s safety record each calendar quarter, and also its safety record for each Facility. The incentive for Contractor’s safety record during a calendar quarter shall be paid if
Contractor has met the criteria set forth in the table below. This incentive shall be assessed for safety and spills specified for once each Calendar Quarter in the Approved Final Milestone Payment Schedule. Such incentive shall be payable as
part of the first payment after the end of the Calendar Quarter. If there is any incentive that is assessed prior to NTP due to the Contractor, such incentive amount shall be paid with the first safety incentive payment after NTP.



56








If Contractor does not meet the standard in some of the specified quarters,
however meets the standard for the Facility as a whole, the unpaid safety incentive shall be considered earned at Substantial Completion of the last System of the Facility.

12.2        Milestone Progress Payments
12.2.1        A schedule (the “ Approved Final Milestone Payment
Schedule ”) showing the dollar amount associated with each Milestone (the “Incremental Payment Amounts”), and the Calendar Quarter in which the Milestone is scheduled to be completed, is included in Exhibit 9. Exhibit 9 also
includes a curve (the “ Cash Curve ”) based on an original schedule of the cumulative value of Incremental Payment Amounts for Milestones scheduled for completion in each Calendar Quarter. So long as the cumulative total to date of
actual Milestone Progress Payments does not exceed the Cash Curve (as is adjusted from time to time by the same Change Order adjustments to the Target Cost and Fee), Contractor is entitled to payment for any completed Milestones irrespective of the
number of Milestones or sequence. Notwithstanding, if the Parties mutually agree that, in certain circumstances, it is in the best interest of the Project to allow for increased expenditures, then Owner shall allow for exceeding the Cash Curve
or shall otherwise adjust the Cash Curve to a higher level to allow the desired expenditures.
12.2.2        The Approved Final Milestone Payment Schedule shall be used as the basis for preparation of requests for payment, and payment, of progress payments ( “Milestone Progress
Payments” ) to Contractor. Milestone Progress Payments shall be made in accordance with the Milestones achieved under the


59








Approved Final Milestone Payment Schedule. Upon achievement of a Milestone, Contractor
shall submit to Owner for its approval a request for payment for (i) the corresponding Incremental Payment Amount, (ii) the Target Fee associated with this payment that equals Five Percent (5%) of this payment and (iii) any
Applicable Safety , Schedule and Quality Incentives as set forth in Article 11.4.2.2 . Each request for payment shall identify in detail the amounts to which Contractor considers it is entitled under this Agreement for the applicable Milestone.
As a minimum, each request for payment shall identify the following:
12.2.2.1        the Milestone to which the request for payment relates and the corresponding Incremental Payment Amount for that Milestone;
12.2.2.2        any amount which Owner is entitled to deduct set off or withhold
from Contractor;
12.2.2.3        each request for payment shall
contain the tax identification number of both Owner and Contractor and all such other information as may be required from time to time under applicable tax laws; and
12.2.2.4        the total amount which Contractor claims under that request for
payment.
12.2.3     Contractor can request a partial payment for a Scheduled
Milestone where the Work included in that Milestone may not be fully completed, provided Contractor shall submit with its request for payment sufficient documentation satisfactory to Owner to substantiate the cost of the associated Work completed.
Each request for partial payment shall identify in detail the amounts to which Contractor considers it is entitled under this Agreement as of the date the applicable Milestone is partially completed. Contractor shall submit to Owner for its approval
a request for payment for (i) the corresponding partial payment amount, (ii) the Target Fee associated with this payment that equals Five Percent (5%) of this payment and (iii) any Applicable Safety , Schedule and Quality
Incentives as set forth in Article 11.4.2.2. As a minimum, each request for payment shall identify the following:

12.2.3.2        any amount which Owner is entitled to deduct set off or withhold
from Contractor;
12.2.3.3        each request for payment shall
contain the tax identification number of both Owner and Contractor and all such other information as may be required from time to time under applicable tax laws; and


60








12.2.3.4 the total amount which Contractor claims under that request
for payment.
12.2.3.5 the calculations that support the percentage of milestone payment that is being
requested.
12.2.4     Any request for payment which is not accompanied by all of the
information identified in Section 12.2.2 and 12.2.3 shall not constitute a valid and proper request for payment.
12.2.5     In addition, each request for payment shall include documentary evidence of achieving the corresponding Milestone. Owner shall not be obligated to make payment of amounts in the current month that
would cause the cumulative total to date of Milestone Progress Payments to exceed the Cash Curve for the current month, but Owner shall pay such amounts promptly with the next request for payment from Contractor.
12.2.6     Owne r shall review each such request for payment and may make such exceptions in
accordance with this Agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of same. Payment of amounts due and payable shall be made by Owner within fifteen (15) calendar days after the foregoing fifteen -day review period has
expired. Unless Owner within the fifteen-day review period confirms that a request for payment does not include all information and documentation required by this Section 12.2, or that the Work included in the relevant Milestone has not been
completed properly, then Owner shall make payment to Contractor as provided in this Article 12. If Owner discovers an error in Contractor’s request for payment, Owner shall immediately notify Contractor thereof and upon receipt of a correct
request for payment by Contractor shall immediately pay such invoice in accordance with the Agreement.
12.2.7     The payment of any Milestone Progress Payment by Owner shall not constitute approval or acceptance by Owner of the Work, any part thereof or of any item of cost in the corresponding request for payment.

12.3     Quarterly Reconciliation.
12.3.1  Each January, April, July, and October, Owner and Contractor shall work together in good faith to
complete, for the immediately preceding Calendar Quarter, the reconciliation activities described in Sections 12.3.2 through 12.3.12.
12.3.2  A “ Scheduled Milestone ” is a Milestone which, according to the Approved Final Milestone Schedule as modified in accordance with Section 12.1.1.1.4, was scheduled
to be completed during the Calendar Quarter being


61








reconciled or which was re-sequenced by Contractor from prior or subsequent Calendar
Quarters to occur in the current Calendar Quarter.
12.3.3        An
“ Incomplete Milestone ” is a Scheduled Milestone that was not completed during the Calendar Quarter being reconciled.
12.3.4        The “ Quarterly Reconciliation Ratio ” is expressed as a percentage, and is the quotient of (i) the sum of the Incremental
Payment Amounts for Scheduled Milestones that were actually completed during the Calendar Quarter, divided by (ii) the total of the Incremental Payment Amounts for all of the Scheduled Milestones for that Calendar Quarter.
12.3.5        The “ Quarterly Actual Cost ” is the sum of the costs
incurred by Contractor for its own personnel or paid by Contractor to third parties during the immediately preceding Calendar Quarter that are verified and documented by Contractor’s records for its own personnel or invoices paid by Contractor
to third parties as evidenced by electronic payment receipts or other reliable means of verification and documentation, that are Actual Costs in accordance with Section 10.2. Any costs or expenses about which Contractor and Owner disagree
as being Actual Costs shall not be included in the Quarterly Actual Cost for the purpose of the reconciliation and shall be deemed to be “ Disputed Costs ”. Any Disputed Costs shall be grounds for a Claim by either Party under
Article 33. The quarterly reconciliation process shall be conducted solely for the purposes of determining the amount of interim progress payments, and not for the purpose of determining Project Compensation and EPC Total Compensation. Any agreement
by Owner and Contractor concerning Quarterly Actual Cost, and any determination or agreement of the Parties regarding Disputed Cost, shall not be relevant or binding for the purpose of determining the Project Compensation and EPC Total Compensation.

12.3.6        The “ Reconcilable Cost ” is the sum
of (i) the Quarterly Actual Cost for a Calendar Quarter multiplied by the Quarterly Reconciliation Ratio for that Calendar Quarter, plus (ii) any Carryover Cost allocated to a delayed Milestone that is completed during that Calendar
Quarter.
12.3.7        The “ Quarterly Milestone Payment
Cost ” is the sum of the Milestone Progress Payments made by Owner to Contractor during a Calendar Quarter, less any portion of the Target Fee and Safety, Quality and Schedule Incentive included in those payments.
12.3.8        The “ Quarterly Benchmark Cost ” is the sum of
(i) the Quarterly Milestone Payment Cost, (ii) the Quarterly Contingency Allowance, and (iii) any Approved Contingency Draw Requests approved by Owner for that Calendar Quarter.


62








12.3.9     To perform the reconciliation, the
Reconcilable Cost for the Calendar Quarter shall be compared to the Quarterly Milestone Payment Cost paid by Owner to Contractor for the immediately preceding Calendar Quarter and the Quarterly Benchmark Cost for that Calendar Quarter, as follows:

12.3.9.1        Should the Reconcilable Cost be less than the
Quarterly Milestone Payment Cost then the difference shall be deemed an “ Excess Payment .” Any Excess Payment shall be deducted from any amount otherwise due and payable by Owner to Contractor under the next payment request
submitted by Contractor to Owner. Such amounts shall not be treated as Contingency and shall be available to Contractor in subsequent Calendar Quarters by the use of an internal change order without the need for a Contingency Draw
Request. If no further payment requests are to be submitted by Contractor to Owner, then the Excess Payment shall be credited to Owner if due following final reconciliation as set forth in Section 12.11.2 and the calculation of the EPC
Total Compensation and Target Final Payment pursuant to Section 12.11.2 and Article 13.
12.3.9.2        Should the Reconcilable Cost be greater than the Quarterly Milestone Payment Cost and less than the Quarterly Benchmark Cost, then the difference between the Quarterly Milestone
Payment Cost and the Reconcilable Cost shall be deemed a “ Payable Cost ”. Contractor shall add the Payable Cost to its next payment request to Owner. If no further payment requests are to be submitted by Contractor to Owner,
then Contractor shall submit a separate payment request for the Payable Cost and Owner shall make payment on such application in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement relating to requests for payment.
12.3.10   Should the Reconcilable Cost be greater than the Quarterly Benchmark Cost then:
12.3.10.1        Contractor shall submit a supplemental Contingency Draw Request to
support the difference between the Reconcilable Cost and the Quarterly Benchmark Cost, which shall be subject to approval by Owner in accordance with Section 12.6.4; and.
12.3.10.2        the difference between the Quarterly Milestone Payment Cost and
the Quarterly Benchmark Cost shall be a Payable Cost and shall be included in a subsequent payment request, and paid by Owner, as provided Section 12.3.9.2; and


63








12.3.11        A “ Carryover
Cost ” is a cost that is excluded from reconciliation on account of one or more Incomplete Milestones. If there are no Incomplete Milestones during a Calendar Quarter, then the Reconciliation Ratio shall be one (1.0) and there
shall be no Carryover Cost from that Calendar Quarter. If there are one or more Incomplete Milestones during a Calendar Quarter, then the Reconciliation Ratio is less than one (1.0) and the Carryover Cost from that Calendar Quarter
shall be (i) the Quarterly Actual Cost multiplied by (ii) the difference between one (1.0) and the Quarterly Reconciliation Ratio. If there is one Incomplete Milestone during the Calendar Quarter, the Carryover Cost shall be
assigned to that Incomplete Milestone. If there is more than one Incomplete Milestone during the Calendar Quarter, then the Carryover Cost shall allocated and assigned to the Incomplete Milestones in amounts proportional to the Incremental
Payment Amounts associated with each such Incomplete Milestone. The Carryover Cost assigned to any Incomplete Milestone shall be added to the Payable Cost for the Calendar Quarter in which that Incomplete Milestone is completed.
12.3.12        The NTP Milestone payment referred to in
Section 12.1.3 shall be excluded from the reconciliation described in Sections 12.3.2 through 12.3.11 for the Calendar Quarters beginning with the month the NTP is issued and ending with the month that is twelve (12) months after
NTP. Beginning with the thirteenth (13 th ) month after
NTP, the NTP Milestone payment referred to in Section 12.1.3 shall be added back to the Quarterly Actual Cost at the rate of twelve million dollars ($12 million) for each Calendar Quarter until the total of such NTP Milestone Payment
amount is accounted for in the reconciliation process.
12.4 Blank
12.5 Payments not made in accordance with Sections 12.2.6, 12.3.12., 12.8, 12.11.2, 12.13 shall be subject to late payment interest at the prime rate reported in the Wall Street Journal on the date
such payment is due and payable, plus 1%.
12.6 Contingency
12.6.1    The “ Quarterly Contingency Allowance Limit ” for each Calendar Quarter is
One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00). Contractor shall be allowed access and use of the Quarterly Contingency Allowance Limit without prior approval of the Owner. Any unused portion of the Quarterly Contingency
Allowance Limit shall not be subject to carryover.
12.6.2    Contractor shall attempt to
identify, as early as practicable, any events, causes, conditions, trends or occurrences that are likely to cause the Actual Costs during a Calendar Quarter to be greater than Contractor’s original estimate of the cost of the Work to be
performed during that Calendar Quarter by an amount greater than the Quarterly Contingency Allowance. Without limiting Contractor’s rights and other obligations under the Agreement, including its rights


64









and obligations under Article 19, Contractor shall give notice to Owner, in the form of a written “ Contingency Draw Request ”, of all such events, causes, conditions or
occurrences of which Contractor becomes aware .  The Contingency Draw Request shall identify and describe (i) the anticipated or actual magnitude of the cost overrun, (ii) the events, circumstances, conditions or occurrences
giving rise to the cost overrun, and (iii) the individual incurred or anticipated cost items involved.
12.6.3    When complete information is not readily available, Contractor shall issue a “ Contingency Draw Notification ” including such information as is reasonably available at the time. Contractor
may convert a Contingency Draw Notification to a Contingency Draw Request by providing the information specified in Section 12.6.2. While such notification cannot form part of the quarterly reconciliation process, the notification will
provide a basis for more expeditious consideration by Owner of a cost, when it is converted to a Contingency Draw Request.
12.6.4    Upon receipt by Owner of a Contingency Draw Request, Owner and Contractor will discuss any measures that Contractor has taken, and any additional steps that Contractor or
Owner might take, to minimize or eliminate the potential cost overrun and any time limits or other practical limitations relating to such additional steps. Owner and Contractor shall make a good-faith effort to work collaboratively to determine
what work-around steps or alternate measures may be appropriate. Owner may by written notice to Contractor, based on these discussions and collaborative efforts, approve a Contingency Draw Request in whole or in part. Any dispute with respect
to Owner’s approval of Contingency Draw Request shall be subject to provisions of Article 33.5.

possession and control of such System to Owner and prior to Final Completion of such System, Contractor will have reasonable access to such System and the Site so as to complete the Punch-List items on such System.
18. FINAL COMPLETION .
18.1      Requirements . “ Final Completion ” of the Work required in connection with each Facility will be achieved, with respect to such Facility or System, when:
18.1.1      Contractor has achieved Substantial Completion of the Work required in connection
with all Systems at the Facility;
18.1.2      Owner and Contractor have
completed Final Reconciliation.
18.1.3      Contractor has completed all
Punch-List items for all Systems at the Facility, or has bought-down all such Punch-List items of a price mutually agreed upon by Owner and Contractor;
18.1.4      Contractor has executed and delivered to Owner all full lien waivers and releases for the Facility or System as required under Section 12.10.2.3 (or, in lieu
thereof, Contractor has provided and Owner has accepted a lien discharge bond or other security as allowed under Section 12.10.2.5); and
18.1.5      Contractor has delivered to Owner (i) As-Built Drawings as required under Section 6.5.5; (ii) copies of all purchase orders, contracts,
subcontracts and material requisitions with its Subcontractors who performed Work on or in connection with such System, as required under Section 32.8; (iii) legally effective written assignments of all Subcontractor guarantees and



78









warranties on Systems Equipment that were provided by such Subcontractors in connection with such System, as required in Section 32.5; (vi) a list of the names, addresses, and telephone
numbers of all Subcontractors providing such guarantees and warranties; and (v) the turnover package required under Section 6.5.7.
18.2      Notice and Report of Final Completion . At such time as Contractor believes that it has met the requirements under Sections 18.1.1 through 18.1.5 for a
Facility, it will deliver to Owner a written notice thereof (the “ Notice of Final Completion ”). The Notice of Final Completion for each System will contain a report in a form acceptable to Owner and with sufficient detail to
enable Owner to determine whether Contractor has achieved such requirements.
18.3      Achievement of Final Completion . Owner will within five (5) Business Days following Owner’s receipt of the Notice of Final Completion for a Facility, either (i) deliver a
written certification stating that the requirements for Final Completion of such Facility have been achieved, or (ii) notify Contractor in writing that such requirements have not been achieved, stating the reasons therefore. If Owner certifies
that such requirements have been met, then the date of such Notice of Final Completion will be deemed the date Final Completion of such Facility or System. If Owner notifies Contractor that such requirements have not been met, then Contractor will
promptly take such actions as will cause such requirements to be met, and upon meeting such requirements, Contractor will issue to Owner another Notice of Final Completion. Such procedure will be repeated as necessary until Owner certifies that such
requirements have been met. Should Owner fail to make any notification to Contractor within the aforesaid five (5) Business Day period after its receipt of Notice of Final Completion, then the Facility shall be deemed to have achieved Final
Completion as of the date of the Notice of Final Completion. So long as Owner has satisfied the aforesaid five-Business Day notice requirement, the issuance by Owner of a certificate stating that the requirements of Sections 18.1.1 through
18.1.5 have been met shall be a condition to achievement of Final Completion.
19. CHANGE ORDERS
19.1      Changes . Without invalidating this Agreement, Owner may issue an order making Changes
(each such order, a “Change Order” ) to the Work, in which event one or more of the Contract Price or the Approved Project Schedule may be adjusted as provided in this Article 19. Changes may only be authorized by Change Orders
issued in accordance with this Article 19. Change Orders will constitute the exclusive remedy to Contractor for any Changes.
19.2      Procedure for Changes .
19.2.1      Changes Initiated by Contractor . Should Contractor become aware of any circumstances which Contractor has reason to believe may necessitate a Change, Contractor will issue to Owner a
written “Change Order Notice . ” All Change Order Notices will include, to the extent practicable, documentation



79









sufficient to enable Owner to determine (i) the factors necessitating the possibility of a Change, (ii) the impact which the Change is likely to have on the Contract Price based on the
time and materials rate charges in effect at the time of the Change pursuant to Section 10.2 of this Agreement, (iii) the impact which the Change is likely to have on Contractor’s compliance with the Approved Project Schedule, and
(iv) such other information which Owner may request in connection with such Change. If Contractor fails to provide a Change Order Notice to Owner within fifteen (15) Business Days after Contractor knew about the first occurrence or
circumstance resulting in the possibility of such Change, then notwithstanding anything in this Article 19 to the contrary, Contractor agrees that Owner’s ability to exercise its rights pursuant to Section 19.16 shall have been compromised
and Contractor will be deemed to have waived any right to receive a Change Order based upon such occurrence or circumstance. Owner may, but except as provided in Sections 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6, 19.7, 19.9, 19.10, 19.11 and 19.12 below,
will not be obligated to, issue a Change Order pursuant to a Change Order Notice. Unless otherwise stated by Owner in writing or in the event of an emergency that poses an immediate threat to life or property, any work outside the Work
described in the Contract Documents performed by Contractor prior to its having received a Change Order from Owner will be at Contractor’s sole risk.
19.2.2      Changes Initiated by Owner . If Owner desires to make a Change, it will submit a “Change Order Request” to
Contractor. Contractor will promptly review the Change Order Request and notify Owner in writing, as promptly as possible and no later than five (5) Business Days after receipt, of the options for implementing the proposed Change
(including, if possible, any option that does not involve an increase in the Contract Price or an extension of the Approved Project Schedule) and to the extent practicable based on reasonably available information the effect, if any, each such
option would have on the Contract Price and the Approved Project Schedule. After consideration of such information, Owner may, but will not be obligated to, issue a Change Order pursuant to this Section 19.2.2.
19.2.3      Change in Cost Element and Fee Element . Any change to the Contract
Price shall be in the amount of the sum of the associated changes in the Cost Element and the Fee Element pursuant to Section 19.14:

19.2.3.2        The “Fee Element” means the Target Fee.

19.3      Change Order Due to Force Majeure Event . In the event and to the extent
that a Force Majeure event Directly Causes a delay to the critical path of the Work at the time of the Force Majeure event, then upon submission of a proper Change Order Notice and subject to the other Sections of this Article 19, the Approved
Project Schedule will be extended by Change Order by the number of calendar days of actual delay to the critical



80









path of the Work at the time of the Force Majeure event. Such Change Order will be Contractor’s sole and exclusive remedy for any such delay. To the extent an event of Force
Majeure affects Contractor’s costs, the provisions of Section 20.4 will apply.
19.4      Change Order Due to Suspension of Work by Owner . In the event that Owner suspends the Work pursuant to the provisions of Section 23.2, then, upon submission of a proper Change Order
Notice and subject to the other Sections of this Article 19, Contractor will be entitled to a Change Order extending the Approved Project Schedule as required and, if necessary, increasing the Contract Price pursuant to Section 19.14 so as to
equitably compensate Contractor for additional demonstrable Direct Costs incurred by Contractor as Directly Caused by such suspension. Such Change Order will be Contractor’s sole and exclusive remedy for such increased costs and/or
delay. During the suspension period, Owner shall reimburse Contractor on a time and material basis for its stand-by charges, storage and maintenance charges, and demobilization and remobilization charges.
19.5      Change Order Due to Differing Site Conditions . In the event Contractor encounters a
subsurface condition at the Site that is not reasonably ascertainable from the information provided in the Geotechnical Study prepared pursuant to Section 31.1 (including but not limited to information relating to the water table, rock
formations, and the bearing capacity of soil) and to the extent such condition Directly Causes an increase to Contractor’s Direct Cost of performing the Work and/or Directly Causes a delay to the critical path of the Work at the time such
condition is encountered, then, upon submission of a proper Change Order Notice and subject to the other Sections of this Article 19, the Approved Project Schedule will be extended by Change Order by the number of calendar days of actual delay to
the critical path of the Work at the time the subsurface condition is encountered, and the Contract Price shall be increased pursuant to Section 19.14 so as to equitably compensate Contractor for additional demonstrable Direct Costs incurred by
Contractor and Directly Caused by such condition.
19.6      Change Order Due to Pre-Existing
Hazardous Substances . In the event Contractor encounters Hazardous Substances that were present at the Site prior to the date of the NTP, or that were brought to or deposited on the Site by Owner or a separate contractor of Owner, and to
the extent such condition Directly Causes an increase to Contractor’s Direct Cost of performing the Work and/or Directly Causes a delay to the critical path of the Work at the time such condition is encountered, then, upon submission of a
proper Change Order Notice and subject to the other Sections of this Article 19, the Approved Project Schedule will be extended by Change Order by the number of calendar days of actual delay to the critical path of the Work at the time the
subsurface condition is encountered, and the Contract Price shall be increased pursuant to Section 19.14 so as to equitably compensate Contractor for additional demonstrable Direct Costs incurred by Contractor and Directly Caused by such
condition.
19.7      Change Order Due to Actions of Owner . In the event Contractor
suffers increased costs and/or a delay in the critical path progress of the Work and to the extent such increased costs and/or delay is Directly Caused by the acts or omissions of Owner,

subject to the other Sections of this Article 19, Contractor shall be entitled to a Change Order extending the Approved Project Schedule as required and, if necessary, increasing the Contract Price pursuant to Section 19.14 so as to equitably
compensate Contractor for additional demonstrable Direct Costs or critical path delay incurred or experienced by Contractor as Directly Caused by such acts or omissions of Owner. Such Change Order shall be Contractor’s sole and exclusive
remedy for such increased costs and/or delay.
19.8      Blank .
19.9      Change Order Due to Changes in Applicable Law . The Parties acknowledge that Contractor
must adhere to all Applicable Laws. In the event Contractor incurs increased Direct Costs and/or a delay in the critical path progress of the Work that are Directly Caused by a Change in Applicable Law, then, upon submission of a proper Change
Order Notice and subject to the other Sections of this Article 19, Contractor shall be entitled to a Change Order extending the Approved Project Schedule by the number of calendar days of actual delay to the critical path of the Work at the time of
such Change in Applicable Law, and increasing the Contract Price pursuant to Section 19.14 so as to equitably compensate Contractor for additional demonstrable Direct Costs or critical path delay incurred by Contractor and Directly Caused by
such Change in Applicable Law. For purposes hereof, a “Change in Applicable Law” means the adoption, imposition, promulgation, cancellation, modification or change in the interpretation or application of, after the execution of
this Agreement of any state, city, county or other Applicable Law, which affects Contractor’s cost or performance of the Work; provided, however, that a change in law or regulation relating to (i) gross receipts, income, or other similar
taxes, or (ii) immigration or naturalization, shall not constitute a Change in Applicable Law for the purposes of this Section 19.9.
19.10    Change Order Due to Escalation in Actual Self-Performed Field Manual Services Costs. Contractor’s initial hourly costs for Actual Self-Performed Field Manual
Services are set forth in Exhibit 8B. On or before January 1 and July 1 of each year, Contractor shall submit to Owner a report (the “Escalation Report”) showing the amount of increase or decrease in such hourly cost that
Contractor request for the upcoming six-month period, based on changes in labor surveys and published reports of the cost for such labor. Each Escalation Report shall contain (i) the man-hours of labor for the remaining Work as set forth in
Exhibit 8B, and (ii) such information as Owner shall reasonably require to demonstrate the amount of labor cost escalation or de-escalation reported in the indices or published reports for such hourly labor. Owner shall review and verify
each Escalation Report within fifteen (15) days of receipt. To the extent that such escalation or de-escalation is justified by the Contractor’s Escalation Report, the Contract Price shall be adjusted by Change Order in the
amount of the increase in hourly costs multiplied by the remaining Work hours as set forth in Exhibit 8B, without any mark-up for Target Fee. The exclusive method for modifying the Contract Price based on increases or decreases in Contractor’s
hourly labor costs under Section 10.2.4 shall be a



82









Change Order pursuant to this Section 19.10 and such Change Order shall be Contractor’s sole and exclusive remedy for escalation of Actual Self-Performed Field Manual Services Costs.

19.11  Change Order Due to Escalation in Home Office Labor Costs and Actual Field Non-Manual Labor Costs
.. Contractor’s initial hourly rates for Home Office Labor and Field Non-Manual Labor are set forth in Exhibit 8D. On or before January 15 of each year, Contractor shall submit to Owner a Change Order Notice for a five percent
(5%) increase in such rates. Upon submission of a proper Change Order Notice and subject to the other Sections of this Article 19, Contractor shall be entitled to a Change Order increasing the Target Cost by the product of the increase in
rates multiplied by the man-hours for the remaining Work hours as set forth in Exhibit 8B, and the amount of the increase in the Target Fee shall be calculated in accordance with Section 19.14.4. The exclusive method for modifying the
Contract Price based on increases or decreases in Contractor’s hourly cost under Section 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 shall be a Change Order pursuant to this Section 19.11.
19.12        Change Order Due to Escalation of Commodities
.. Within fifteen (15) days after the date that a firm and enforceable price is established for the Commodity, Contractor shall submit a Change Order Notice. The Change Order shall be based on the change in the value of the index as set

of submission of a Change Order Notice under Section 19.2.1, or within ten (10) Business Days after submission of a Change Order Request under Section 19.2.2, the Contractor shall prepare and submit, on an Open Book basis, an analysis
of the delay, if any, caused by such Change to the critical path progress of the Work. Contractor shall supplement this analysis on an Open Book basis with such other information as Owner may reasonably require. Any Change Order extending any
date in the Approved Project Schedule will only extend such date(s) by a number of calendar days, at a maximum, equal to the number of calendar days of delay Directly Caused to the actual critical path of the Work at the time of the event giving
rise to the Change Order and only to the extent that such delay to the critical path progress of the Work has been demonstrated by Contractor to Owner’s reasonable satisfaction.
19.14      Changes to the Contract Price. Within five (5) Business Days of
submission of a Change Order Notice under Section 19.2.1, or within ten (10) Business Days after submission of a Change Order Request under Section 19.2.2, the Contractor shall prepare and submit, on an Open Book basis, an analysis of
the impact of the Change on the Cost Element for the System, Facility, or Project, as the context may require.


83








Contractor shall supplement this analysis on an Open Book basis with such other information as Owner may
reasonably require. The amount of an increase or decrease in the Cost Element and Fee Element, if any, resulting from a Change will be determined and will be included in the Change Order as follows:
19.14.1        in a lump sum amount proposed by Contractor and accepted by Owner; or

19.14.2        if Owner does not accept the lump sum amount proposed
by Contractor, by unit prices agreed upon by the Parties; or
19.14.3        if neither of the methods set forth in Sections 19.14.1 or 19.14.2 is agreed upon after good faith negotiation by the Parties, Contractor will provide Owner with such purchase orders,
invoices, Subcontractor quotes and other documents and records as Owner may require to verify, to its satisfaction, Contractor’s incremental Direct Costs or savings of effecting such Change (or Directly Caused by the event necessitating such
Change) ( “Contractor’s Additional Direct Costs or Savings” ). All equipment, materials, labor, equipment rental and other items associated with such Change will be purchased by Contractor at competitive market
prices. Owner will, upon verifying Contractor’s Additional Direct Costs or Savings associated with such Change, adjust the Cost Element by an amount equal to such Contractor’s Additional Direct Costs or Savings, the calculation of
these shall be in accordance with the methodology used to develop the Target Cost. Owner will make appropriate adjustments to the amount of the applicable Incremental Payment Amount in the Approved Final Milestone Payment Schedule.
19.14.4        A Change Order that increases or decreases the Cost Element shall
also increase or decrease the Fee Element in an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage Fee times the amount of the increase or decrease in the Cost Element. The amount of increase or decrease in the Cost Element and the Fee Element
shall be stated separately on each Change Order. Adjustment in the Fee Element as provided in this Section 19.14.4 shall be Contractor’s sole remedy and sole means for adjusting its margins for profit, overhead, or similar costs due to
Changes in the Work, and Contractor expressly waives any claims for modification of such margins based on cardinal change or other legal or equitable theories.
19.15     Continued Performance Pending Resolution of Disputes . Notwithstanding and pending resolution of any dispute with respect to a Change, Contractor must
proceed, upon written notice from Owner, with the performance of any Change ordered by Owner. Contractor will be reimbursed provisionally on a time and material basis for any such Change ordered by Owner that increases the scope of the
Work. For disputed Changes that do not increase the scope of the Work, Contractor may request provisional reimbursement. Should Owner deny such provisional reimbursement, Contractor may submit a request for provisional reimbursement to the
DRB pursuant to Section 33.5.


84








19.16    Owner’s Right to Offset Changes . Whenever it
is determined that any Changes may require an extension of the Approved Project Schedule, Owner may, at its sole discretion and to the extent possible, elect to offset all or any part of such extension with other Changes (including but not limited
to Changes to the Contract Price) that will maintain the Approved Project Schedule. Whenever it is determined that any Changes may require an increase in the Contract Price, Owner may at its sole discretion and to the extent possible, elect to
offset all or any part of such increase with other Changes (including but not limited to Changes to the Approved Project Schedule) that will maintain the Contract Price.

20.3.5      No Force Majeure event shall excuse Owner’s payment obligations.

20.4      Costs . Any additional Direct Cost incurred by Contractor in performing Work, and
Directly Caused by Force Majeure shall not be grounds for an increase in the Target Cost by Change Order pursuant to Section 19.3 until the aggregate of such Direct Costs shall equal or exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000), and Contractor
shall only be entitled to a Change Order based on Force Majeure for the additional Direct Costs incurred by Contractor that exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000). Any costs incurred by Owner by reason of or Directly Caused by Force Majeure

22.2.3      Not later than ten (10) Business Days of issuance of the NTP for FGD Systems, Contractor shall amend the Letter of Credit or provide a new substitute
Letter of Credit equal to fifty million dollars ($50,000,000). The Letter of Credit in this Section 22.2 shall remain in effect and drawable by Owner until Substantial Completion of all Work for the last System on each Facility whereupon, the
amount of the Letter of Credit will be stepped down by an amount proportionate to the relative Target Cost of such Facility to the sum of the Target Costs for all three Facilities. The Letter of Credit shall be promptly returned to Contractor upon
the last System of the last Facility achieving Substantial Completion. To the extent that any replacement of a Letter of Credit is required to maintain compliance with this Section 22.2, Contractor shall deliver the replacement Letter of
Credit to Owner no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date when the existing Letter of Credit will expire. In the event of a failure to comply with the preceding sentence, Owner shall be entitled to draw upon the existing Letter of
Credit prior to the expiration thereof and take such further action to protect its interests pursuant to this Agreement.
22.3        Performance Bond and Payment Bond . To further assure Contractor’s performance under this Agreement, within ten (10) Business Days after the issuance of the NTP for
FGD Systems, Contractor will furnish to Owner a performance bond and a payment bond each having a face value of one hundred and fifty-five million dollars ($155,000,000). The combined penal sum of both bonds in the aggregate shall not exceed
the face value of either bond. Such performance and payment bonds shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit 12. The payment bond shall remain in effect and drawable until Final Completion. The performance bond will remain in
effect and drawable until Substantial Completion. The face value of the performance bond shall be stepped down as each Facility achieves Substantial Completion and the face value of the payment bond shall be stepped down as each facility
achieves Final Completion (the step-down being in an amount proportionate to the relative target Cost of the Facility to the sum of the Target Costs of all three Facilities). The payment bond shall be promptly returned to Contractor upon the last
Facility achieving Final Completion. At Substantial Completion of the last Facility, the performance bond provided at NTP shall be replaced with a performance bond covering all obligations of Contractor under Article 14 and Sections 7.2.2 for the
Equivalent Availability Guarantee referred to in Section 7.2.1.3 with a penal sum equal to ten percent (10%) of the Contract Price of the Project (the “Warranty Bond ”). In no event shall the combined penal sum of the
performance bond provided at NTP, and the Warranty Bond be less than ten percent (10%) of the Contract Price for the Project.
22.4        Owner Security . No later than ten (10) Business Days of issuance of the NTP for FGD Systems\, Owner shall provide a letter of credit in form and substance acceptable to
Contractor (as shown in Exhibit 11) from a mutually acceptable U.S. financial institution ( “Letter of Credit” ) for an amount of $55,000,000 (the “Owner Security” ). Contractor can request a change in
Owner’s Security to an amount not to exceed $80,000,000 in the event that Contractor’s committed cost exposure increases.


90








Contractor shall include in such request all documents as requested by Owner to justify the increase. If
Owner is satisfied, Owner will amend the Letter of Credit to the approved value. Such amendment shall be issued no later than Ten (10) business days from such approval. The letter of credit in this Section 22.4 shall remain in effect and
drawable by Contractor until release of fifty percent (50%) of the retention at Substantial Completion of each System, whereupon, the amount of the letter of credit will be stepped down by an amount proportionate to the relative Target Cost of
the Facility to the sum of the Target Costs of all three Facilities. The letter of credit shall be promptly returned to Owner upon Substantial Completion of the last System at the last Facility and release of the corresponding fifty percent of
retention for that System. To the extent that any replacement of a Letter of Credit is required to maintain compliance with this Section 22.4, Owner shall deliver the replacement Letter of Credit to Contractor no later than thirty
(30) days prior to the date when the existing Letter of Credit will expire. In the event of a failure to comply with the preceding sentence, Contractor shall be entitled to draw upon the existing Letter of Credit prior to the expiration
thereof and take such further action to protect its interests pursuant to this Agreement. Upon the issuance of the INTP, Owner shall provide to Contractor a parent company guarantee in a form acceptable to Contractor and issued by Mirant North
America, Inc., which shall guarantee the payment obligations of the Owner under this Agreement and the EPC Agreement up to the maximum amount of sixty-two million five hundred thousand dollars ($62,500,000).
23. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION

(ii) to meet its repair or replacement obligations under Section 28.1; (iii) to meet its safety obligations under Section 6.8; (iv) to meet its obligations to complete Punch-List items as provided in Section 17.5;
(v) to achieve Provisional Acceptance on or before the date that is thirty (30) days after the applicable Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date, or (vi) to perform the Work in accordance with the Approved Project Schedule such
that Owner can reasonably deduce that Contractor will not complete the Work necessary to comply with the requirements for an outage in accordance with Section 8.2.1.2, Owner shall be entitled to take any of the Owner-cure actions under such
Sections, then Owner may, by a written order signed by its Authorized Representative, order Contractor to stop performing all or a portion of the Work in order to allow Owner to take such actions. The foregoing right of Owner to stop
Contractor’s performance will not give rise to any duty on the part of Owner to exercise this right for the benefit of Contractor or any other person or entity. In addition, Owner, by written order signed by its Authorized Representative, may
order Contractor to stop performance if the activities of Contractor or Contractor’s Subcontractors reasonably appear to Owner to cause or threaten to cause damage to the property of Owner. In the event of such a stop order, Contractor will not
be entitled to a Change Order extending the Approved Project Schedule. The cost of any delays experienced by Contractor as a result of orders issued by Owner ordering Contractor to stop performance hereunder will be borne by Contractor. Owner’s
right to stop work under this Section 23.1 will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy Owner may have under this Agreement.


91








23.2        Right to Suspend Work for
Convenience . Owner may at any time and from time to time, by a written order signed by its Authorized Representative, suspend (and later reinstate) all or a portion of the Work without terminating this Agreement. Upon receipt of such
order, Contractor will immediately suspend its performance of the Work. In the event of a suspension of the Work, Contractor shall use its best efforts to mitigate potential delays to the date of Substantial Completion and to minimize the amount of
personnel and equipment that is idled and the costs associated with such suspension. If Owner suspends the Work pursuant to this Section, then Contractor will be entitled to a Change Order as described in Section 19.4.
23.3        Suspension by Contractor . Subject to Sections 19.15 and 33.6 for amounts
that are disputed in good faith, if Owner fails to pay to Contractor any payment when due under this Agreement and such failure continues for fifteen (15) calendar days after written notice thereof has been received by Owner from Contractor,

may, at any time and for any reason, terminate all or any part of this Agreement (provided that termination of part of the Agreement shall not be for substantially the entire scope for a Facility, unless Owner decides not to proceed with the Work
for the Facility) for Owner’s convenience and without cause by providing Contractor with written notice regarding the same. In the event of partial termination, the remaining Work under this Agreement shall be performed in accordance with all
of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Target Cost and Fees will be increased or decreased in proportion to the value of the Work terminated.
23.4.2      Termination Payment . Within
thirty (30) calendar days of Contractor’s having received notice from Owner under Section 23.4.1, Owner will reimburse Contractor for completed Work and work-in-progress, applicable vendor cancellation charges, demobilization costs,
and reasonable costs to bring the work to an orderly conclusion (collectively the “Termination Payment” ). The Termination Payment will be Contractor’s sole and exclusive remedy for such termination. Owner will not be
liable to Contractor, any Subcontractor or any other party for any damages or indirect, special, incidental costs or consequential liability resulting from such termination, including without limitation, prospective profits on Work not performed or
other consequential or incidental damages. The Parties recognize, agree and acknowledge that Owner’s termination right hereunder is a permitted action under this Agreement (and not a breach hereof or a default hereunder), which right
carries with it the obligation to make the Termination Payment. In the event of termination by Owner for convenience, Contractor’s liability limitations that are expressed as a percentage



92









of the Contract Price shall instead be calculated as a percentage of the actual compensation paid to Contractor.
23.4.3      Withholding/Conditions Precedent
.. Notwithstanding Section 23.4.2 Owner may withhold from such Termination Payment any unpaid amounts due from Contractor to Owner under this Agreement. Furthermore, the following will be conditions precedent to Owner’s obligation
to pay Contractor the Termination Payment: (i) Contractor’s executing and delivering all such documents and taking all such steps, including the assignment of Contractor’s contractual rights, as Owner may require for the purpose
of fully vesting in Owner all rights, title and interests of Contractor in and to all subcontracts, purchase orders, warranties, guarantees and other agreements pertaining to the Work; (ii) Contractor’s executing and delivering to Owner
all waivers and releases, in form and substance acceptable to Owner, required to establish that the Systems, the Facility and the Site, and any and all interests, estates or improvements related thereto, are free from any and all claims, liens,
security interests or encumbrances arising out of or in connection with performance by Contractor or any Subcontractor of the Work; (iii) Contractor’s delivering to Owner any other information reasonably requested by Owner; and
(iv) Contractor’s delivery to Owner of assignments of any agreements with Subcontractors for which Owner requests assignment.
23.4.4      Return of Security In the event of termination for convenience pursuant to this Section 23.4, and subject to
all of the rights of the Parties under the Contract Documents, (i) Owner shall return the original Letter of Credit issued by Contractor pursuant to Section 22.2 to Contractor for cancellation; (ii) Contractor shall return the
original Letter of Credit issued by Owner pursuant to Section 22.4 to Owner for cancellation; (iii) Owner shall return the original Payment and Performance Bond issued by Contractor pursuant to Section 22.3 to Contractor for
cancellation; and (iv) Owner shall pay all undisputed retainage to Contractor. Upon request of either Party, the exchange of Letters of Credit and Payment and Performance Bonds pursuant to subparts (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be
simultaneous.

Contractor Event of Default occurs, then Owner may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy Owner may have under this Agreement and notwithstanding any other provision under this Agreement, at any time terminate all or any part of this
Agreement, such termination becoming effective seven (7) calendar days after notice thereof is provided from Owner to Contractor. For purposes hereof, a “Contractor Event of Default” will be deemed to have occurred if:

Upon such termination or partial termination Owner may take possession of the applicable
portion of the Site and of the applicable materials, equipment (including, without limitation, Construction Equipment and Systems Equipment) and tools thereon owned by Contractor, may take assignment of the applicable Contractor’s agreements
with Subcontractors, and may finish the applicable Work by whatever method Owner may deem expedient. If the costs of finishing the applicable Work exceed the unpaid balance of the Contract Price for such Work, then Contractor will pay the
difference to Owner, subject to the provisions relating to limitations of liability and cost sharing set forth in this Agreement. Such right of termination for cause and right to take possession shall be in addition to and not in limitation of
Owner’s other rights and remedies under the Agreement or, should Owner have exhausted any non-exclusive specific remedy under this Agreement, under law or equity.
23.6        Actions Upon Termination . Upon receipt of written notice from Owner of termination of this Agreement pursuant to either Section 23.4

Equipment and the Systems (in whatever stage of completion); and (iii) terminate all existing subcontracts and purchase orders for the portion of the Work terminated (unless and to the extent Owner directs Contractor to assign such subcontracts
and/or purchase orders to Owner pursuant to Section 23.4.3) and enter into no further subcontracts and purchase orders in connection with the Work.
23.7        Survival . Termination of this Agreement will not relieve Contractor of any obligation hereunder which expressly or by implication survives

incurred by or asserted against any Owner Indemnitee arising out of (i) the release or threatened release by Contractor or its Subcontractors, of any Hazardous Substances on the Site or any areas adjacent thereto that are brought onto the site
by Contractor or its Subcontractors, (ii) the violation by Contractor or its Subcontractors of any Applicable Laws and/or Applicable Permits, (iii) any claim or allegation that any Systems Equipment, Construction Equipment or other
equipment, materials or information provided by Contractor or any Subcontractor in connection with its performance of the Work constitutes an infringement of any patent, trade mark, trade secret or confidential information, copyright or proprietary
rights of any kind belonging to or claimed by any third party, or (iv) any Subcontractor liens, claims of lien or similar encumbrances arising in connection with any Subcontractor claims.
28.8        No Limitation to Workers’ Benefits . In any and all claims against any
Owner Indemnitee or any of their agents or employees by any employee of Contractor or any Subcontractor, the indemnification obligation under Section 28.6 above will not be limited in any way by any limitation on the amount or type of damages,
compensation or benefits payable by or for Contractor or any Subcontractor under workers’ or workmen’s compensation acts, disability benefit acts or other employee benefit acts.
29. GOVERNING LAW
This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. without giving effect to any choice of law ruled thereof which may direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Subject to the
Dispute resolution Article 33, any action arising out of, or related to, this Agreement or the Project shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, New York, U.S.A. and the Parties
consent to jurisdiction and venue in such court.
30. PERMITTING
30.1        Responsibility for Permitting . Responsibility for permitting is set forth
in Exhibit 4. For permits for which Owner is responsible, Contractor shall provide technical support and reasonable assistance in support of Owner’s application for such permits. For permits for which Contractor is responsible, Owner
shall provide reasonable assistance in support of Contractor’s application for such Applicable Permits.


102








30.1.1      Owner’s Permits Required for Construction . With respect to each FGD System, Owner shall obtain all permits as required for construction for which it
is responsible on or before September 1, 2007. Should Owner fail to obtain such permits by such date, then by Change Order pursuant to Sections 19.7 and 19.13, and subject to Section 19.16, the milestone identified in Exhibit 15 as
“Ready for Flue Gas to Scrubber” and the Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date for such System shall each be extended day-for-day for each day of delay in obtaining such permits.
30.1.2      Permission to Begin Installation of
Pilings With respect to each FGD Systems, Owner shall use good faith efforts to obtain permission for Contractor to begin installing the necessary piles at the Site on or before August 1, 2007. Should Owner fail to obtain such permission,
then by Change Order pursuant to Sections 19.7 and 19.13, and subject to Section 19.16, the milestone identified in Exhibit 15 as “Ready for Flue Gas to Scrubber” and the Guaranteed Provisional Acceptance Date for such System shall
each be extended day-for-day for each day of delay in obtaining such permission.
30.2        Other Permits . To the extent that any permits are required that are not listed in Exhibit 4, then Owner will obtain and pay for all environmental and operating permits, and
Contractor will obtain and pay for all construction permits.
31. SITE CONDITIONS
31.1        Geotechnical Study . The Contractor shall perform and have full
responsibility for the comprehensive geotechnical study (the “Geotechnical Study” ) which shall indicate the results of Contractor’s full investigation, discovery, and conclusions regarding the subsurface conditions and all
other geotechnical issues at the Site. The findings and conclusions of the Geotechnical Study shall be incorporated into the design of the Project.
31.2        Special Site Characteristics . Prior to issuance of NTP, Contractor shall thoroughly inspect the Site and fully familiarize itself with the
structures, features, characteristics and conditions of the available working space and the ongoing operations of the Facility. Contractor shall ascertain the most suitable means and methods for executing and delivering the Work in accordance with
this Agreement, and shall employ such means throughout its performance of the Work.
31.3        Contractor’s Knowledge of Conditions . Contractor will be responsible for having taken all steps necessary to ascertain the suitability of the location of the Work, and
the general and local conditions which may affect the Work or the scheduling or cost thereof. Failure by Contractor to fully acquaint itself with all conditions which may affect the Work, such as transportation, handling, storage of materials,
normal weather patterns and ambient conditions, Applicable Laws, Applicable Permits, Taxes, insurance, and the character and availability of labor, consumables, supplies, Systems Equipment,



103









Construction Equipment, the nature and timing of work being performed by other contractors and the facilities needed preliminary to and during the performance of the Work, will not relieve
Contractor of its responsibilities under this Agreement.
31.4        Sub-Surface
Site Conditions . Contractor agrees that each Site is or will be made by Contractor satisfactory for performance of the Work in accordance with the Approved Project Schedule and for the Contract Price (except as the Approved Project
Schedule and Contract Price may be adjusted in accordance with Article 19). Contractor expressly assumes the risk of any sub-surface conditions relating to soils, water, or rock that may affect the performance of the Work that could reasonably
have been deduced from or revealed by the Geotechnical Study described in Section 31.1 of this Agreement.
32. SUBCONTRACTORS

32.1        Approved Subcontractors . Owner will have the right to
approve any and all Subcontractors from whom Contractor or its Subcontractors may obtain bids to subcontract portions of the Work. In no case shall Owner’s approval of any subcontract impose on Owner any responsibility for the Work or relieve
Contractor of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Owner’s approval of Contractor’s proposed Subcontractors of any tier will not be unreasonably withheld. If Contractor receives a disapproval notice for any Subcontractor it
shall not use or utilize such Subcontractor. Those approved Subcontractors are listed in Exhibit 1. Contractor may also have portions of the Work performed by its affiliates, in which event the Work shall be awarded by competitive sourcing and shall
be subject to all provisions of Article 10.
32.2        Subcontractor and Vendor
Identification. Prior to issuance of the NTP, Contractor shall identify all equipment and erection Subcontractors or potential Subcontractors that Contractor will employ to complete the Work. Contractor shall not add any additional
Subcontractors after issuance of the NTP without Owner’s prior approval.
32.3        Substitute Contractors. If Contractor proposes to substitute a non-preapproved subsupplier, the subsupplier’s credentials shall be submitted to Owner for
approval. Sufficient data must be provided to Owner in a timely manner to prove that the proposed equipment is of an equivalent quality and has proven operation in similar service conditions, including capacity, to that provided by the
pre-approved subsuppliers. If an offshore subsupplier is proposed, contractor shall provide information providing satisfactory domestic stockpiling of any required spare parts.
32.4        Purchase Orders and Subcontracts . Except as otherwise expressly agreed or
directed by Owner, Contractor will ensure that each Subcontractor with whom Contractor has a direct contract is bound to Contractor to the same extent that Contractor is bound to Owner hereunder. Contractor will use in connection with the Work such
Contractor-prepared purchase orders, contracts, subcontracts, material requisitions, terms and conditions and similar purchasing forms as are generally used from time to time by Contractor, however, these forms shall be designed to facilitate an
Open Book analysis of



104









underlying costs related to the Work. As a condition to Final Completion, Contractor will provide Owner with copies of all purchase orders, contracts, subcontracts and material requisitions
relating to such System (unpriced for any Work being performed on a lump sum pricing method). Contractor shall purchase the DCS equipment and software on the terms and conditions for purchase of same by Owner pursuant to the Master Agreement
between Mirant Services LLC and Invensys Systems, Inc dated March 26, 2007, (the “ DCS Master Agreement ”) a copy of which was provided to Contractor prior to the Effective Date. Contractor’s responsibility to Owner under
this Agreement for the DCS equipment shall be equal to but no higher than the obligations of the DCS Contractor for the DCS Equipment under the DCS Master Agreement.
32.5        Subcontractor Warranties . Except as otherwise expressly agreed or directed by Owner in writing, Contractor will procure from suppliers
standard warranties and guarantees with respect to the Systems Equipment. Notwithstanding any failure of Contractor to obtain such a warranty from a supplier, the Parts and Labor Warranty shall apply to all Systems Equipment. If, and to the
extent, that Owner is not able to effectuate a warranty remedy from the Contractor, where Contractor has subcontracted such services, then Owner may contact and prosecute such warranty services from such Subcontractor. As a condition to the
achievement of Final Completion, and/or prior to the termination of this Agreement, Contractor will (i) assign in writing all such warranties and guarantees to Owner; (ii) secure any consents necessary for such assignment from each
Subcontractor; and (iii) deliver to Owner copies of all contracts and subcontracts (unpriced for any Work being performed on a lump sum pricing method) providing for warranties and guarantees enforceable by Owner. Neither Contractor, nor its
Subcontractors will take any action which could release, void, impair or waive any warranties or guarantees on Systems Equipment, materials or services that it procures from others.
32.6        Subcontractor Insurance . Except as otherwise agreed or directed by Owner in
writing, Contractor will require all Subcontractors with whom Contractor has a direct contract to obtain, maintain and keep in force (and to require from their lower tier Subcontractors to obtain, maintain and keep in force) during the time in which
they are engaged by Contractor similar insurance coverages, if and as applicable to their respective scopes of services and activities as are required of Contractor pursuant to Section 25.1. The limits for such coverage may be reduced by the
Contractor in which case the Contractor agrees to be solely responsible to Owner, the Financing Parties, claimants or employees for any otherwise un-recovered losses which fall in the area between the required Subcontractor coverage and that which
is actually procured and maintained. Furthermore, Contractor will require of its subcontractors that the policies providing such coverages meet the same requirements as are applicable to Contractor’s policies, as set forth in Article 25.

32.7        No Privity with Subcontractors . Other than subsequent to an
assignment of a subcontract or purchase order to Owner, Owner will not be deemed by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise to have any contractual obligation to or relationship with any Subcontractor. Furthermore, no Subcontractor will have any
rights against Owner under



105









this Agreement, whether as a third party beneficiary or otherwise. Contractor will include clauses that expressly state the concepts set forth in this Section 32.7 in each subcontract with
Subcontractors.
32.8        Assignment of Subcontracts to Owner . In the event
of termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, Contractor shall assign any or all of its agreements with Subcontractors to Owner at Owner’s request and shall ensure that each such subcontract is assignable to Owner. In the event
of partial termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, Contractor shall assign the applicable agreements with Subcontractors to Owner at Owner’s request and shall ensure that each such subcontract is assignable to Owner
32.9        Directed Payments . From the monies paid by Owner to Contractor, Contractor shall
make payment to Subcontractors, to utilities furnished and Taxes owed by Contractor, to the payment of premiums on surety bonds and insurance, and to any other purpose related to the Project. The Contractor agrees that any liquidating agreement,
pass-through agreement, or other agreement between the Contractor and a Subcontractor that purports to make Owner responsible for paying a Subcontractor for work on the Project is void and unenforceable and deemed to be waived.
32.10      Neglect to Pay . Should Contractor neglect or refuse to pay promptly when due any legitimate
or undisputed bill incurred by it pursuant to the Agreement, Owner, after giving Contractor seven (7) calendar days’ notice of its intentions so to do, shall have the right but not the obligation, to pay such bill by joint check made
payable to Contractor and the applicable Subcontractor and such payments shall be accounted for as a payment to Contractor. Owner shall be entitled to offset such amounts against any payments thereafter becoming due to Contractor. The
payment of any bill by Owner pursuant to the foregoing shall not be deemed to cure or waive Contractor’s default, and Owner may exercise any other right or remedy granted by the Agreement or by law or equity. Owner will not make any such
payment, however, without prior consultation with Contractor concerning Contractor’s reason for refusing to pay such bill.
33. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
33.1        Applicability of
Resolution Procedures . All claims, disputes or other matters in question between the Parties arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement ( “Disputes” ) will be resolved pursuant to this Article 33.
33.2        Management Discussions . The Parties agree to make a diligent, good-faith attempt
to resolve all Disputes. If the Authorized Representatives of the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute arising under this Agreement within ten (10) calendar days after notice from one Party to the other, such Dispute will be submitted
promptly to the senior executive officers of the Parties, who will meet, in person or by telephone, not later than ten (10) calendar days after the date such Dispute was submitted to them. In the event that the officers cannot resolve the
Dispute within five (5) Business Days after the matter is submitted to them, then, unless otherwise agreed, the Parties will refer such Dispute to mediation proceedings under Section 33.3.


106








33.3        Mediation . Provided that
the Parties have been unable to resolve a Dispute pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 33.2, the Parties will make a good faith effort to mediate a resolution of the dispute with the assistance of a qualified mediator to be chosen by
agreement of the Parties. In the event that the Parties are unable to agree upon a qualified mediator, a mediator will be designated by the American Arbitration Association ( “AAA” ). Any such mediation will be held in
accordance with the Construction Industry Mediation Rules of the AAA or by such other standards as established by the mediator. Such mediation will be held in Atlanta, Georgia or at such other site as the Parties may agree. If, despite the
Parties’ good faith efforts to mediate a Dispute, such Dispute remains unresolved forty-five (45) calendar days after the first date on which such mediation commenced (or such longer period as the Parties may agree to in writing), then the
Parties may pursue such rights and remedies as may be available under applicable law.
33.4        Arbitration . Should a mediation under Section 33.3 be unsuccessful, and so long as the aggregate amount of all disputed Changes, Change Order Notices, Change Order Requests,
Change Orders, and other Disputes, claims, controversies or other matters disputed in good faith between the Parties at one time is equal to or less than twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), then all such Disputes, controversies or claims
arising out of or related to the Project shall be settled by mandatory and binding “baseball” arbitration in accordance with this Section 33.4, and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof;
provided, however, that should such aggregate amount exceed twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), then arbitration shall not be mandatory and the Parties may elect, by mutual agreement in writing, to have none, any or all such Disputes,
controversies or claims decided by binding or non-binding arbitration, as may be agreed by the Parties. The Parties agree that they will not assert frivolous claims in bad faith in an effort to subvert the purpose of the preceding sentence, which is
to establish an objective standard for distinguishing between situations in which arbitration is mandatory, and situations in which arbitration is not mandatory and will be used only upon agreement of the Parties. Any arbitration pursuant to this
Section 33.4 shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia and conducted pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act (2000). The arbitration shall be heard by three arbitrators, who shall be appointed using the process for the selection of the members of
the DRB, and who shall strictly enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event of such arbitration, each Party agrees to produce to the other Party all non-privileged documents that such other Party considers to be related to the
Dispute, including all electronic documents and data in native format. Provided that the other Party is provided a reasonable opportunity to obtain and preserve such electronic data before a Party ceases to maintain it, the requirement that
data be provided in native format shall apply only so long as that electronic data is still maintained in the ordinary course of business. All such documents shall be produced at least six months before the date set for the hearing, and the
initial production shall be supplemented promptly to include any additional documents that come into possession of a Party after the initial production. Each Party shall also provide to the other Party, at least forty-five (45) days before
the hearing or such shorter period as the arbitrators may direct upon application of a Party (but not less than 30 days before the



107









hearing), (i) a copy of all exhibits the Party will introduce at hearing, and a (ii) complete list of all witnesses the Party may call and a detailed summary of their testimony,
including a written report of all expert witnesses in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B). Documents that have not previously been exchanged, and witnesses for whom proper information has not previously been provided, may not be
considered by the arbitrators without a showing of good cause. The attorneys for the Parties and the arbitrators shall have the authority to issue subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses at the hearing and for production of documents
(including documents in the possession of persons other than the Parties) at or in advance of the hearing. At least fifteen (15) days before the date set for the hearing, the Parties will exchange, and provide to the arbitrators, best and
final offers of compromise, which the Parties may amend at any time before the tenth (10 th ) day after the close of the hearing. Within forty-five (45) days after the conclusion of the hearing, the arbitrators shall select the best and final
offer (as amended) of one Party and that offer shall become the award of the arbitrators. At the discretion of Owner, any Subcontractor with whom the Contractor has a direct contract may be joined as a party to an arbitration conducted pursuant to
this Section 33.4. Contractor shall include in each of its subcontracts, to the extent commercially practicable, a provision allowing for such joinder at Owner’s discretion, and an agreement by the Subcontractor to be bound by the
results of such arbitration. Should any Subcontractor oppose the inclusion of such provisions in its subcontract, and should the negotiations between Contractor and such Subcontractor reach an impasse, Contractor will consult with Owner to
determine a commercially reasonable course of action before entering into a subcontract or issuing a purchase order to such Subcontractor.
33.5        Dispute Review Board . Notwithstanding Sections 33.3 and 33.4, either Party may, at any time, submit a Dispute for interim decision by the
Dispute Review Board ( “DRB” ) in accordance with Exhibit 17. Should a Dispute arise that involves the subject matter of Sections 8.6, 19.15, 23.3 33.5, 12.3.5 or 12.6.4, then the Parties agree to abide by any decision of
the DRB relating to same on an interim basis, until the disagreement can be permanently resolved through the procedure described in this Article 33. The Parties agree that the Parties will suffer irreparable harm if either Party does not abide
by a decision of the DRB relating to the Sections listed in the previous sentence, and that either Party may enforce such a decision of the DRB through an action for equitable relief including mandatory temporary injunction.
33.6        Obligations Continue . Notwithstanding the existence of any Dispute
hereunder, the Parties will continue to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree in writing. If during the pendency of a Dispute, the Work is in progress, Owner’s Authorized
Representative will give such instructions as are necessary for the proper performance of the Work and to prevent delays pending settlement of the Dispute. Contractor will carry out such instructions and will proceed with the execution of the
Work, it being understood that in so doing Contractor, if it gives Owner a written notice before carrying out such Work that Contractor is doing so under protest, is not jeopardizing any claim it may have and is not in any way renouncing or waiving
any rights or recourses.


108








33.7        Injunctive Relief
.. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement is intended to, nor shall it, prevent the Parties from seeking injunctive relief at any time as may be available under law or in equity.
33.8        Survival . The provisions of this Article 33 will survive the termination of
this Agreement.
34. MISCELLANEOUS
34.1        Audit and Maintenance of Records . Owner shall have the right to audit and inspect Contractor’s records and accounts covering Fees and costs
paid, payable or reimbursable hereunder for Work performed on an Open Book basis, at all reasonable times during the performance of the Work and for such time as may be required by Applicable law, but in no event less than one year, after the
expiration or termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that the purpose of any such audit shall be only for verification of such costs. If an audit reveals that errors have been made in connection with the Fees, costs and other charges
invoiced to Owner, then the parties will work together to correct the error and any overpayments revealed by the audit will be promptly paid by Contractor to Owner. In addition, if the audit reveals any overpayment that is greater than five
percent (5%) of the amount which was actually due for the period being audited, Contractor, subject to the opportunity to dispute the audit findings in good faith, shall bear the cost of the audit.
34.2        Rights to Work Product .
34.2.1        Deliverables . All copies of the
paid-up Drawings and other deliverables provided or prepared under this Agreement, including, without limitation, Systems designs, and any sealed original drawings, specifications, final project specific calculations, computer-aided design and
drafting (CADD) data and files, and other engineering documents which Contractor prepares or delivers to Owner pursuant to this Agreement ( “Deliverables” ) shall be the property of Owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all
Deliverables are Instruments of Service of Contractor and Contractor shall retain all of its intellectual property rights in and to such Deliverables.
34.2.2        License . Contractor hereby grants to Owner and its affiliates a fully paid-up, royalty-free, irrevocable,
non-exclusive license to use, modify, display, copy, and reproduce the Deliverables to the extent Owner or its affiliates deem necessary to construct, operate, maintain, repair, or alter the Systems at the Sites. This license grant includes,
without limitation, a license under all current and future patents owned by or licensed to Contractor that would be infringed by or are applicable to the Deliverables and/or any such construction, operation, maintenance, repair or alternation of the
Systems at the Facilities.
34.2.3        Reuse . All Deliverables prepared by Contractor pursuant to this Agreement are not intended or represented to be suitable for reuse by Owner or



109









others in connection with any air quality control system for any sites other than the Sites. Any such reuse without prior written verification or adaptation by Contractor for the specific
purpose intended will be at Owner’s sole risk and without liability or legal exposure to Contractor. Owner shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contractor and its employees, agents, officers and/or assigns, against all claims,
losses, damages, injuries, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or resulting from such reuse.
34.3        Compliance with Laws .
34.3.1        Familiarity with Laws . Contractor shall be familiar with and, at all times, comply with and observe, all Applicable Laws, including all applicable
federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and executive orders; all applicable safety orders, all orders, or decrees, of administrative agencies, courts, or other legally constituted authorities having jurisdiction or authority
over Contractor or the Work which may be in effect now, or during performance of the Work.
34.3.2        No Fees or Commissions . Contractor has not employed or retained any company or person, other than a bona fide employee working solely for Contractor
to solicit or secure this Agreement and Contractor has not paid or agreed to pay any person, company, corporation, individual, or firm other than a bona fide employee working solely for Contractor, any fee, commission, percentage, gift, or any other
consideration contingent upon or resulting from the award or making this Agreement.
34.4        Authorized Representatives . Each Party will appoint its own “Authorized Representative” and notify the other Party in writing of such representative’s
name, address, facsimile and telephone number within five (5) calendar days after the execution of this Agreement. Either Party may, at any time, change the designation of its Authorized Representative, provided such Party will promptly
notify the other Party in writing of such change.
34.5        Confidentiality
..
34.5.1        Confidential
Information . From time to time, in connection with the Project and/or the Work a Party (the “Disclosing Party” ) may disclose certain written information to the other Party (the “Receiving Party” ) which
is clearly marked or otherwise designated as “CONFIDENTIAL” (such information, the “Confidential Information” ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include (i) information which is
now in the public domain, or which later enters the public domain, through no action by a party in violation of this Agreement; (ii) information which the Receiving Party can demonstrate was already in the Receiving Party’s possession at
the time of its disclosure, and which was not acquired by that party directly or indirectly from the Disclosing Party on a confidential basis; or (iii) information which was acquired from



110









persons not under an obligation of secrecy (whether legal or contractual) to the Disclosing Party.
34.5.2        Nondisclosure . The parties agree that the Confidential Information will be kept confidential by them during the
term of this Agreement, and in addition that certain identified parts of the Confidential Information shall be kept and remain confidential for a ten (10) year period following Final Completion of each plant’s
Facility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information to those of its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, consultants, lenders, potential lenders and advisors who need to know the
Confidential Information in order to assist that party in connection with the Project or the financing thereof. Each party agrees to be responsible for the actions and disclosures of any such person with respect to Confidential Information.

34.5.3        Compelled Disclosure
.. If a Receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, that party will provide the Disclosing Party with immediate written notice of that requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy at the Disclosing Party’s risk and expense. The Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required, and the Receiving Party will cooperate with the
Disclosing Party’s counsel to enable the Disclosing Party to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.
34.5.4        Use Restrictions . Owner will only
use the Confidential Information of Contractor for or in connection with the Project and the testing, operation, maintenance and repair of the Facilities.
34.6  Owner Caused Project End Suspension and Other Owner Caused Events
34.6.1 “ Owner Caused Project End Suspension” shall be deemed to have occurred if: (i) more than eighty percent (80%) of the Milestones have been completed; (ii) Owner suspends the Work pursuant to
Section 23 of this Agreement, and (iii) such suspension is for reasons other than Force Majeure, the discovery and required treatment of Hazardous Substances, Differing Site Conditions or Changes in Applicable Law; acts of omissions of the
Contractor that are in breach of its obligations under this agreement; or any other excused basis under this Agreement that would compel the Owner to effectuate such a suspension or delay.
Within fifteen (15) business days after delivery of the notice of the Owner Caused Project End Suspension , Owner shall deposit into a specific
escrow account an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of retention related to completed and undisputed milestones. Contractor shall be entitled to any and all interest from the specific escrow account (the “Escrow
Account”).


111








Should all or a significant portion of the Work be recommenced subsequent to a Owner Caused Project End
Suspension , all of the proceeds of the escrow account shall revert back to Owner upon the delivery to the contractor of an official “recommencement of the work” Notice (“Recommencement Notice”)
In the event that a Recommencement Notice has not been delivered to Contractor within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the first day of the
Owner Caused Project End Suspension , then all of the Escrow Account funds, including all interest, shall be distributed to Contractor.
In addition to Contractor’s other rights and entitlements under the Agreement in connection with an Owner suspension, should a Recommencement Notice be delivered to Contractor after the expiration of the above- described one hundred
eighty (180) day period, the Contractor hereby agrees and covenants that it shall return to Owner One Hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount of the escrowed funds within five (5) business days after receipt of the
Recommencement Notice.
34.6.2.      Owner has no duty or obligation to seek an extension of any of the time
limitations imposed by Maryland Department of Environmental Conservation (“DEC”) or any other regulatory rulings or requirements related to the Facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should (i) the time limits imposed by the
DEC or any other regulatory agencies related to the Facilities for one or more of the Facilities be extended; (ii) Owner intentionally interferes with or frustrates Contractor’s efforts to achieve Provisional Acceptance, Substantial
Completion or Final Completion within the time provided in the Approved Project Schedule; and (iii) Contractor demonstrates that, at the time of the interference, Owner had a financial incentive to pursue recovery of liquidated damages for late
completion rather than allow Contractor to complete the Work within the time allowed, then for the time period of such Owner interference, Contractor shall not be assessed any liquidated damages relating to Provisional Acceptance, Substantial
Completion or Final Completion within the time provided in the Approved Project Schedule.
34.7          Notices . All notices permitted or required to be given under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed duly given when sent by overnight courier, by
personal delivery (against receipt) or on the third (3rd) calendar day following the date on which such notice is deposited, postage prepaid, in the United States mail, certified, return receipt requested. All notices will be delivered or
sent to the Parties at their respective address(es) shown below or to such other address(es) as a Party may designate by prior written notice given in accordance with this provision to the other Party:

113









independent contractor in the performance of this Agreement, maintaining complete control of its personnel, workers, Subcontractors and operations required for performance of the Work. This
Agreement will not be construed to create any relationship, contractual or otherwise, between Owner and any Subcontractor.
34.9        Amendments . Except as provided in Article 19, no amendments or modifications of this Agreement will be valid unless evidenced in writing and signed by a duly authorized
representative of the Party against which enforcement is sought.

SECTION ONE – FGD GUARANTEES
MORGANTOWN


1.	 GUARANTEES AND PERFORMANCE TESTS




1.1	 The following items of performance for the FGD systems shall be guaranteed based on the total range of design conditions herein specified. The FGD
system must be capable of simultaneously meeting all guarantees unless otherwise noted within this document (i.e., the availability guarantee).


The general arrangement of equipment furnished by the Contractor shall not be less favorable than indicated on the Contractor’s General Arrangement drawing
122492-00000-M-GA-001-1-G. Should the arrangements change, any performance guarantees affected (i.e., power consumption) shall be modified as mutually agreed by the Contractor and the Owner.
The equipment shall have been erected in accordance with the Contractor’s plans and specifications, shall have been
properly maintained by the Owner, and operated within the operating conditions as specified in Exhibit 1 and in a manner consistent with the Contractor’s recommendations and Operating Instructions and Manuals.
The Contractor offers only the guarantees listed in this section of the proposal. These performance
guarantees do not include occurrences of aluminum fluoride blinding. If Aluminum fluoride deactivation is observed via depressed operating pH, decreased SO2 removal, poor gypsum quality, and high limestone stoichiometry, then the performance and availability tests will be
delayed until operation returns to normal. Credit shall retained by Contractor for all previous performance guarantees achieved up to the point where aluminum fluoride blinding is confirmed and testing delayed (if required).
In the event that excessive foaming (defined as detection of slurry and/or foam from the absorber overflow when all other
operating parameters per the O&M manual are within design range) occurs in the proposed equipment, a suitable surfactant or defoaming agent shall be used to attempt to correct the condition before any damages or other penalties are applied.

Failure to meet any one of the below specified performance guarantees shall not require re-testing of all
performance guarantees. Re-testing shall be limited to the failed performance guarantees and any directly related guarantees in accordance with item 2.1.5.
The following guarantees are offered in accordance with the design data included in Exhibit 1.


1.1.1	 SO2 Removal. For each unit, Contractor shall guarantee the maximum SO2 emission level in the flue gas stream out of the desulfurization system
when less than or equal to the parameters defined in Exhibit 1, while using the in-situ forced oxidation limestone operating mode without the use of performance enhancing additives such as organic acids. This emission level shall be met at all
operating points and during load changes and shall be based on the heat input to the boiler at that operating load. A minimum SO2 emission of *** shall constitute fulfillment of the SO2 emission level guarantee. Also,







July 19, 2007	  	Page 2 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Morgantown





for each unit, a minimum SO2 removal efficiency of *** shall be guaranteed at all operating loads (without organic acid additives) when firing the evaluation coal within the range of constituents and maximum SO2 loading defined in Exhibit 1, while using the in situ forced oxidation
limestone operating mode and without the use of performance enhancing additives such as organic acids. For purposes of Exhibit 1 and performance guarantees, lb SO2/mmBtu shall be calculated using the procedure described by the EPA in the Federal
Register.


SO2 removal efficiency is defined as:



% SO2 Removal =	 	(SO2 at absorber inlet (lb/hr) - SO2 at absorber outlet (lb/hr))	 	x100
SO2 at absorber inlet (lb/hr)

Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test PA and
Performance Test 1. The Equivalent Availability Test will be based on a *** weighted rolling average. Figure 1 shall be used for correction of guarantee values for operating conditions other than the maximum flue gas flow described in Exhibit 1.
Subject to mutual agreement between the Parties Performance Test 1 may be conducted simultaneously with the Provisional Acceptance Test.
***

Exhibit 6	  	Morgantown




1.1.2	 Particulate Emission Level. For each unit, the solid filterable particulate emission level in the chimney shall not exceed the level
at the desulfurization system inlet. This includes inlet particulate levels between *** and ***. If the inlet value is below *** and the total ammonia, as free ammonia or ammonia salts, at the absorber inlet is equivalent to *** dry volume,
corrected to ***, or less, the outlet level shall not exceed ***. This solid filterable particulate emission level shall include fly ash, calcium salts and other inerts or materials, except acid mist and water in uncombined form, that are or have
been airborne, and exist as a solid at standard conditions. The emission level shall be met at all operating points as defined in Exhibit 1.


Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test PA and Performance Test 1. Subject to mutual agreement between the Parties, Performance Test 1 may be
conducted simultaneously with the Provisional Acceptance Test.


1.1.3	 Pressure Drop. Contractor shall guarantee a pressure drop of *** water column (per absorber) through the FGD system for the maximum
flue gas flow, while operating as defined in Exhibit 1. This value is calculated from the FGD absorber inlet to the absorber outlet (flange to flange). The mist eliminator and all ducts must be in a normal operating clean condition based on
Contractor’s recommended mist eliminator cleaning cycle.


Compliance with this
requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test 1. The test ports shall be located in Contractor’s duct as close to the absorber inlet as possible and in Contractor’s absorber module outlet duct.
In the event that test results reveal that an accurate and reliable measurement of pressure drop cannot be taken because of
turbulence or other related reasons, the location of the measuring points shall be changed and suitable adjustments, subject to Owner’s approval, made to the guaranteed pressure drop to reflect the new location.
The above pressure drop guarantee is based on the spare absorber recycle pump being out of service. The spare absorber
recycle pump is the upper-most installed spray header pump in each absorber module. Figure 2 shall be used for correction of guarantee values for operating conditions other than the maximum flue gas flow described in Exhibit 1.
***


1.1.4	 Maximum Entrained Moisture Carryover. For each unit, the Maximum Entrained Moisture Carryover from the absorbers, as measured at the
absorber outlet shall be an average of no more than *** as averaged over the absorber cross section at the mist eliminator level, excluding acid mist in the calculation. The test port locations for this guarantee shall be mutually agreed upon
between Contractor and Owner. Test ports shall be provided by Contractor.




1.1.5	 Power Consumption. Contractor shall guarantee that the Power Consumption at the motor or other affected device leads excluding booster
fan power, , and gypsum







July 19, 2007	  	Page 4 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Morgantown





dewatering requirements (averaged over a *** operating period) for equipment supplied by the Contractor at the Maximum gas flow for the evaluation coal fuel shall not exceed ***. The power
consumption with one spare absorber recycle pump per absorber out of service as required per the specification is not expected to exceed ***. This consumption is based on normal operating process (Contractor’s Scope) equipment in service,
including the absorber area with both absorbers in operation, with air compressors, as well as the mist eliminator wash water pumps, FGD makeup water pumps, and the limestone preparation system, and is based on ambient site conditions and service
water temperatures as defined in Exhibit 1. It excludes line losses, switch gear losses, transformer losses and standby services such as the spare slurry, absorber recycle and water pumps, isolation valves, lighting and instruments, heat tracing,
HVAC, and spare equipment. Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test 1.




1.1.6	 Make Up Water Consumption. Total makeup water consumption – For each unit, the total makeup water consumption (gpm) for the
maximum SO2 loading case (in Exhibit 1) shall be guaranteed
by Contractor not to exceed *** per absorber for the Limestone Milling System, AR Pump Gear Cooling and Seal Flushing, Mist Eliminator Washing, and Oxidation Air Humidification, as averaged over a *** period. This guarantee excludes water usage from
any non-process related water users not specifically required for operation of the FGD System, such as hose stations and equipment wash downs, or any abnormal, non-steady state plant operations, such as filling a tank. This guarantee includes an
allowance of *** for the Wastewater Treatment System. To the extent it is different from the allowance, the overall guarantee must be adjusted accordingly with Owner’s approval. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. This guarantee
excludes gypsum dewatering requirements.


The above guarantee values apply to the *** flue gas design case
as specified in Exhibit 1, the design chloride concentration *** and the design limestone as described in Exhibit 1.


1.1.7	 Limestone Consumption. For each unit, Contractor shall guarantee that the Limestone Consumption will not exceed *** (on a dry solids
basis) per absorber for the gas flow per 4.1.2 of Exhibit 1. In addition to the SO2 removal requirement, the guaranteed Limestone Consumption shall include the additional limestone consumed during removal of chlorine and fluorine in the flue gas (based on the design conditions in
Exhibit 1). Adjustments will be made to the guaranteed limestone consumption using Contractor’s correction curve (Figure 3) in the event of deviations in the content (or reactivity) of CaCO3. Moreover, an adjustment in limestone consumption using Contractor’s correction curve (Figure 3) will
be made in the event sulfur levels differ from those present in the evaluation fuel.


Compliance with this
requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test 1.
The above guarantee value applies to the *** flue gas design
case as specified in Exhibit 1, and the design limestone as described in Exhibit 1. To determine the guaranteed limestone consumption at different flue gas flow rates, limestone composition values or other design points, guarantee correction curves
as provided by the Contractor shall be used.

Contractor’s absorber bleed stream.


Compliance with the above requirement shall be
demonstrated during Performance Test 1.
Provisional Acceptance Testing
To achieve Provisional Acceptance, Contractor shall guarantee that the oxidation level of the absorber bleed stream
gypsum product shall be equal or greater than *** at Maximum gas flow and design SO2 operation.
Contractor’s guarantee is conditioned upon the Owner returning
the reclaim stream from the Dewatering System to the absorber with the following properties:


•	 	 The reclaim stream oxidation level shall be a minimum of ***.


Compliance with the above requirement shall be demonstrated during the Performance Test PA.

July 19, 2007	  	Page 18 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Morgantown




a.16	 Limestone reactivity & calcium carbonate content: The calcium carbonate content will be determined by EPRI methodology J1. The results of
this test will be used in conjunction with the gravimetric feeder measurement to determine limestone consumption. Limestone reactivity will be determined by the Contractor’s method.




5.1.2	         Pretest Records




a.	 Dimensions and physical conditions of the equipment required for calculations or other test purposes shall be determined and recorded prior to the
test. Serial numbers and data from nameplates should be recorded to identify the equipment tested. All instrumentation should be identified and model and serial numbers recorded.




5.1.3	         Protection of Instrument Uncertainty




a.	 Instrumentation used for data collection must be at least as accurate as instrumentation identified in the pretest uncertainty analysis. This
instrumentation can either be permanent plant instrumentation or temporary test instrumentation. Total uncertainty in measurements shall be no greater than that recommended in ASME PTC-40.




b.	 Multiple instruments should be used as needed to reduce overall test uncertainty. The frequency of data collection is dependent on the particular
measurement and the duration of the test. To the extent practical, multiple readings should be collected to minimize the random error impact on the post-test uncertainty analysis. The use of automated data acquisition systems is recommended to
facilitate acquiring sufficient data.




c.	 Contractor shall coordinate with plant on the timing of installation of calibrated devices, but in all cases, the calibration shall have been within
*** of the performance test. Calibration or adequate checks of all instruments, including those already installed and operating at the plant, prior to and after the test must be carried out by Contractor, and those records and calibration reports
must be made available and included in the Test Report. Following the test, re-calibration or adequate reconfirmation or verification is required.




5.1.4	         Testing Instrumentation and Equipment Inspection and Cleanliness




a.	 Prior to conducting a test, the cleanliness and condition of the testing instrumentation and equipment shall be determined by visual inspection or
review of operational records, or both, and witnessed by all parties.




5.1.5	         Preliminary Operation and Adjustment




a.	 Before starting the performance test, the equipment shall be operated for sufficient time to demonstrate mechanical operation and stable control of
the operating variable. During the period, instruments shall be checked.




5.1.6	         Preliminary Testing






July 19, 2007	  	Page19 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Morgantown




a.	 Preliminary testing shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of the overall performance test to allow time to calculate preliminary
results, make final adjustments, and modify the test requirements and/or test equipment. Results from the preliminary testing should be calculated and reviewed to identify any problems with the quantity and quality of measured data. The parties
shall mutually agree before the test to any test modifications, so determined. A preliminary test run may be accepted as a final test run by mutual agreement of all parties.


5.2 Conduct of Test


5.2.1	         Specified Reference Conditions




a.	 These conditions are defined by the guarantees or objectives of the test and they form the baseline for the output corrections. Every effort should
be made to run the test under the specified conditions or as close to the specified conditions as possible, in order to minimize the effect of corrections. Test points shall be duplicated as closely as possible to those used for baseline testing of
the plant.




5.2.2	         Starting and Stopping Tests and Test Runs




a.	 The test coordinator is responsible for ensuring that all data collection begins at the agreed-upon start of the test, and that all parties to the
test are informed of the starting time.




b.	 Starting Criteria: prior to starting the performance test, the following conditions must be satisfied:




b.1	 Operation, configuration, and disposition for testing has been reached in accordance with the agreed upon test requirements, including:





b.1.1	 Equipment operation and method of control




b.1.2	 Availability of fuel within the allowable limits of the fuel analysis for the test (by analysis as soon as practicable preceding the test).





b.1.3	 Equipment operation within the manufacturer’s allowable limits and emissions within permitted limits.




b.2	 Stabilization: before starting the test, the equipment shall be run until stable conditions have been established. Stability will be achieved when
continuous monitoring indicates that the readings have been within the maximum permissible variation established by the manufacturer.




b.3	 Data Collection: data acquisition system(s) functioning, and test personnel in place and ready to collect samples or record data.





c.	 Completion Criteria




c.1	 Tests are normally concluded when the test coordinator is satisfied that requirements for a complete test run have been satisfied. The test
coordinator should verify that modes of operation during test, specified herein, have been







July 19, 2007	  	Page 20 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Morgantown





satisfied. The test coordinator may extend or terminate the test if the requirements are not met. If the test is interrupted due to circumstances beyond the control of the Contractor, such as
operator error, boiler upset, or electrical grid problems, the Contractor shall be allowed to restart testing after the interruption has been corrected. All test runs completed prior to the interruption shall be credited toward the test run. The
test data between the interruption and return to service shall not be considered as part of the data set.




5.2.3	         Operation Prior to and During Tests




a.	 All equipment necessary for normal and sustained operation at the specified conditions must be operated during the test or accounted for in the
corrections. Intermittent operation of equipment within the test boundary should be accounted for in a manner agreeable to all parties.




b.	 Auxiliary Equipment Operation: FGD booster fans, ME wash water pumps, and the seal air fan must be operating or accounted for in determining
auxiliary power loads.




c.	 Adjustments prior to and during Tests: prior to start of the actual test run, adjustments are permitted provided that stabilization as defined
herein is established. Once the test run has started, no adjustments are permitted except by agreement of all the parties to the test.




5.2.4	         Duration of Test Run and Frequency of Readings




a.	 The duration of a test run and the frequency of the readings shall be selected to provide a reliable average of the readings. A *** test run is
recommended to meet the uncertainty requirements. A test can be a single *** run or the average of a series of runs, each being separately corrected, then averaged. While this procedure does not require multiple runs, the advantages of multiple runs
should be recognized as providing a means for valid rejection of bad test runs, reducing average uncertainty and to verify the repeatability of results.


5.3 Test Records
5.3.1    Test Readings


a.	 To the extent possible, test readings shall be recorded on a data acquisition system. A complete set of unaltered data acquisition sheets and
recorded charts, electronic media or facsimiles thereof, shall become the property of each party to the test at the end of the test. The observations shall include the date and time of day. They shall be the actual readings without application of
any corrections. The log sheets and all recorded charts constitute a complete record.




5.3.2	         Direct Readings




a.	 Direct manual readings of instruments are to be recorded at uniform frequent intervals during a test. It is preferable to observe simultaneously all
instruments at the same intervals.






July 19, 2007	  	Page 21 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Morgantown




5.3.3	         Certified Data




a.	 It is recommended that data considered to be especially important be confirmed by a second observer.




5.3.4	         Test Log




a.	 Every event connected with the progress of a test, however unimportant it may appear at the time, should be recorded on the test log sheets together
with the time of occurrence and the name of the observer. Particular care should be taken to record any adjustments made to any equipment under test, whether made during a run or between runs. The reasons for each adjustment shall be stated in the
test records.




5.3.5	         Test Recording Errors




a.	 Manual data shall be recorded in ink. In case of errors in a recorded observation, a line shall be drawn in ink through the incorrect entry, the
correct reading is to be recorded in ink and initialed above the incorrect entry, and an explanation entered in the proper place in the test records. A comparison of these observations should be made as soon as possible and any discrepancies
reconciled before the end of the test.


5.4 Test Validity
5.4.1 Validity of Results


a.	 If, during the conduct of a test or during the subsequent analysis or interpretation of the observed data, an inconsistency is found which affects
the validity of the results, the parties should make every reasonable effort to adjust or eliminate the inconsistency by mutual agreement. Failure to reach such agreement will constitute rejection of the run or test.


5.4.2 Reporting of Results


a.	 In all cases, the test results shall be reported:




a.1	 As calculated from the test observations, with only instrument calibration adjustments applied




a.2	 As corrected for deviations of the test condition from the specified conditions.




5.4.3	         Causes for Rejection of Readings




a.	 Upon completion of test or during the test itself, the test data shall be reviewed to determine if any data should be rejected prior to the
calculation of test results. Should serious inconsistencies which affect the results be detected, the run shall be invalidated completely, or it may be invalidated only in part if the affected part is at the beginning or at the end of the run. Refer
to ASME PTC-19.1 for data rejection criteria.

CHALK POINT



1.	         GUARANTEES AND PERFORMANCE TESTS




1.1	 The following items of performance for the FGD systems shall be guaranteed based on the total range of design conditions herein specified. The FGD
system must be capable of simultaneously meeting all guarantees unless otherwise noted within this document (i.e., the availability guarantee).




The general arrangement of equipment furnished by the Contractor shall not be less favorable than indicated on the Contractor’s General
Arrangement drawing 122493-00000-M-GA-001-1-G. Should the arrangements change, any performance guarantees affected (i.e., power consumption) shall be modified as mutually agreed by the Contractor and the Owner.




The equipment shall have been erected in accordance with the Contractor’s plans and specifications, shall have been properly maintained by the
Owner, and operated within the operating conditions as specified in Exhibit 1 and in a manner consistent with the Contractor’s recommendations and Operating Instructions and Manuals.




The Contractor offers only the guarantees listed in this section of the proposal. These performance guarantees do not include occurrences of
aluminum fluoride blinding. If Aluminum fluoride deactivation is observed via depressed operating pH, decreased SO2
removal, poor gypsum quality, and high limestone stoichiometry, then the performance and availability tests will be delayed until operation returns to normal. Credit shall retained by
Contractor for all previous performance guarantees achieved up to the point where aluminum fluoride blinding is confirmed and testing delayed (if required).




In the event that excessive foaming (defined as detection of slurry and/or foam from the absorber overflow when all other operating parameters per
the O&M manual are within design range) occurs in the proposed equipment, a suitable surfactant or defoaming agent shall be used to attempt to correct the condition before any damages or other penalties are applied.





Failure to meet any one of the below specified performance guarantees shall not require re-testing of all performance guarantees. Re-testing shall
be limited to the failed performance guarantees and any directly related guarantees in accordance with item 2.1.5.




The following guarantees are offered in accordance with the design data included in Exhibit 1.




1.1.1	 SO2 Removal. For each unit, Contractor shall guarantee the maximum SO2 emission level in the flue gas stream out of the desulfurization system
when less than or equal to the parameters defined in Exhibit 1, while using the in-situ forced oxidation limestone operating mode without the use of performance enhancing additives such as organic acids. This emission level shall be met at all
operating points and during load changes and shall be based on the heat input to the boiler at that operating load. A minimum SO2 emission of *** shall constitute fulfillment of the SO2 emission level guarantee. Also, for each unit, a minimum SO2 removal efficiency of *** shall be guaranteed at all operating loads (without organic acid additives) when firing the
evaluation coal within







July 19, 2007	  	Page 26 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Chalk Point





the range of constituents and maximum SO2 loading defined in Exhibit 1, while using the in situ forced oxidation limestone operating mode and without the use of performance enhancing additives such as organic acids. For purposes of Exhibit 1 and
performance guarantees, lb SO2/mmBtu shall be calculated
using the procedure described by the EPA in the Federal Register.





SO2
removal efficiency is defined as:


% SO2 Removal  =	  	 (SO2 at absorber inlet (lb/hr) - SO2 at absorber outlet (lb/hr))
x100
SO2 at absorber inlet (lb/hr)



Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test PA and Performance Test 1. The Equivalent Availability Test will be
based on a *** weighted rolling average. Figure 1 shall be used for correction of guarantee values for operating conditions other than the maximum flue gas flow described in Exhibit 1. Subject to mutual agreement between the Parties Performance Test
1 may be conducted simultaneously with the Provisional Acceptance Test.


***


1.1.2	 Particulate Emission Level. For each unit, the solid filterable particulate emission level in the chimney shall not exceed the level
at the desulfurization system inlet. This includes inlet particulate levels between *** and ***. If the inlet value is below *** and the total ammonia, as free ammonia or ammonia salts, at the absorber inlet is equivalent to ***, corrected to ***,
or less, the outlet level shall not exceed ***. This solid filterable particulate emission level shall include fly ash, calcium salts and other inerts or materials, except acid mist and water in uncombined form, that are or have been airborne, and
exist as a solid at standard conditions. The emission level shall be met at all operating points as defined in Exhibit 1.

5.1.2	 Pretest Records




a.	 Dimensions and physical conditions of the equipment required for calculations or other test purposes shall be determined and recorded prior to the
test. Serial numbers and data from nameplates should be recorded to identify the equipment tested. All instrumentation should be identified and model and serial numbers recorded.




5.1.3	 Protection of Instrument Uncertainty




a.	 Instrumentation used for data collection must be at least as accurate as instrumentation identified in the pretest uncertainty analysis. This
instrumentation can either be permanent plant instrumentation or temporary test instrumentation. Total uncertainty in measurements shall be no greater than that recommended in ASME PTC-40.




b.	 Multiple instruments should be used as needed to reduce overall test uncertainty. The frequency of data collection is dependent on the particular
measurement and the duration of the test. To the extent practical, multiple readings should be collected to minimize the random error impact on the post-test uncertainty analysis. The use of automated data acquisition systems is recommended to
facilitate acquiring sufficient data.




c.	 Contractor shall coordinate with plant on the timing of installation of calibrated devices, but in all cases, the calibration shall have been within
*** of the performance test. Calibration or adequate checks of all instruments, including those already installed and operating at the plant, prior to and after the test must be carried out by Contractor, and those records and calibration reports
must be made available and included in the Test Report. Following the test, re-calibration or adequate reconfirmation or verification is required.




5.1.4	 Testing Instrumentation and Equipment Inspection and Cleanliness




a.	 Prior to conducting a test, the cleanliness and condition of the testing instrumentation and equipment shall be determined by visual inspection or
review of operational records, or both, and witnessed by all parties.




5.1.5	 Preliminary Operation and Adjustment




a.	 Before starting the performance test, the equipment shall be operated for sufficient time to demonstrate mechanical operation and stable control of
the operating variable. During the period, instruments shall be checked.




5.1.6	 Preliminary Testing






July 19, 2007	  	Page 42 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Chalk Point




a.	 Preliminary testing shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of the overall performance test to allow time to calculate preliminary
results, make final adjustments, and modify the test requirements and/or test equipment. Results from the preliminary testing should be calculated and reviewed to identify any problems with the quantity and quality of measured data. The parties
shall mutually agree before the test to any test modifications, so determined. A preliminary test run may be accepted as a final test run by mutual agreement of all parties.




5.2	 Conduct of Test




5.2.1	 Specified Reference Conditions




a.	 These conditions are defined by the guarantees or objectives of the test and they form the baseline for the output corrections. Every effort should
be made to run the test under the specified conditions or as close to the specified conditions as possible, in order to minimize the effect of corrections. Test points shall be duplicated as closely as possible to those used for baseline testing of
the plant.




5.2.2	 Starting and Stopping Tests and Test Runs




a.	 The test coordinator is responsible for ensuring that all data collection begins at the agreed-upon start of the test, and that all parties to the
test are informed of the starting time.




b.	 Starting Criteria: prior to starting the performance test, the following conditions must be satisfied:




b.1	 Operation, configuration, and disposition for testing has been reached in accordance with the agreed upon test requirements, including:





b.1.1	 Equipment operation and method of control




b.1.2	 Availability of fuel within the allowable limits of the fuel analysis for the test (by analysis as soon as practicable preceding the test).





b.1.3	 Equipment operation within the manufacturer’s allowable limits and emissions within permitted limits.




b.2	 Stabilization: before starting the test, the equipment shall be run until stable conditions have been established. Stability will be achieved when
continuous monitoring indicates that the readings have been within the maximum permissible variation established by the manufacturer.




b.3	 Data Collection: data acquisition system(s) functioning, and test personnel in place and ready to collect samples or record data.





c.	 Completion Criteria




c.1	 Tests are normally concluded when the test coordinator is satisfied that requirements for a complete test run have been satisfied. The test
coordinator should verify that modes of operation during test, specified herein, have been







July 19, 2007	  	Page 43 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Chalk Point





satisfied. The test coordinator may extend or terminate the test if the requirements are not met. If the test is interrupted due to circumstances beyond the control of the Contractor, such as
operator error, boiler upset, or electrical grid problems, the Contractor shall be allowed to restart testing after the interruption has been corrected. All test runs completed prior to the interruption shall be credited toward the test run. The
test data between the interruption and return to service shall not be considered as part of the data set.




5.2.3	 Operation Prior to and During Tests




a.	 All equipment necessary for normal and sustained operation at the specified conditions must be operated during the test or accounted for in the
corrections. Intermittent operation of equipment within the test boundary should be accounted for in a manner agreeable to all parties.




b.	 Auxiliary Equipment Operation: FGD booster fans, ME wash water pumps, and the seal air fan must be operating or accounted for in determining
auxiliary power loads.




c.	 Adjustments Prior to and during Tests: prior to start of the actual test run, adjustments are permitted provided that stabilization as defined
herein is established. Once the test run has started, no adjustments are permitted except by agreement of all the parties to the test.




5.2.4	 Duration of Test Run and Frequency of Readings




a.	 The duration of a test run and the frequency of the readings shall be selected to provide a reliable average of the readings. A *** test run is
recommended to meet the uncertainty requirements. A test can be a single *** run or the average of a series of runs, each being separately corrected, then averaged. While this procedure does not require multiple runs, the advantages of multiple runs
should be recognized as providing a means for valid rejection of bad test runs, reducing average uncertainty and to verify the repeatability of results.




5.3	 Test Records




5.3.1	 Test Readings




a.	 To the extent possible, test readings shall be recorded on a data acquisition system. A complete set of unaltered data acquisition sheets and
recorded charts, electronic media or facsimiles thereof, shall become the property of each party to the test at the end of the test. The observations shall include the date and time of day. They shall be the actual readings without application of
any corrections. The log sheets and all recorded charts constitute a complete record.




5.3.2	 Direct Readings




a.	 Direct manual readings of instruments are to be recorded at uniform frequent intervals during a test. It is preferable to observe simultaneously all
instruments at the same intervals.






July 19, 2007	  	Page 44 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Chalk Point




5.3.3	 Certified Data




a.	 It is recommended that data considered to be especially important be confirmed by a second observer.




5.3.4	 Test Log




a.	 Every event connected with the progress of a test, however unimportant it may appear at the time, should be recorded on the test log sheets together
with the time of occurrence and the name of the observer. Particular care should be taken to record any adjustments made to any equipment under test, whether made during a run or between runs. The reasons for each adjustment shall be stated in the
test records.




5.3.5	 Test Recording Errors




a.	 Manual data shall be recorded in ink. In case of errors in a recorded observation, a line shall be drawn in ink through the incorrect entry, the
correct reading is to be recorded in ink and initialed above the incorrect entry, and an explanation entered in the proper place in the test records. A comparison of these observations should be made as soon as possible and any discrepancies
reconciled before the end of the test.




5.4	 Test Validity




5.4.1	 Validity of Results




a.	 If, during the conduct of a test or during the subsequent analysis or interpretation of the observed data, an inconsistency is found which affects
the validity of the results, the parties should make every reasonable effort to adjust or eliminate the inconsistency by mutual agreement. Failure to reach such agreement will constitute rejection of the run or test.




5.4.2	 Reporting of Results




a.	 In all cases, the test results shall be reported:




a.1	 As calculated from the test observations, with only instrument calibration adjustments applied




a.2	 As corrected for deviations of the test condition from the specified conditions.




5.4.3	 Causes for Rejection of Readings




a.	 Upon completion of test or during the test itself, the test data shall be reviewed to determine if any data should be rejected prior to the
calculation of test results. Should serious inconsistencies which affect the results be detected, the run shall be invalidated completely, or it may be invalidated only in part if the affected part is at the beginning or at the end of the run. Refer
to ASME PTC-19.1 for data rejection criteria.

1.	 GUARANTEES AND PERFORMANCE TESTS




1.1	 The following items of performance for the FGD systems shall be guaranteed based on the total range of design conditions herein specified. The FGD
system must be capable of simultaneously meeting all guarantees unless otherwise noted within this document (i.e., the availability guarantee).




The general arrangement of equipment furnished by the Contractor shall not be less favorable than indicated on the Contractor’s General
Arrangement drawing 122491-00000-M-/ga-001-1-G. Should the arrangements change, any performance guarantees affected (i.e., power consumption) shall be modified as mutually agreed by the Contractor and the Owner.




The equipment shall have been erected in accordance with the Contractor’s plans and specifications, shall have been properly maintained by the
Owner, and operated within the operating conditions as specified in Exhibit 1 and in a manner consistent with the Contractor’s recommendations and Operating Instructions and Manuals.




The Contractor offers only the guarantees listed in this section of the proposal. These performance guarantees do not include occurrences of
aluminum fluoride blinding. If Aluminum fluoride deactivation is observed via depressed operating pH, decreased SO2
removal, poor gypsum quality, and high limestone stoichiometry, then the performance and availability tests will be delayed until operation returns to normal. Credit shall retained by
Contractor for all previous performance guarantees achieved up to the point where aluminum fluoride blinding is confirmed and testing delayed (if required).




In the event that excessive foaming (defined as detection of slurry and/or foam from the absorber overflow when all other operating parameters per
the O&M manual are within design range) occurs in the proposed equipment, a suitable surfactant or defoaming agent shall be used to attempt to correct the condition before any damages or other penalties are applied.





Failure to meet any one of the below specified performance guarantees shall not require re-testing of all performance guarantees. Re-testing shall
be limited to the failed performance guarantees and any directly related guarantees in accordance with item 2.1.5.




The following guarantees are offered in accordance with the design data included in Exhibit 1.




1.1.1	 SO2 Removal.   For each unit, Contractor shall guarantee the maximum SO
2 emission level in the flue gas stream out of the
desulfurization system when less than or equal to the parameters defined in Exhibit 1, while using the in-situ forced oxidation limestone operating mode without the use of performance enhancing additives such as organic acids. This emission level
shall be met at all operating points and during load changes and shall be based on the heat input to the boiler at that operating load. A minimum SO2 emission of *** shall constitute fulfillment of the SO2 emission level guarantee. Also, for each unit, a minimum SO2 removal efficiency of *** shall be guaranteed at all operating loads (without organic acid additives) when firing the
evaluation coal within







July 19, 2007	  	Page 49 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Dickerson





the range of constituents and maximum SO2 loading defined in Exhibit 1, while using the in situ forced oxidation limestone operating mode and without the use of performance enhancing additives such as organic acids. For purposes of Exhibit 1 and
performance guarantees, lb SO2/mmBtu shall be calculated
using the procedure described by the EPA in the Federal Register.





SO2
removal efficiency is defined as:


% SO2 Removal  =	  	 (SO2 at absorber inlet (lb/hr) - SO2 at absorber outlet (lb/hr))
x100
SO2 at absorber inlet (lb/hr)



Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test PA and Performance Test 1. The Equivalent Availability Test will be
based on a *** weighted rolling average. Figure 1 shall be used for correction of guarantee values for operating conditions other than the maximum flue gas flow described in Exhibit 1. Subject to mutual agreement between the Parties Performance Test
1 may be conducted simultaneously with the Provisional Acceptance Test.


***


1.1.2	 Particulate Emission Level. For each unit, the solid filterable particulate emission level in the chimney shall not exceed the level
at the desulfurization system inlet. This includes inlet particulate levels between *** and ***. If the inlet value is below *** and the total ammonia, as free ammonia or ammonia salts, at the absorber inlet is equivalent to *** volume, corrected to
*** O2, or less, the outlet level shall not exceed ***. This
solid filterable particulate emission level shall include fly ash, calcium salts and other inerts or materials, except acid mist and water in uncombined form, that are or have been airborne, and exist as a solid at standard conditions. The emission
level shall be met at all operating points as defined in Exhibit 1.




Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test PA and Performance Test 1. Subject to mutual agreement between the
Parties, Performance Test 1 may be conducted simultaneously with the Provisional Acceptance Test.




1.1.3	 Pressure Drop. Contractor shall guarantee a pressure drop of *** water column (per absorber) through the FGD system for the maximum
flue gas flow, while operating as defined in Exhibit 1. This value is calculated from the FGD absorber inlet to the absorber outlet (flange to flange). The mist eliminator and all ducts must be in a normal operating clean condition based on
Contractor’s recommended mist eliminator cleaning cycle.




Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test 1. The test ports shall be located in Contractor’s duct as close
to the absorber inlet as possible and in Contractor’s absorber module outlet duct.




In the event that test results reveal that an accurate and reliable measurement of pressure drop cannot be taken because of turbulence or other
related reasons, the location of the







July 19, 2007	  	Page 50 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Dickerson





measuring points shall be changed and suitable adjustments, subject to Owner’s approval, made to the guaranteed pressure drop to reflect the new location.




The above pressure drop guarantee is based on the spare absorber recycle pump being out of service. The spare absorber recycle pump is the
upper-most installed spray header pump in each absorber module. Figure 2 shall be used for correction of guarantee values for operating conditions other than the maximum flue gas flow described in Exhibit 1.


***


1.1.4	 Maximum Entrained Moisture Carryover. For each unit, the Maximum Entrained Moisture Carryover from the absorbers, as measured at the
absorber outlet shall be an average of no more than *** as averaged over the absorber cross section at the mist eliminator level, excluding acid mist in the calculation. The test port locations for this guarantee shall be mutually agreed upon
between Contractor and Owner. Test ports shall be provided by Contractor.




1.1.5	 Power Consumption. Contractor shall guarantee that the Power Consumption at the motor or other affected device leads excluding booster
fan power and gypsum dewatering requirements (averaged over a *** operating period) for equipment supplied by the Contractor at the Maximum gas flow for the evaluation coal fuel shall not exceed ***. The power consumption with one spare absorber
recycle pump out of service is not expected to exceed ***. This consumption is based on normal operating process (Contractor’s Scope) equipment in service, including the absorber area with air compressors, as well as the mist eliminator wash
water pumps, FGD makeup water pumps, and the limestone preparation system and is based on ambient site conditions and service water temperatures as defined in Exhibit 1. It excludes line losses, switch gear losses, transformer losses and standby
services such as the spare slurry, absorber recycle and water pumps, isolation valves, lighting and instruments, heat tracing, HVAC, and spare equipment. Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test 1.





1.1.6	 Make Up Water Consumption. Total makeup water consumption – For each unit, the total makeup water consumption (gpm) for the
maximum SO2 loading case (in Exhibit 1) shall be guaranteed
by Contractor not to exceed *** per absorber for the Limestone Milling System, AR Pump Gear Cooling and Seal Flushing, Mist Eliminator Washing, and Oxidation Air Humidification, as averaged over a *** period. This guarantee excludes water usage from
any non-process related water users not specifically required for operation of the FGD System, such as hose stations and equipment wash downs, or any abnormal, non-steady state plant operations, such as filling a tank. This guarantee includes an
allowance of *** for the Wastewater Treatment System. To the extent it is different from the allowance, the overall guarantee must be adjusted accordingly with Owner’s approval. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. This guarantee
excludes gypsum dewatering requirements.




The above guarantee values apply to the *** flue gas design case as specified in Exhibit 1, the design chloride concentration *** and the design
limestone as described in Exhibit 1.






July 19, 2007	  	Page 51 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Dickerson




1.1.7	 Limestone Consumption. For each unit, Contractor shall guarantee that the Limestone Consumption will not exceed *** (on a dry solids
basis) per absorber for the gas flow per 4.3.2 of Exhibit 1. In addition to the SO2 removal requirement, the guaranteed Limestone Consumption shall include the additional limestone consumed during removal of chlorine and fluorine in the flue gas (based on the design conditions in
Exhibit 1). Adjustments will be made to the guaranteed limestone consumption using Contractor’s correction curve (Figure 3) in the event of deviations in the content (or reactivity) of CaCO3. Moreover, an adjustment in limestone consumption using Contractor’s correction curve (Figure 3) will
be made in the event sulfur levels differ from those present in the evaluation fuel.




Compliance with this requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test 1.




The above guarantee value applies to the *** flue gas design case as specified in Exhibit 1, and the design limestone as described in Exhibit 1. To
determine the guaranteed limestone consumption at different flue gas flow rates, limestone composition values or other design points, guarantee correction curves as provided by the Contractor shall be used.


***


1.1.8	 Engineering Design Margin The engineering design margin (the “Engineering Design Margins”) for the guaranteed
consumption of auxiliary power, limestone and makeup water is ***.




1.1.9	 Minimum Turndown Capability. The FGD system shall be warranted to a minimum turndown capability (defined as operating at greater than
or equal to *** of the gas flow as defined in Exhibit 1) as a percentage of full-load. Minimum turndown capability shall be ***.




1.1.10	 Calcium Sulfite Oxidation. For each unit, Contractor shall guarantee that the oxidation level of the absorber bleed stream gypsum
product shall be equal or greater than *** at Maximum gas flow and design SO2 operation. Oxidation level is calculated by dividing the total moles of calcium sulfate (CaSO4 · 2 H2O) by the sum of the total moles of calcium sulfite (CaSO3 ·  1/2 H2O) and calcium sulfate in the absorber bleed stream solids from the absorber, expressed as a percentage. In addition, the soluble sulfite concentration for each unit shall be a maximum of ***.





Contractor’s guarantee is conditioned upon the Owner returning the reclaim stream from the Dewatering System to the absorber with the following
properties:




•	 	 The reclaim stream oxidation level shall be a minimum of ***.




•	 	 The *** average mass flow of CaSO3 ·  1/2 H2O in the reclaim stream shall not exceed *** of the mass flow of CaSO3
·  1/2 H2O in the
Contractor’s absorber bleed stream.




Compliance with the above requirement shall be demonstrated during Performance Test 1.

***, under free field hemispherical radiation conditions as measured *** horizontally from a vertical surface, defined by a parallelepiped that just encloses the equipment under test, and *** above a floor or normal walkway. When acoustical
enclosures are provided, all measurements shall be made *** horizontally from the enclosure wall. Corrections will be made for background noise. If the measurement area is determined to be less than free field, mutually agreed upon room constant
corrections shall be applied. All measurements will be energy averaged into a single value. The performance test to determine compliance with the stated guarantee shall be conducted in accordance with ANSl S1.13. Noise measurements shall have a ***
tolerance as stated within the ANSl standards. Other corrections not covered by this standard will be as mutually agreed to by the Contractor and Owner.

5.	TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION



5.1	 Preparations for Test




5.1.1	 Applicable Testing Methods/Codes




a.	 The tests conducted for Performance Test 1 shall be run in strict accordance with the latest editions of the ASME PTC4.3 and EPA Methods 1
through 6, 8, and 17 in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 40, Part 60, Appendix A (40 CFR 60 Appendix A). All parties to the test shall be given timely notification to allow them the necessary time
to respond and to prepare personnel, equipment, or documentation. All calculation procedures, such as limestone consumption, water consumption, etc., shall be defined in accordance with the testing codes herein.




a.1	 EPA Method 1 shall be used to determine number and location of sampling traverse points for both particulate and sulfur dioxide sampling.





a.2	 EPA Method 5b or 17 shall be used at the existing particulate control outlet and EPA Method 5b shall be used at the stack location for
particulate sampling. Particulate sampling shall be for a minimum of *** per point; however, each test run shall be at least *** in duration. Particulate measurements shall exclude condensables. Mist eliminator carryover is to be determined /
confirmed during flow modeling and will not be measured during Performance Test 1.




a.3	 Combining the appropriate EPA methods may permit simultaneous acquisition of particulate and sulfur dioxide samples. However, this procedure must be
allowed in the current reference methods to be considered valid.




a.4	 An integrated multi-point sample for Orsat analysis shall be obtained at each test station for each test run.




a.5	 Fuel samples will be taken by the Owner. The samples will be taken at such times as to ensure that they are representative samples of the fuel
burned during







July 19, 2007	  	Page 63 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Dickerson





the tests. The Owner will divide each sample into *** equal parts. The Contractor shall be responsible for the sample analysis, which shall be conducted in accordance with the latest edition of
ASTM D3176, D3180, and D2015. *** sample shall be analyzed by the Contractor per the above while the *** shall be held by Contractor for future use if required.




a.6	 Gas flow rate to the FGD system shall be calculated per ASME PTC4.3 using the ultimate analysis of the fuel, boiler heat input rate, and the
analysis of the flue gas at the FGD system inlet. The gas flow rate obtained by the pitot tube method shall be calculated for each location and recorded in the final report for information only. Owner will obtain the necessary data for calculation
of boiler heat input during the performance test. The Contractor shall obtain all other data. The gas flow rate determined through the use of ASME PTC4.3 (stoichiometric) shall be used to determine the amount of gas being treated by the FGD system
for comparison to the design flow rate.




a.7	 Particulate loading in gr/dscf and pounds per million Btu, and sulfur dioxide loading in ppm and pounds per million Btu shall be calculated
according to the “F” factor method given in the referenced Federal Register. The “F” factor shall be calculated as defined in the Federal Register from the coal ultimate analysis and the gross calorific value determined from coal
samples obtained during the testing. A separate “F” factor shall be calculated and used in the computation of results for each individual test run. Particulate and sulfur dioxide values shall be corrected to a constant oxygen and moisture
level.




a.8	 Particulate and sulfur dioxide removal efficiencies shall be calculated based on the absorber inlet values and the stack values for each test run.
The arithmetic average of the results from the *** test runs shall be used to compare with the contract guarantees. *** out of the *** samples may be disregarded if the data is considered to be an outlier.




a.9	 Oxidation level: *** samples of slurry shall be taken by Contractor from the absorber reaction tank via the absorber bleed pump suction sample
stations during each of the test runs. The samples shall be decanted, washed and dried in an oven at ***. This will minimize the effect of chlorides on the stoichiometric ratio analysis. *** sample shall be analyzed by the Contractor using the
Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI) FGD Chemistry and Analytical Methods CS-3612. The dried solids shall be analyzed using the following EPRI methods; Method L2 or a mutually agreeable test method for sulfate and Method M2 for
sulfite. The remaining samples shall be retained by the Contractor for future analysis, if required. A likewise sample of the reclaim return stream shall be collected and analyzed to determine sulfate and sulfite levels. The absorber bleed slurry
and the reclaim stream shall be evaluated using the following test methods:

other standard publications are to the latest issue of each as of the date of the Agreement unless specifically stated otherwise.




a.13	 Deleted.




a.14	 Solids content: Method 13 shall be utilized to determine percent solids.




a.15	 Mercury: The mercury at the inlet and outlet of the wet FGD system shall be measured utilizing the Ontario Hydro Method. The inlet and outlet
concentrations (in lb/Trillion BTU) shall be used to calculate the mercury removal efficiency.




a.16	 Limestone reactivity & calcium carbonate content: The calcium carbonate content will be determined by EPRI methodology J1. The results of
this test will be used in conjunction with the gravimetric feeder measurement to determine limestone consumption. Limestone reactivity will be determined by the Contractor’s method.




5.1.2	 Pretest Records




a.	 Dimensions and physical conditions of the equipment required for calculations or other test purposes shall be determined and recorded prior to the
test. Serial numbers and data from nameplates should be recorded to identify the equipment tested. All instrumentation should be identified and model and serial numbers recorded.




5.1.3	 Protection of Instrument Uncertainty




a.	 Instrumentation used for data collection must be at least as accurate as instrumentation identified in the pretest uncertainty analysis. This
instrumentation can either be permanent plant instrumentation or temporary test instrumentation. Total uncertainty in measurements shall be no greater than that recommended in ASME PTC-40.






July 19, 2007	  	Page 65 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Dickerson




b.	 Multiple instruments should be used as needed to reduce overall test uncertainty. The frequency of data collection is dependent on the particular
measurement and the duration of the test. To the extent practical, multiple readings should be collected to minimize the random error impact on the post-test uncertainty analysis. The use of automated data acquisition systems is recommended to
facilitate acquiring sufficient data.




c.	 Contractor shall coordinate with plant on the timing of installation of calibrated devices, but in all cases, the calibration shall have been within
*** months of the performance test. Calibration or adequate checks of all instruments, including those already installed and operating at the plant, prior to and after the test must be carried out by Contractor, and those records and calibration
reports must be made available and included in the Test Report. Following the test, re-calibration or adequate reconfirmation or verification is required.




5.1.4	 Testing Instrumentation and Equipment Inspection and Cleanliness




a.	 Prior to conducting a test, the cleanliness and condition of the testing instrumentation and equipment shall be determined by visual inspection or
review of operational records, or both, and witnessed by all parties.




5.1.5	 Preliminary Operation and Adjustment




a.	 Before starting the performance test, the equipment shall be operated for sufficient time to demonstrate mechanical operation and stable control of
the operating variable. During the period, instruments shall be checked.




5.1.6	 Preliminary Testing




a.	 Preliminary testing shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of the overall performance test to allow time to calculate preliminary
results, make final adjustments, and modify the test requirements and/or test equipment. Results from the preliminary testing should be calculated and reviewed to identify any problems with the quantity and quality of measured data. The parties
shall mutually agree before the test to any test modifications, so determined. A preliminary test run may be accepted as a final test run by mutual agreement of all parties.




5.2	 Conduct of Test




5.2.1	 Specified Reference Conditions




a.	 These conditions are defined by the guarantees or objectives of the test and they form the baseline for the output corrections. Every effort should
be made to run the test under the specified conditions or as close to the specified conditions as possible, in order to minimize the effect of corrections. Test points shall be duplicated as closely as possible to those used for baseline testing of
the plant.




5.2.2	 Starting and Stopping Tests and Test Runs







July 19, 2007	  	Page 66 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Dickerson




a.	 The test coordinator is responsible for ensuring that all data collection begins at the agreed-upon start of the test, and that all parties to the
test are informed of the starting time.




b.	 Starting Criteria: prior to starting the performance test, the following conditions must be satisfied:




b.1	 Operation, configuration, and disposition for testing has been reached in accordance with the agreed upon test requirements, including:





b.1.1	 Equipment operation and method of control




b.1.2	 Availability of fuel within the allowable limits of the fuel analysis for the test (by analysis as soon as practicable preceding the test).





b.1.3	 Equipment operation within the manufacturer’s allowable limits and emissions within permitted limits.




b.2	 Stabilization: before starting the test, the equipment shall be run until stable conditions have been established. Stability will be achieved when
continuous monitoring indicates that the readings have been within the maximum permissible variation established by the manufacturer.




b.3	 Data Collection: data acquisition system(s) functioning, and test personnel in place and ready to collect samples or record data.





c.	 Completion Criteria




c.1	 Tests are normally concluded when the test coordinator is satisfied that requirements for a complete test run have been satisfied. The test
coordinator should verify that modes of operation during test, specified herein, have been satisfied. The test coordinator may extend or terminate the test if the requirements are not met. If the test is interrupted due to circumstances beyond the
control of the Contractor, such as operator error, boiler upset, or electrical grid problems, the Contractor shall be allowed to restart testing after the interruption has been corrected. All test runs completed prior to the interruption shall be
credited toward the test run. The test data between the interruption and return to service shall not be considered as part of the data set.




5.2.3	 Operation Prior to and During Tests




a.	 All equipment necessary for normal and sustained operation at the specified conditions must be operated during the test or accounted for in the
corrections. Intermittent operation of equipment within the test boundary should be accounted for in a manner agreeable to all parties.




b.	 Auxiliary Equipment Operation: FGD booster fans, ME wash water pumps, and the seal air fan must be operating or accounted for in determining
auxiliary power loads.




c.	 Adjustments Prior to and during Tests: prior to start of the actual test run, adjustments are permitted provided that stabilization as defined
herein is







July 19, 2007	  	Page 67 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Dickerson





established. Once the test run has started, no adjustments are permitted except by agreement of all the parties to the test.




5.2.4	 Duration of Test Run and Frequency of Readings




a.	 The duration of a test run and the frequency of the readings shall be selected to provide a reliable average of the readings. A *** test run is
recommended to meet the uncertainty requirements. A test can be a single *** run or the average of a series of runs, each being separately corrected, then averaged. While this procedure does not require multiple runs, the advantages of multiple runs
should be recognized as providing a means for valid rejection of bad test runs, reducing average uncertainty and to verify the repeatability of results.




5.3	 Test Records




5.3.1	 Test Readings




a.	 To the extent possible, test readings shall be recorded on a data acquisition system. A complete set of unaltered data acquisition sheets and
recorded charts, electronic media or facsimiles thereof, shall become the property of each party to the test at the end of the test. The observations shall include the date and time of day. They shall be the actual readings without application of
any corrections. The log sheets and all recorded charts constitute a complete record.




5.3.2	 Direct Readings




a.	 Direct manual readings of instruments are to be recorded at uniform frequent intervals during a test. It is preferable to observe simultaneously all
instruments at the same intervals.




5.3.3	 Certified Data




a.	 It is recommended that data considered to be especially important be confirmed by a second observer.




5.3.4	 Test Log




a.	 Every event connected with the progress of a test, however unimportant it may appear at the time, should be recorded on the test log sheets together
with the time of occurrence and the name of the observer. Particular care should be taken to record any adjustments made to any equipment under test, whether made during a run or between runs. The reasons for each adjustment shall be stated in the
test records.




5.3.5	 Test Recording Errors




a.	 Manual data shall be recorded in ink. In case of errors in a recorded observation, a line shall be drawn in ink through the incorrect entry, the
correct reading is to be recorded in ink and initialed above the incorrect entry, and an explanation entered in the proper place in the test records. A comparison of these observations should be made as soon as possible and any discrepancies
reconciled before the end of the test.






July 19, 2007	  	Page 68 of 72












Exhibit 6	  	Dickerson




5.4	 Test Validity




5.4.1	 Validity of Results




a.	 If, during the conduct of a test or during the subsequent analysis or interpretation of the observed data, an inconsistency is found which affects
the validity of the results, the parties should make every reasonable effort to adjust or eliminate the inconsistency by mutual agreement. Failure to reach such agreement will constitute rejection of the run or test.




5.4.2	 Reporting of Results




a.	 In all cases, the test results shall be reported:




a.1	 As calculated from the test observations, with only instrument calibration adjustments applied




a.2	 As corrected for deviations of the test condition from the specified conditions.




5.4.3	 Causes for Rejection of Readings




a.	 Upon completion of test or during the test itself, the test data shall be reviewed to determine if any data should be rejected prior to the
calculation of test results. Should serious inconsistencies which affect the results be detected, the run shall be invalidated completely, or it may be invalidated only in part if the affected part is at the beginning or at the end of the run. Refer
to ASME PTC-19.1 for data rejection criteria.




5.5	 Test Report




5.5.1	 General Requirements

proximity to their habitat.


2.	  	 The Target Cost does not include any costs
if any of the sites are identified as the location of any historic property.


3.	  	 The Target Cost assumes no wetlands
relocation, no endangered species or archeological artifacts.


4.	  	 The Target Cost does not include any fees

5.	  	 The Target Cost does not include any costs
for the Warranty Bond noted in Article 22.3. The Target Cost will be adjusted by Change Order to account for any amount Contractor may be required to pay. Such adjustment shall not be marked up for Fee or G&A.

the Owner refuses the payment tendered or the Surety has denied liability, in whole or in part, without further notice the Owner shall be entitled to enforce any remedy available to the Owner.

Exhibit 17
GUIDELINES FOR USE OF DISPUTE REVIEW BOARD
AND

THREE PARTY AGREEMENT







Exhibit 17
GUIDELINES FOR USE OF DISPUTE REVIEW BOARD
1.01 General


A.	Definitions

1.        Board – The Dispute Review Board.
2.        Contract – The Alliance Agreement and EPC Agreement of which these Guidelines are a part.
3.        Dispute – A claim, change order request, or other controversy that remains unresolved following good faith negotiations between authorized
representatives of the Owner and Contractor.
4.        Dispute Review Board – Three
neutral individuals mutually selected by the Owner and Contractor to consider and recommend resolution of Disputes referred to it.


B.	Summary

1.        A Dispute Review Board will be established to assist in the resolution of Disputes in connection with, or arising out of, performance of the work of this Contract.
2.        Either the Owner or the Contractor may refer a Dispute to the Board. Such referral should be
initiated as soon as it appears that the normal Owner-Contractor amicable dispute resolution effort through bilateral negotiations is not succeeding, and prior to filing of litigation by either party.
3.        Promptly thereafter, the Board will impartially consider the Dispute(s) referred to it. The Board will
provide a nonbinding written recommendation for resolution of the Dispute to the Owner and the Contractor.
4.        Although the recommendations of the Dispute Review Board should carry great weight for both the Owner and the Contractor, they are not binding on either party except to the extent provided
in Section 33.4 of the Contract.


C.	Scope

1.        These Guidelines describe the purpose, procedure, function, and features of the Dispute Review Board. A Three-Party Agreement among the Owner, Contractor, and three members using the form
and content of Attachment A will formalize creation of the Board and establish the scope of its service and the rights and responsibilities of the parties. In the event of a conflict between these Guidelines and the Three-Party Agreement, the latter
governs.


Last revised 7/19/06








Exhibit 17


D.	Purpose

1.        The Board, as an independent third party, will assist in and facilitate the timely and equitable resolution of disputes between the Owner and the Contractor in an effort to avoid acrimony,
construction delay, and more formal means of dispute resolution.
2.        Creation of the
Board is not intended to promote Owner or Contractor default on the responsibility of making a good-faith effort to settle amicably and fairly their differences by indiscriminate referral to the Board.


E.	Continuance of Work

1.        Both parties shall proceed diligently with the work and comply with all applicable Contract provisions while the Dispute Review Board considers a Dispute.


F.	Tenure of Board

1.        The Board will be deemed established after all parties execute the Three-Party Agreement,
2.        The Board will be dissolved as of the date of final payment to the Contractor unless earlier terminated or dissolved by mutual agreement of the Owner and Contractor.
1.02 Membership


A.	General

1.        The Dispute Review Board will consist of one member nominated by the Owner and approved by the Contractor, one member nominated by the Contractor and approved by the Owner, and a third
member nominated by the first two members and approved by both the Owner and the Contractor. The third member will serve as Chairman unless the parties otherwise agree. During the tenure of the Board, a party may change its nominated member by
notice to the other party, and the Board shall be recomposed for future disputes using the selection process contained in these Guidelines. If a member of the Board resigns or becomes otherwise unavailable during the hearings of a dispute, then the
parties shall immediately consult with each other regarding the mutually desired course of action, but in the absence of mutual agreement, the Board shall be recomposed using the selection process contained in these Guidelines and the dispute shall
be promptly taken up by the recomposed Board.


B.	Criteria

1.        Experience
a.        It is desirable that all Dispute Review Board members be experienced with the type of construction involved in the project, interpretation of contract documents, and resolution
of construction disputes.


Last revised 7/19/06








Exhibit 17
b.        The goal in selecting the third member is to complement the experience of the first two and to provide leadership of the Board’s
activities.
2.        Neutrality
a.        It is imperative that the Board members be neutral, act impartially, and be
free of any conflict of interest.
b.        For purposes of this
subparagraph, the term “member” also includes the member’s current primary or full-time employer, and “involved” means having a contractual relationship with either party to the Contract, such as a subcontractor, architect,
engineer, or construction manager.
c.        Prohibitions; disqualifying
relationships for prospective members:
(1)        an ownership interest
in any entity involved the Contract, or a financial interest in the Contract, except for payment for services on the Dispute Review Board;
(2)        previous employment by, or financial ties to, any party involved in the Contract within a period of 20 years prior to award of the Contract,
except for fee based consulting services on other projects;
(3)        a
close professional or personal relationship with any key member of any entity involved in the Contract which, in the judgment of either party, could suggest partiality; or
(4)        prior involvement in the project of a nature which could compromise that
member’s ability to participate impartially in the Board’s activities.
d.        Prohibitions; disqualifying relationships for members:
(1)        employment, including fee-based consulting services, by any entity involved in the Contract except with the express approval of both parties;
(2)        discussion concerning, or the making of, an agreement with any entity
involved in the Contract regarding employment after the Contract is completed.


C.	Disclosure Statement

As a part of the
selection process, the first two prospective members will be required to submit complete disclosure statements for the approval of both the Owner and the Contractor. Each statement shall include a résumé of experience, together with a
declaration describing all past, present, and anticipated or planned future relationships, including indirect relationships through the prospective members’ primary or full-time employer, to this project and with all parties involved in the
Contract, including subcontractors, design professionals, and consultants. Disclosure of close professional or personal relationships with all key members of all parties to the Contract shall be included. The third Board member will be required to
submit such a statement to the first two Board members and to the Owner and Contractor as a part of his selection and evaluation process.


Last revised 7/19/06

Contract award.
b.        If the nominee is not rejected within 2 weeks
after receipt of the name and disclosure statement, he shall be deemed approved.
c.        No reasons for rejection need be stated. In the event of rejection, the nominating party shall submit another nomination within 2 weeks of receipt of the notice of rejection.
This process will be repeated until two mutually acceptable members are named.
2.        Nomination
and approval of third member
a.        Upon approval of both of the first
two members, the Owner and the Contractor will notify them to begin selection of the third member. The first two members will endeavor to nominate a third member who meets all the criteria listed above. The third member shall be nominated within 4
weeks after the first two members are notified to proceed with his selection. The nominee’s name and disclosure statement will be conveyed to the Owner and the Contractor, who will either accept or reject the nominee within four weeks. No
reasons for rejection need be stated. In the event of rejection, the first two members will be requested to submit another nomination within two weeks of receipt of notice of rejection.
b.        In the event of an impasse in selection of the third member from nominees of
the first two members, the third member shall be selected by mutual agreement of the Owner and the Contractor. In so doing, they may, but are not required to, consider nominees offered by the first two members.


E.	Three-Party Agreement

prepare appropriate documentation.
2.         Procedures and time periods may be modified by
mutual agreement.


B.	Prerequisites to Review

Dispute is
subject to referral to the Board when either party believes that bilateral negotiations are not likely to succeed or have reached an impasse.


C.	Requesting Review

1.         Either party may refer a dispute to the Board. Requests for Board review shall be submitted in writing to the Chairman of the Dispute Review Board and shall state the Dispute in
connection with, or arising out of, performance of the work of this Contract which the parties have considered but have been unable to resolve. The Request for Review shall state clearly and in full detail the specific issues of the Dispute to be
considered by the Board and include a recommendation as to whether it may be heard at the next regular Board meeting or at a special meeting.
2.         A copy of the Request for Review shall be simultaneously provided to the other party who shall respond to the requesting party’s statement within 1 week.
3.         After conferring with both parties, the Board Chairman will establish a submittal schedule for the
parties to provide documentation in support of the hearings.

Request for Review.


Last revised 7/19/06








Exhibit 17


E.	Pre-hearing Requirements

1.         Concise written position statements shall be prepared by both parties, with page number references to any supporting documentation, and submitted to each Board member and to the other
party.
2.         A single and complete compilation of supporting documentation, with pages
consecutively numbered for ease of reference, is most desirable. The parties shall cooperate in compiling this documentation and submitting it to each Board member for review before the hearing.
3.         The party requesting the Board review shall submit its position statement first, followed by the
other party.


F.	Hearing

1.         Normally the hearing will be conducted at the job site. However, any location that would be more convenient and still provide all required facilities and access to necessary
documentation is satisfactory. Private sessions of the Board may be held at any convenient location.
2.         The third member of the Board will act as Chairman of the hearing, or he may appoint one of the other members.
3.         The Owner and the Contractor shall have representatives at all hearings. The Party requesting Board review will first present its position, followed
by the other party. Each party will be allowed successive rebuttals until all aspects are fully covered. The Board members and the parties may ask questions, request clarification, or ask for additional data. In difficult or complex cases,
additional hearings may be necessary in order to facilitate full consideration and understanding of all the evidence presented by both parties. Both the Owner and the Contractor shall be provided full and adequate opportunity to present all their
evidence, documentation, and testimony regarding all issues before the Board.
4.         Normally, a formal transcript will not be prepared. When requested by either party, the Board may allow recordation and transcription by a court reporter with the cost to be allocated
as agreed by the parties. Audio or video recordings will not be permitted.
5.         Attendance
by, or participation of, lawyers will be at the discretion of the Board.
6.         All hearings
are to be concluded by the Board within 4 weeks of the date of the start of the first hearing.

confidential from disclosure to others.


Last revised 7/19/06








Exhibit 17


H.	Recommendation

1.          The Board’s recommendation for resolution of the dispute will be provided in writing to both the Owner and the Contractor within 2 weeks of the completion of the hearings.
In difficult or complex cases, and in consideration of the Board’s schedule, this time may be extended by mutual agreement of all parties.


I.	Acceptance or Rejection

1.          Within 2 weeks of receiving the Board’s recommendation, or such other time specified by the Board, both the Owner and the Contractor shall provide written notice to the
other and to the Board of acceptance or rejection of the Board’s recommendation. The failure of either party to respond within the specified period shall be deemed an acceptance of the Board’s recommendation. If, with the aid of the
Board’s recommendation, the Owner and the Contractor are able to resolve their dispute, the Owner will promptly process any required Contract changes.


J.	Clarification and Reconsideration

1.          Should the dispute remain unresolved because of a bona fide lack of clear understanding of the recommendation, either party may request that the Board clarify specified portions
of its recommendation.
2.          If new evidence has become available, either party may
request that the Board reconsider its recommendation.


K.	Admissibility

1.          If the Board’s recommendation does not resolve the dispute, the written recommendation, including any minority report, will be admissible as evidence to the extent permitted
by law in any subsequent dispute resolution proceeding or forum to establish (a) that a Dispute Review Board considered the Dispute, (b) the qualifications of the Board members, and (c) the Board’s recommendation that resulted
from the process.


1.05	Payment

A.         The fees and expenses of all three members of the Board shall be shared equally by the Owner and the Contractor (Contractor’s share being an Allocable Cost under the Contract).

B.         The Owner, at its expense, will prepare and mail minutes and progress reports, and
provide administrative services such as conference facilities and secretarial services.
C.         If the Board desires special services such as legal or other consultation, accounting, data research, and the like, both parties must agree, and the costs will be shared by them as
mutually agreed.

3.





II.	Situation

A.         The Owner and Contractor are now engaged in the engineering, procurement and construction of the Air Quality Control Systems at Morgantown Generating Station, Dickerson Generating
Station and Chalk Point Generating Station.
B.         The Alliance Agreement between Owner and
Contractor and the EPC Agreement into which the Parties may enter (collectively the “Contract”) provides for the establishment and operation of a Dispute Review Board (“Board”) to assist in resolving Disputes as defined therein.



III.	Purpose

A. The objective of the Board
is to consider, fairly and impartially, the Disputes referred to it, and to provide written recommendations to the Owner and Contractor for resolution of these Disputes.


IV.	Scope of Work

The scope of work of the
Board includes, but is not limited to, the following:


A.	Project Site Visits

1.          In the case of an actual or potential dispute involving an alleged differing site condition or specific construction problem, it may be advantageous for the Board to view
personally any relevant conditions. If viewing by the Board would cause delay to the project, videos, photographs, and descriptions of these conditions, collected by either or both parties, will be utilized.


B.	Establish Procedures



Last revised 7/19/06








Exhibit 17
1.         During its first telephonic conference, the Board shall, with the agreement of all parties, establish procedures for the conduct of its routine site
visits and its hearings of disputes. The conduct of its business shall, in general, be based on the Specification provisions.
2.         It is not desirable to adopt hard-and-fast rules for the functioning of the Board. The entire procedure shall be kept flexible to adapt to changing situations. The Board shall
initiate, with the Owner’s and Contractor’s concurrence, new procedures or modifications to old ones whenever this is deemed appropriate.


C.	Recommend Resolution of Disputes

1.         Upon receipt by the Board of a written Request for Review of a Dispute, either from the Owner or the Contractor, the Board shall convene a hearing to review and consider the Dispute
and thereafter issue a written recommendation to the Owner and the Contractor.

facet of the case.
3.         The Board shall make every effort to reach a unanimous
recommendation. If this proves impossible, the dissenting member may prepare a minority report.
4.         The Board’s recommendation, together with explanations of its reasoning, shall be submitted as a written report to both parties. The recommendation shall be based on the pertinent
provisions of the Contract, applicable laws and regulations, and the facts and circumstances involved in the dispute. It is important for the Board to express, clearly and completely, the logic and reasoning leading to the recommendation so that
both parties fully understand it.
5.         The recommendation concerning any dispute is not
binding, unless agreed otherwise by the Owner and the Contractor.


D.	Other

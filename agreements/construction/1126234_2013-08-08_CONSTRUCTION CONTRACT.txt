8.1.1    The Design-Builder may request or the Owner, without invalidating this Agreement, may order changes in the Work within the general scope of the Contract Documents consisting of adjustment to the Contract Price or the Date of Substantial Completion or the Date of Final Completion.

8.2.3    If the Owner and the Design-Builder agree upon the adjustments in the Contract Price or the Date of Substantial Completion or the Date of Final Completion, and if appropriate the compensation for Design services, for a change in the Work directed by an Interim Directed Change, such agreement shall be the subject of an appropriate Change Order. The Change Order shall include all outstanding Change Directives issued since the last Change Order.

8.3
MINOR CHANGES IN THE WORK


8.3.1    Design-Builder may make minor changes in the design and construction of the Project consistent with the intent of the Contract Documents which do not involve an adjustment in the Contract Price or the Date of Substantial Completion or the Date of Final Completion; and do not materially and adversely affect the design of the Project, the quality of any of the materials or equipment specified in the Contract Documents, the performance of any materials, equipment or systems specified in the Contract Documents, or the quality of workmanship required by the Contract Documents.
8.3.2    Design-Builder shall promptly inform the Owner in writing of any such changes and shall record such changes on the Design-Build Documents maintained by the Design-Builder.

8.4
DETERMINATION OF COST


8.4.1    An increase or decrease in the Contract Price resulting from a change in the Work shall be determined by one or more of the following methods:
8.4.1.1    unit prices set forth in this Agreement or as subsequently agreed;

8.4.1.2
a mutually accepted, itemized lump sum; or


8.4.1.3    if an increase or decrease cannot be agreed to as set forth in Clause 8.4.1.1 or 8.4.1.2 and the Owner issues a written order for the Design-Builder to proceed with the change, the adjustment in the Contract Price shall be determined by the reasonable expense and savings of the performance of the Work resulting from the change. If there is a net increase in the Contract Price, a reasonable adjustment shall be made in the Design-Builder's overhead and profit. In the case of a net decrease in cost, the amount of decrease in the Contract Price will not include a reduction in overhead and profit. The Design-Builder shall maintain a documented, itemized accounting evidencing the expenses and savings.
8.4.2    If unit prices are indicated in the Contract Documents or are subsequently agreed to by the Parties, but the character or quantity of such unit items as originally contemplated is so different in a proposed Change Order that the original unit prices will cause substantial inequity to the Owner or the Design-Builder, such unit prices shall be equitably adjusted.
8.4.3    If the Owner and the Design-Builder disagree as to whether work required by the Owner is within the scope of the Work, the Design-Builder shall furnish the Owner with an estimate of the costs to perform the disputed work in accordance with the Owner's interpretations. If the Owner issues a written order for the Design-Builder to proceed, the Design-Builder shall perform the disputed work and the Owner shall pay the Design-Builder fifty percent (50%) of its estimated cost to perform the work. In such event, both Parties reserve their rights as to whether the work was within the scope of the Work. The Owner's payment does not prejudice its right to be reimbursed should it be determined that the disputed work was within the scope of Work. The Design-Builder's receipt of
payment for the disputed work does not prejudice its right to receive full payment for the disputed work should it be determined that the disputed work is not within the scope of the Work.

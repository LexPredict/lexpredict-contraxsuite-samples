Contractor shall be fully responsible to Owner for all acts
and omissions of Subcontractors and other personnel hired or
retained by Contractor to perform or furnish any of the Work
required by the Contract Documents. Contractor, however,
shall not be responsible for any acts or omissions of
personnel hired or retained by Owner in connection with the
Project. Nothing in the Contract Documents shall create for
the benefit of any personnel hired or retained by Owner any
contractual relationship with Contractor nor shall it create
any obligation on the part of Contractor to make payment to
personnel hired by or retained by Owner.

3.1.2.3   RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCHEDULING.

Contractor shall be responsible for scheduling and
coordinating Subcontractors and other personnel retained or
hired by Contractor to perform the Work or any portion

assume toward Contractor all the obligations and responsibilities
which Contractor assumes toward Owner. Each Subcontractor shall
preserve and protect the rights of Owner under the Contract Documents
with respect to the Work to be performed by such Subcontractor so that
subcontracting thereof will not prejudice any rights of Owner against
Contractor under the Contract Documents. Where appropriate, Contractor
may require each Subcontractor to enter into similar agreements with
Sub-subcontractors.

date set forth in the Contract Time Schedule, due to any reason other than a
delay described in paragraph 6.3, Contractor shall pay to Owner as liquidated
damages the total of the following sums:

1.        The first thirty (30) calendar days of delay, the sum of One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) per day;

2.        The second thirty (30) calendar days of delay, the sum of
Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) per day;

subsequent day of delay, the sum of Four Thousand Dollars
($4,000.00) per day.

Contractor and Owner agree that the payment of liquidated damages pursuant to
this paragraph 6.1 shall be in lieu of actual delay damages caused by the delay
in achieving Substantial Completion, that such payment is not intended as a
penalty or a forfeiture, and that the amount of such liquidated damages to be so
paid is reasonable in comparison to the approximate scope of actual delay
damages that the parties anticipate as of the time of execution of this
Agreement. Liquidated damages under this section shall not exceed Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000.00).

Page 16 of 41

<PAGE>

6.2       DATE OF SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION.

The date or dates for Substantial Completion of the Work or a designated portion
thereof are set forth in the Contract Time Schedule.

or omission of Owner or by any separate contractor employed by Owner; (2)
changes ordered in the Project; (3) labor disputes, fire, or unusual delay in
transportation; (4) adverse weather conditions not reasonably anticipatable; (5)
unavoidable casualties; (6) any act or omission of the federal, state, county,
or municipal government; (7) any shortages of equipment, materials, fuels, or
other supplies not due to the failure of Contractor timely to schedule and order
such equipment, materials, fuels, or other supplies; (8) any causes beyond
Contractor's reasonable control; or (9) a delay authorized by Owner, then
Contractor shall be entitled to a Change Order extending the date for
Substantial Completion and/or increasing the Contract Price for the period of
time and for such increase in the Costs of the Work as are caused by such delay.
If the Work is delayed due to the fault of Contractor, Contractor shall be
responsible for additional Costs of the Work directly resulting from such delay
and for the liquidated damages specified in paragraph 6.1, but shall not
otherwise be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
other damages which may be suffered or incurred by Owner or others resulting
from any interruption or delay in start-up or use of, or production from, any of
Owner's existing facilities or those to be designed and constructed hereunder.
Contractor shall keep such records as shall substantiate the events described in
this paragraph 6.3. Contractor shall give Owner written contemporaneous notice
of the occurrence of any events specified above that might reasonably be
expected to cause an actual delay in Substantial Completion of the Work.

6.4       EARLY OCCUPANCY.

Owner may occupy or use any completed or partially completed portion of the
Project at any stage when such portion is designated by separate agreement with
Contractor and Owner, provided such occupancy or use is consented to by the
insurer required under paragraph 11.6.4 and authorized by public authorities
having jurisdiction over the Work. In the event Owner elects to enter into use
or occupancy of a portion or portions of the Project prior to Substantial
Completion, Owner and Contractor shall make a joint inspection prior to such use
or occupancy of the portion or portions to be used or occupied and prepare and
sign a list with respect thereto of items of the Work remaining to be completed
or the Work to be replaced or repaired. Contractor shall thereafter have no
further responsibility for the care or maintenance of the portion of the Project
so used or occupied, and it shall be deemed accepted by Owner except with
respect to the Work remaining to be completed or necessary repair or replacement
of the Work as indicated on said list. The construction warranty period referred
to in paragraph 3.3 with respect to the Work accepted in accord with this
paragraph shall be deemed to begin on the date of such acceptance.

6.5       ACCEPTANCE OF WORK.

interests will have access to construction at the Site at reasonable times for
their observation, inspection, and testing. Contractor shall provide them proper
access to the Site and advise them of Contractor's Site safety procedures so
that they comply therewith.

9.2       UNCOVERING OF WORK.

If a portion of the Work is covered contrary to Owner's written request, it
must, if required by Owner, be uncovered for Owner's observation and be replaced
at the expense of Contractor without change in the time for Substantial
Completion. If a portion of the Work has been covered which Owner has not
specifically requested to observe prior to its being covered, Owner may request
to see such Work and it shall be uncovered by Contractor. If such Work is in
accord with the Contract Documents, the costs of uncovering and replacement
shall, by appropriate Change Order, be charged to Owner. If such Work is

Page 22 of 41

<PAGE>

not in accord with the Contract Documents, Contractor shall pay such costs
unless the condition was caused by Owner, its employees, consultants, or agents.

9.3       CORRECTION OF WORK.

9.3.1     WORK REJECTED BY OWNER.

Contractor shall promptly correct Work rejected by Owner which fails
to conform to the requirements of the Contract Documents, whether
observed before or after Substantial Completion and whether or not
fabricated, installed, or completed. Contractor shall bear the costs
of correcting such non-conforming Work.

9.3.2     AFTER FINAL COMPLETION.

If, within one (1) year after the date of Substantial Completion of
the Work or a designated portion thereof, or any longer period
prescribed by any special guarantee required by the Contract
Documents, any of the Work is found to be not in accord with the
requirements of the Contract Documents, Contractor, at no expense to
Owner, shall cause the Work to be corrected promptly after receipt of
written notice from Owner to do so unless Owner has previously given
Contractor a written acceptance of such condition. This obligation
under this paragraph shall survive acceptance of and payment for the
Work under this Agreement. The obligation under this paragraph shall
also survive termination of this Agreement for cause. Owner shall give
such notice promptly after discovery of the condition.

9.3.3     REMOVAL OF WORK.

Contractor shall remove from the Site portions of the Work which are
not in accord with the requirement of the Contract Documents and are
neither corrected by Contractor nor accepted by Owner.

9.3.4     FAILURE TO CORRECT NON-CONFORMING WORK.

If Contractor fails to correct non-conforming Work within a reasonable
time, Owner may correct it in accord with paragraph 12.2.1. If the
Contract Price has already been paid in full, Contractor shall pay to
Owner upon demand the actual and reasonable costs of correcting such
non-conforming Work upon receipt of a reasonably itemized invoice for
such correction. If Contractor shall not pay the invoice sum to Owner
within fifteen (15) days of receipt, interest shall accrue on the
amount due from the overdue date to the date actually paid and
received by Owner at the annual rate of eighteen percent (18%) or one
and a half percent (1.5%) per month.

9.4       ACCEPTANCE OF NONCONFORMING WORK.

If Owner prefers to accept Work which is not in accord with the requirements of
the Contract Documents, Owner may do so instead of requiring its removal and
correction, in which case the Contract Price will be adjusted as appropriate and
equitable. Such adjustment shall be effected whether or not Final Payment has
been made.

dumpsters, and miscellaneous costs;

Ten percent (10%) retainage on all construction management
and construction costs until fifty percent (50%) of the Work
is complete and five percent (5%) retainage thereafter; and

Ninety percent (90%) of retainage previously withheld to be
paid upon Substantial Completion of the Project; provided,
however if the estimated cost of completing punchwork items
exceeds ten percent (10%) of withheld retainage, then the
amount of retainage to be paid upon Substantial Completion
shall be reduced so that the amount of retainage withheld
equals 125% of the cost of completing punchwork items, which
portion of the retainage withheld for punchwork items shall
not be paid

Page 24 of 41

<PAGE>

to Contractor until Contractor has completed all punchwork
items to Owner's reasonable satisfaction.

If payment is requested on the basis of materials and equipment not
incorporated in the Work but delivered and suitably stored at the Site
or at another location agreed to in writing, the Application for
Payment shall also be accompanied by a bill of sale, invoice, or other
documentation warranting that Owner has received the materials and
equipment free and clear of all liens and evidence that the materials
and equipment are covered by appropriate property insurance and other
arrangements to protect Owner's interest therein.

10.2.2    PAYMENT BY OWNER.

No later than the twenty-fifth (25th) day of each month after Owner's

of a dispute between Owner and Contractor with respect to amounts
owing under an Application for Payment, Owner shall pay to Contractor
all undisputed amounts of the Application for Payment.

10.2.3    FAILURE TO MAKE PAYMENT.

If Owner should fail to pay Contractor at the time the payment of any
undisputed amount becomes due, Contractor may, at its option, upon
giving written notice that it will stop Work within ten (10) days
after receipt of the notice by Owner, and after such ten (10) day
period, stop the Work until payment of the undisputed amount owing has
been received. Owner, however, shall have the right to credit against
payments due Contractor amounts due Owner from Contractor for
liquidated damages, and in such event Contractor shall not have the
right to stop Work.

10.2.4    INTEREST.

Payments due but unpaid more than five (5) days after their due date
shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to eighteen percent (18%)
until paid or one and a half percent (1.5%) per month.

free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests, or encumbrances
(hereinafter referred to as "Liens"). Contractor further warrants that upon
submittal of an Application for Payment, all Work for which an Application for
Payment has been previously issued and payments received from Owner shall be
free and clear of liens, claims, security interests, or encumbrances in favor of
Contractor, Subcontractors, material suppliers, or other persons or entities
making a claim by reason of having provided labor, materials, and equipment
relating to the Work.

to retainage as set forth in paragraph 10.2.1 pending completion of all
punchwork items) shall be due and payable when the Work is delivered to Owner,
ready for beneficial occupancy, or when Owner occupies the Work, whichever event
first occurs, provided that the Work be then substantially completed and this
Agreement substantially performed and an unconditional certificate of occupancy
or compliance has been issued. If there should remain minor items to be
completed, Contractor and Owner shall list such items, and Contractor shall
deliver, in writing, its guarantee to complete said items within sixty (60) days
thereafter.

Page 25 of 41

Owner may retain from retainage a sum equal to 125% of the estimated cost of
completing any unfinished items, provided that said unfinished items are listed
separately and the estimated cost of completing any unfinished items is likewise
listed separately. Thereafter, Owner shall pay to Contractor, monthly, the
amount retained for incomplete items as each of said items is completed to
Owner's reasonable satisfaction.

after receipt of Final Payment from Owner upon receipt of final executed lien
waivers from all such suppliers and Subcontractors.

Contractor and to which the insurance company or companies providing
the property insurance have consented by endorsement to any applicable
policy or otherwise. Consent of Contractor and of the insurance
company or companies to such occupancy or use shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Owner shall take no action with respect to
partial occupancy or use that would cause cancellation, lapse, or
reduction of applicable insurance.

11.6.5    BOILER AND MACHINERY INSURANCE.

Owner (or Contractor upon written request of Owner and on Owner's
behalf and at Owner's expense) shall purchase and maintain such boiler
and machinery insurance as may be required or necessary. This
insurance shall include the interests of Owner, Contractor, and
Subcontractors in the Work and Owner and Contractor shall be named
insureds under such insurance.

11.6.6    LOSS OF USE OF PROPERTY.

Owner (or Contractor upon written request of Owner and on Owner's
behalf and at Owner's expense) shall purchase and maintain such
insurance as will protect Owner and Contractor against loss of use of
Owner's property due to those perils insured pursuant to paragraph
11.6.1. Such policy will provide coverage for expenses of expediting
materials, continuing overhead of Owner and Contractor, necessary
labor expense including overtime, loss of income by Owner, and other
determined exposures. Exposures of Owner and Contractor shall be
determined by mutual agreement and separate limits of coverage fixed
for each item. Owner and its insurers waive all rights of actions
against Contractor for loss of use of Owner's property including
consequential losses due to the perils insured pursuant to paragraph
11.6.1. Contractor agrees that it shall properly secure equipment and
materials on the Site to protect the equipment and materials from
theft or other loss not due to casualty. Contractor acknowledges that
Owner's insurance with respect to loss of equipment and materials will
contain a deductible payable by Owner until certain limits of loss are
reached. If the experience of loss of equipment and materials exceeds
that which Owner's insurer believes customary for a project of the
size and complexity of the Project, Owner shall so inform Contractor
in writing. Promptly thereafter, Owner and Contractor shall meet to
discuss additional security actions to be taken by Contractor at no
cost to Owner to prevent further loss of equipment and materials,
which additional steps Contractor shall implement promptly.

11.6.7    ADDITIONAL INSUREDS.

Contractor and its Subcontractors shall be named as additional
insureds under all of the policies of insurance required by this
paragraph 11.6.

11.7      OWNER'S POLICIES - CERTIFICATE OF INSURANCE.

Owner shall furnish Contractor a Certificate of Insurance as to all policies
provided by Owner pursuant to this Agreement promptly following execution of
this Agreement but in no event later than the day when an exposure to loss may
occur. Contractor will be given thirty (30) days notice of cancellation,
non-renewal, or any endorsements restricting or reducing coverage. If Owner does
not intend to purchase the insurance specified in paragraph 11.6 (or to have
Contractor purchase such insurance on Owner's behalf and at Owner's expense), it
shall inform Contractor in writing prior to the commencement of the Work.
Contractor may then effect insurance which will protect the interest of
Contractor and the Subcontractors, and the Contract Price shall be increased by
Change Order. If Contractor is damaged by failure of Owner

Page 29 of 41

<PAGE>

to purchase or maintain such insurance or to so notify Contractor, Owner shall
bear all reasonable costs properly attributable thereto.

11.8      PROPERTY INSURANCE LOSS ADJUSTMENT

11.8.1    PAYMENT OF AN INSURED LOSS.

Any insured loss shall be adjusted with Owner and Contractor and made
payable to Owner and Contractor as trustees for the insureds, as their
interests may appear, subject to any applicable mortgage clause.

11.8.2    DISTRIBUTION OF MONIES.

Upon the occurrence of an insured loss, monies received will be
deposited in a separate account and the trustees shall make
distribution in accord with the agreement of the parties in interest.
In the absence of such agreement, any dispute between the parties as
to the distribution of the monies received shall be determined in
accord with the provisions of Article 13.

11.9      WAIVER OF RIGHTS.

11.9.1    WAIVER FOR PERILS COVERED BY INSURANCE.

Owner and Contractor and their insurers waive all rights against each
other and Subcontractors for damages caused by perils covered by
insurance provided under paragraph 11.6, except such rights as they
may have to the proceeds of such insurance held by Owner and
Contractor as trustees. Contractor shall require similar waivers from
all Subcontractors and their insurers in favor of Owner and
Contractor.

11.9.2    WAIVER FOR DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT.

Owner and Contractor and their insurers waive all rights against each
other and Subcontractors for loss or damage to any equipment used in
connection with the Project which loss is covered by any property
insurance. Contractor shall require similar waivers from all
Subcontractors and their insurers in favor of Owner and Contractor.

11.9.3    WAIVER OF SUBROGATION BY CONTRACTOR'S INSURERS.

Contractor shall obtain a waiver of subrogation consistent with this
paragraph 11.9 by endorsement or otherwise from any insurer who issues
any policy of insurance required of Contractor pursuant to the
provisions of paragraph 11.6 above. Provided, however, Contractor
shall not be required to obtain a waiver of subrogation under its
professional liability policy required by paragraph 11.2.8 above.
Contractor will obtain similar waivers of rights and waivers of
subrogation interests from its Subcontractors and their insurers in
favor of Contractor and Owner.

11.9.4    WAIVER OF SUBROGATION BY OWNER'S INSURERS.

Owner shall obtain a waiver of subrogation consistent with this
paragraph 11.9 by endorsement or otherwise, from any insurer who
issues any policy of insurance required to be obtained by Owner
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 11.6 above. Owner will obtain
a waiver of subrogation in favor of Contractor and Subcontractors on
property and consequential loss policies purchased for the Project
after its completion. Owner will obtain similar waivers of rights and
waivers of subrogation interests from its separate contractors or
consultants and their insurers in favor of Contractor and
Subcontractors.

11.9.5    EFFECT OF ENDORSEMENTS.

If the policies of insurance referred to in this Article 11 require an
endorsement to provide for continued coverage where there is a waiver
of subrogation, Owner and Contractor will cause them to be endorsed.

directors, officers, employees, agents or Subcontractor(s) (the
"Contractor Indemnified Parties") against all liabilities, claims and
demands from losses, property damage, and bodily injury (including
death) (including reasonable and actual attorneys' fees and related
costs and expenses) arising out of the actual, potential, or suspected
presence of Hazardous Materials as defined in paragraph 11.10.3 of

officers, employees, agents, or Subcontractor(s) from any and all
liability, claims, or demands from losses due to the release or threat
of release, or any disposal or treatment or transport of Hazardous
Materials not created, stored, released, transported, or generated by
the Contractor Indemnified Parties. All such liability shall rest
solely with Owner and/or the generator(s) of the Hazardous Materials,
the property owner(s), and/or their selected contractor(s) for
treatment, transport and/or disposal, as appropriate. Conversely,
Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Owner, its
directors, officers, employees, agents, or Subcontractor(s) (the
"Owner Indemnified Parties") against all liabilities, claims, and
demands from losses, property damage, and bodily injury (including

Contractor to undertake for Owner's benefit potentially uninsurable
obligations involving the presence or potential presence of
environmental hazards. Owner acknowledges that services rendered by
Contractor under this Agreement may or will involve or be affected by
Hazardous Materials. Owner agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Indemnified Parties from any and all liabilities, losses
and damages of any nature, including reasonable and actual attorneys'
fees and related costs and expenses, arising out of any and all claims
of any nature made against Contractor which relate in any way to both:

a.        Hazardous Materials or pollution or contamination due to the
presence of Hazardous Materials, including their
transportation or release from Owner's property but not
created, stored, released, transported, or generated by the
Contractor Indemnified Parties; and

b.        The performance by Contractor of its obligations under this
Agreement, whether or not such performance by Contractor is
claimed to have been, was or may have been negligent,
grossly negligent, reckless, or intentional, provided,
however, Owner shall not be liable to Contractor for any
liabilities, losses, or damages of any nature that could
have reasonably been avoided by Contractor in the exercise
of ordinary care.

15.3      ELECTRONIC MEDIA.

15.3.1    FORMAT.

Electronic media, including magnetic and optical disks and magnetic
tapes, submitted by Contractor to Owner under this Agreement are
intended to operate on a system of hardware and software identical to
that utilized by Contractor to produce such media. Contractor makes no
warranty or representation as to the capability of such media to

15.3.5    COMPUTER VIRUSES.

Neither party shall be responsible to the other for the effects of
computer viruses transmitted through the exchange of electronic media,
but each party shall maintain appropriate virus detection programs.

15.4      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

15.4.1    ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES.

Contractor states and Owner acknowledges that Contractor does not
specialize in and has not been trained in the discovery, abatement,
handling, removal, packaging, transport, or disposal of hazardous,
toxic, and/or radiologic waste or substances in any form which may be
present at the Site excluding any such substances used by Contractor
or Subcontractors in performing the Work. Any services necessary in
connection with such hazardous substances and/or waste shall be
contracted for by Owner directly with consultants, and properly
licensed contractors, transporters, treatment, storage, and disposal
facilities specializing in hazardous, toxic, and/or radiologic waste
and/or substances encountered during the performance of this
Agreement.

15.4.2    ASBESTOS OR PCB.

In the event Contractor encounters on the Site material(s) suspected
or reasonably believed to be hazardous, toxic, and/or radiologic waste
and/or substances, including asbestos or polychlorinated biphenyl
(PCB) materials which were not known at the time of this Agreement and
have not been rendered safe relative to accomplishing the Work but
excluding any such substances used by Contractor or Subcontractors in
performing the Work, Contractor shall immediately stop the Work in the
area affected and report the condition to Owner in writing. The Work
in the affected area shall be resumed when documentation reasonably
satisfactory to Contractor assures the absence or proper control or
management of hazardous, toxic, and/or radiologic waste and/or
substances, or when it has been investigated and determined to be
safe, remediated, or abated as approved by the regulatory agency(ies)
having jurisdiction. Should the investigations, remedies, regulatory
agency approval, or other activities related to releasing the affected
Work area back to Contractor delay or otherwise affect the Work,
Contractor shall be compensated for its costs and delays in accordance
with paragraph 6.3.

15.4.3    WORK WITH HAZARDOUS, TOXIC, AND RADIOLOGIC WASTE AND
SUBSTANCES.

Contractor shall not be required to perform any Work without its
consent relating to hazardous, toxic, and/or radiologic waste and/or
substances, including asbestos or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) but
excluding any such substances used by Contractor or Subcontractors in
performing the Work.

15.4.4    CESSATION OF WORK.

If reasonable precautions will be inadequate to prevent or mitigate
known or foreseeable impacts to human health and the environment,
bodily injury, or death to persons resulting from a material or
substance encountered on the Site by Contractor, Contractor shall,
upon recognizing or suspecting the condition, immediately stop the
Work in the affected area and report the condition to Owner in
writing. Contractor shall have no responsibility for searching for or
identifying any hazardous or toxic materials, wastes or substances,
pollution, or contamination due to the presence of hazardous or toxic
materials, wastes, or substances. In the event that Contractor
discovers or suspects the presence of any such materials, wastes,
substances, pollution, or contamination, Contractor may at its sole
discretion stop work and, if Owner and Contractor cannot jointly
establish criteria and compensation, if any, for the resumption of the
Work, terminate this Agreement. In event of Work stoppage, Owner and
Contractor shall jointly establish criteria and compensation, if any,
for the resumption of the Work. In the event of

Page 36 of 41

<PAGE>

termination, Contractor, its directors, officers, employees, agents,
or Subcontractor(s) shall have no further liability to Owner for
performance under this Agreement, and Owner shall make the payments to
Contractor required in paragraph 12.1.

15.4.5    SITE RESPONSIBILITY.

Because Contractor is constructing the Work on sites owned or
controlled by others, Contractor does not, nor shall it, assume
responsibility or liability for any on-going or past on-site or
off-site activities, nor the reporting of any conditions at the Site,
that may present a potential danger to public health, safety, or the
environment according to regulations of any federal, state or local
government agency provided such activities or conditions are not
created by Contractor or Subcontractors. Owner, generator, property
owner, and/or operator shall be solely responsible for compliance with
proper notification, record keeping, reporting, storage, handling,
manifesting, transport, disposal, and all other regulatory
requirements for regulated and hazardous materials, waste, or
substances existing on the Site other than hazardous materials,
wastes, or substances used by Contractor or Subcontractors in
performing the Work.

15.4.6    UNKNOWN CONDITIONS.

Owner recognizes that when hazardous waste and/or substances are
known, assumed, or suspected to exist on or beneath the surface of the
Site, statutes and standard practices require the handling of certain
materials as contaminated waste and/or substances. Owner waives any
and all claims against Contractor, its directors, officers, employees,
agents, or Subcontractor(s) and holds them harmless from any and all
claims or liability for injury or loss which may arise as a result of
the hazardous waste and/or substances remaining on the Site. Owner
also agrees to compensate Contractor for any time spent and expenses
incurred by Contractor or its Subcontractor(s) in defense of any such
claim. Owner assumes all responsibility for all activities associated
with such waste.

15.4.7    SUBSURFACE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES.

As knowledge of subsurface conditions is limited to the interpretation
of discreet data derived from specific investigation points and such
conditions may change over time, unknown conditions may be encountered
during subsurface construction activities. These construction
activities may contribute to unavoidable impacts or contamination of
certain subsurface strata or area(s), as when excavation, pile
driving, caisson boring, auger, drill bit, or other constructed Work
or equipment moves through an impacted or contaminated zone or area,
linking the impacted or contaminated zone or area to an unimpacted or
uncontaminated zone, area, aquifer, underground stream, or other
hydrous body not previously impacted or contaminated and capable of
spreading constituents to other areas both on-site and off-site.
Therefore, since the nature of subsurface conditions is not fully
known, the elimination of the risk or potential risk of
cross-contamination is not possible. Owner waives any and all claims
against Contractor or its Subcontractor(s) and agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold Contractor, its directors, officers, employees,
agents, and/or Subcontractor(s) harmless from any and all claim or
liability for injury or loss which may arise as a result of an alleged
cross-contamination caused by installation of the Work that could not
be avoided with the exercise of reasonable diligence. Owner further
agrees to compensate Contractor or its Subcontractor(s) in defense of
any such claim.

15.4.8    HEALTH & SAFETY PRECAUTIONS.

When hazardous substances, waste, or materials are known, assumed, or
suspected to exist at a site, Contractor and its Subcontractor(s) are
required to take appropriate precautions to protect the health and
safety of personnel, to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
and to follow procedures that are deemed prudent to minimize physical
and health risks to employees, the public, and the environment. Owner
hereby warrants that if it knows or has any reason to assume or
suspect that hazardous, toxic or radiologic substances, waste, or
materials may exist at the Site or adjacent thereto it has so informed
Contractor.

Page 37 of 41

<PAGE>

15.4.9    LABORATORY VERIFICATION.

Owner shall be responsible for obtaining the services of a qualified,
licensed laboratory to verify the presence or absence of hazardous,
toxic, or radiologic substances, waste, or materials reported by
Contractor. In the event such substances, waste, or material is found
to be present, Owner shall notify appropriate regulatory agencies
and/or verify that it has been rendered safe relative to accomplishing
the Work. Unless otherwise required by the Contract Documents, Owner
shall furnish in writing to Contractor the names and qualifications of
persons or entities who are to perform investigations and tests
verifying the presence or absence of such hazardous, toxic, or
radiologic substances, waste, or materials or the names and
qualifications of properly licensed contractors, transporters,
treatment, storage, and disposal facilities specializing in hazardous,
toxic, and/or radiologic waste and/or substances encountered during
the execution of the Work. who are to perform the tasks of removal or
safe containment of such hazardous, toxic, or radiologic substances,
waste, or materials. Contractor will promptly reply to Owner in
writing stating whether it has a reasonable objection to persons or
entities proposed by Owner. If Contractor has an objection to a person
or entities proposed by Owner, Owner shall propose another to whom
Contractor has no reasonable objection.

15.5      EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES AND DAMAGES.

Contractor makes no warranty or guarantee of any kind in connection with
performance of the Work under this Agreement other than those expressly provided
under this Agreement. ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE EXCLUDED. IN NO
EVENT SHALL CONTRACTOR'S LIABILITY TO OWNER ARISING OUT OF CONTRACTOR'S BREACH
OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, FOR ANY REASON, EXCEED THE CONTRACT
PRICE PLUS ANY ASSESSED LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED
TWO MILLION DOLLARS ($2,000,000.00). UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL CONTRACTOR BE
LIABLE TO OWNER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, COLLATERAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE.

15.6      WAIVER.

The failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement
at any time, or from time to time, shall not operate as a waiver with respect to
future actions.

15.7      EFFECT OF AGREEMENT.

The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and

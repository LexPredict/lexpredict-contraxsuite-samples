A
G R E E M E N T S:


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
premises herein contained and for Ten and No/100 ($10.00) Dollars and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned agree as follows:


1.          The
Loan. Lender shall make a loan (the “Loan”) to Borrower in the principal amount
of SIX
MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND NO/100 ($6,715,000.00) DOLLARS
to pay for the costs of labor performed and materials furnished (collectively
called the “Work”, including the Landlord’s Work and the Tenant’s Work)
pursuant to the Lease, to be advanced by Lender as provided below. Borrower
agrees that Borrower will fully perform Borrower’s covenants and obligations
under the Contract and the Construction Agreement executed by Borrower with
respect to Landlord’s Work. Borrower will enforce the performance by Tenant
under the Lease, including Tenant’s covenants and obligations under the Work
Letter with respect to Tenant’s Work. Borrower agrees that the Improvements
will be completed by the Completion Date.


2.          Warranties.
Borrower warrants and represents that as of the date hereof, no Work of any
kind has been performed upon the Property, no material or equipment has been
delivered upon the Property, and no construction contract has been executed by
Borrower for any work or materials in connection with any of the Improvements
contemplated to be constructed on the Property. Furthermore, Borrower confirms,
ratifies and reiterates each and every warranty and representation contained in
the Mortgage and each instrument executed by Borrower in connection with the
Loan.

3.          Loan
Advances; Retainage. The proceeds of the Loan relating to the Work shall be
advanced from time to time (at such intervals as Lender shall determine) in
installments, in amounts and after Borrower has requested Lender, as provided
in this Agreement, to pay for Work which has been performed and completed under
the Contract and after Lender is satisfied that the Work, or such portion of
the Work satisfactory to Lender, has been completed in accordance with the
Plans and Specifications and the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the
Contract and the Construction Agreement and such work has been approved by
Lender’s third party inspector (such as AECC). In no event shall the total
advances exceed the amount of the Note, unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by both of the undersigned or contemplated in this Agreement. The Lender shall
not have an obligation to make any advance under the Note if there is a default
under the Note, the Contract, this Agreement, the Construction Agreement or any
other instrument executed in connection with the Loan.


The amount
of each advance shall be the amount approved by Lender, in its sole discretion,
less ten percent (10%) (the “Retainage”) unless such Retainage is waived
by Borrower and Lender. To the extent Retainage may be waived, Borrower
acknowledges that Borrower may be additionally and personally liable to
Contractors, including subcontractors or material suppliers and other lien
claimants, for such amount under applicable law, but Lender shall have no
liability therefor. Borrower understands that such liability would be in
addition to all amounts Borrower will have paid Contractor, and in some
instances could make Borrower pay more than 100% of the Contract Price.


Within ten
(10) days following Lender’s written demand to Borrower, Borrower shall deposit
with Lender such sums (the “Borrower’s Deposit”) as Lender may deem
necessary in addition to the Loan for the completion and payment of all costs
in connection with the construction of the Improvements and for the performance
of any obligation of Borrower to Lender. Borrower agrees that such Borrower’s
Deposit will be advanced by Lender for the Work prior to Lender’s advancing
additional funds out of the Loan.


4.          Conditions
for Initial Advance. In addition to the requirements contained in other
Sections of this Agreement, prior to or at the time of the initial advance on
the Loan (including the purchase money portion of the Loan), Lender shall be in

This
Agreement.






















(c)

(g)


Proof
satisfactory to Lender that Borrower has paid third party Contractor(s) the
first $0.00 of the cost of the Work.






















(h)


Such other
documents as Lender may reasonably require in connection with the Loan.




Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, upon the closing of the
Loan (i.e., Lender receipt and approval of items a, b and c above), Lender
shall advance to Borrower the amount of Borrower’s closing costs, one half
(1/2) of the commission and soft costs as per the Budget which Borrower has
provided to Lender. Following that, the next series of advances on the Loan
shall be with respect to the Landlord’s Work as provided in this Agreement.
Following substantial completion of Landlord’s Work, then the next series of
advances shall be with respect to the Tenant’s Work as provided in this
Agreement.


5.          Application
for Advances. An application for each advance, in form approved by Lender,
shall be filed a reasonable time before the date upon which an advance is
desired, certified to by: (i) Borrower’s architect, engineer or inspector, if
any, as approved by Lender; (ii) such inspector or engineer as required by
Lender, in its discretion; (iii) Borrower; and (iv) with respect to any of
Tenant’s Work, approved by Tenant in accordance with the Work Letter. Such
application shall contain such information as Lender may reasonably request,
including proof of payment to Contractor, including all contractors,
subcontractors, materialmen, laborers, vendors, suppliers and all others
providing labor and materials for the Improvements (in the case of
subcontractors, with respect to amounts greater than $10,000.00). With respect
to lien waivers from Contractor, the same may be conditional based on payment of
current amounts due, and with respect to any final lien waiver shall be
submitted to Lender within ten (10) days following advancement therefor.
Following any event of default by Borrower and/or with the prior consent of
Borrower, amounts advanced under the Loan on behalf of Borrower may be
delivered directly to any Contractor, or in Lender’s discretion may be funded
by a check issued jointly to Borrower and any such Contractor. Lender shall
have the right to enter the Property and to inspect the Work at any time.
Additionally, Lender shall have the right to inspect all books and records of
Borrower relating to the Property and the Improvements. Lender shall have the
absolute right to communicate directly with any contractors, workmen, artisans,
materialmen, suppliers or subcontractors. Lender shall not be obligated to
advance for any Work not approved by Lender. Lender may, but is not obligated
to, exercise any of the rights of Borrower or Architect (as defined in the
Construction Agreement) in deciding to reduce or withhold all or any part of
any requested advance or payment.


4






6.          Change
Orders. No amendment, modification and/or change order (a “Change Order”)
to the Contract, the Plans and Specifications and/or the Construction
Agreement, shall be effective unless the same is in writing and signed by all
parties to such respective instrument. Furthermore, Lender shall have the right
to review and approve all Change Orders (i) in excess of $100,000, or (H) which
cumulatively affect the contract price by more than 5% of the contract price,
or (iii) which extend the contract time by 30 or more calendar days, or (iv)
which make any material change in the Plans and Specifications, as a condition
precedent to said Change Orders becoming effective. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Lender may, in Lender’s reasonable
discretion (but without any obligation of Lender to do so), choose to advance
additional sums under this Agreement for some or all of any Change Orders, or
for any other purpose, even to the extent that the total amount advanced is in
excess of the amount of the Note, which additional sums advanced shall be added
to the principal amount due under the Note and shall bear interest and shall be
due and payable as provided in the Note, or upon Lender’s request, Borrower
shall execute such additional Promissory Note to Lender and/or such
modification of Note as Lender shall request to evidence such indebtedness,
bearing interest and being due and payable as Lender shall require, all of
which shall be secured by the Liens, and Borrower shall execute such other and
further instruments as Lender’s counsel shall require.


7.          Commencement;
Completion; Payment of Retainage. Within ten (10) days following the
commencement of construction of the Improvements (which must be after the date

Affidavit of Completion in the form attached hereto as Attachment 2 and notice
thereof under Section 53.106 of the Texas Property Code; provided that the
Improvements have been inspected and accepted by Lender and by any financing
agency providing permanent financing of the Improvements. Additionally, the
Improvements shall not be considered complete unless and until all the Work
requiring inspection by any property owners association or similar entity, or
by any municipal or other governmental authority having jurisdiction, has been
duly inspected and approved by such entity or authority and all requisite
certificates of occupancy and other approvals have been duly issued; and
provided further, that Lender may withhold approval of final payment until
after evidence satisfactory to Lender shall have been presented to Lender
showing payment in full of all obligations incurred in connection with
construction and completion of the Improvements.


8.          Subrogation
for Advances. Advances made by Lender pursuant to this Agreement for Work
shall be in payment of such respective portion of the indebtedness from
Borrower to each Contractor for such Work, and Lender shall be subrogated to
any rights of each such respective Contractor with respect to such
indebtedness, including any and all rights, security interests and liens of
such respective Contractor, irrespective of whether such liens, security
interests, charges or encumbrances are released of record.


Borrower
shall have no right of offset, counterclaim or defense against Lender for
payment of any indebtedness owing under any Contract which Lender has advanced
under the Loan because of any claim Borrower may have against any such
Contractor. The obligations arising under any Contract and/or the Construction
Agreement between any Contractor and


5





Borrower are separate and independent of any obligations arising
hereunder among Borrower and Lender.


If
any portion of the indebtedness owing under any Contract or under any document
executed in connection with the Loan cannot lawfully be secured by the Liens
granted therein, any payment made on such indebtedness shall be applied first
to the discharge of such unsecured portion of the indebtedness.


9.          No
Liability of Lender. Lender has no liability, obligation or responsibility
whatsoever with respect to the Work related to the construction of the
Improvements except to advance the proceeds of the Loan as herein agreed.
Lender has no liability if the amount of the Loan is insufficient to complete
the Improvements. Lender is not obligated to inspect the Improvements or the
construction thereof nor is Lender liable for the performance or default of any
Contractor, including any contractor, subcontractor, materialman, supplier,
artisan or laborer, or for any failure to construct, complete, protect or
insure the Improvements, or for the payment of any cost or expense incurred in
connection therewith, or for the performance or nonperformance of any
obligation of Borrower to such parties; and nothing, including without
limitation, any disbursement hereunder or the deposit or acceptance of any document
or instrument, shall be construed as a representation or warranty, express or
implied, on Lender’s part. No party, including Borrower, any Contractor and/or
any third party, shall have the right to assert any claim against Lender as a
result of Lender’s inspections, failure to inspect, advances or otherwise. No
third party shall be entitled to be a beneficiary of this Agreement. Borrower
shall be responsible for inspecting the Improvements during construction and
for determining that the Improvements are in accordance with the Contract, the
Plans and Specifications and the Construction Agreement, and shall promptly
notify Lender in writing of any defects discovered by Borrower.


10.         Borrower’s
Additional Agreements. Borrower hereby agree as follows:


(a)      Borrower
agrees to save and hold Lender harmless from any and all claims of Contractor,
including any and all subcontractors, materialmen or laborers for work
performed, labor or supplies provided or for the construction of the Work.


(b)      All
amounts advanced by Lender in connection with the Work are stipulated as “Trust Funds”
for the benefit of those providing labor and materials until all such labor and
materials have been paid in full. Borrower shall fully and promptly pay all
Trust Funds promptly to the party entitled to payment thereof. In the event
Borrower should default in the payment of such Trust Funds (any amounts owing
as a result of such default being “Unpaid Bills”), then Lender may elect to
declare the Loan in default, or Lender may choose to allow further construction
of the Improvements (but without waiving such default or the right to later
declare any then uncured failure to pay Trust Funds as a default under this
Agreement), in which case the following shall apply:






















1)


Borrower shall continue to be fully responsible for all obligations
under the Agreement, the Contract, the Construction Agreement and all other




6
































instruments
executed in connection with the Loan and in connection with the Contract.






















2)


Advances may be made by Lender directly to any Contractor for
completed Work or for completion of the Work. Lender may choose not to pay to
or advance any further proceeds of the Loan directly to Borrower until all
Unpaid Bills have been paid and satisfied in full.






















3)


Upon completion of the Work, any unadvanced portion of the Loan may
be advanced by Lender to pay any then Unpaid Bills.






















4)


Lender is not waiving its right to declare this Agreement to be in
default as a result of a default as described above. In the event Lender
shall receive any lien claim or notice from any Contractor with respect to
Unpaid Bills, Lender shall have the right to exercise all rights under the
Note and this Agreement, including the termination by Lender of Lender’s
obligation to make further advances under the Loan, however any such
termination shall not effect or diminish Lender’s lien with respect to the
Property for all amounts advanced by Lender pursuant to the Contract and/or
this Agreement.




11.          Assignment.
Borrower hereby assigns to Lender any and all contracts, agreements and warranties with any Contractor of said party, and all professional
agreements, including those with architects, engineers and surveyors, and all
plans and specifications relating to the Improvements.


12.          Conformance
with Contract and Laws. Borrower hereby warrants to Lender that the
Improvements, when complete, and all work in progress, will be in strict
conformance with the Plans and Specifications, the Contract and the
Construction Agreement and all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, laws,
covenants and restrictions which may affect the Property or the Improvements.
This warranty to Lender shall survive termination, and shall remain in
existence until all indebtedness to Lender shall have been fully and finally
paid in full, and until all liens assigned to Lender have been fully and
finally released by Lender, notwithstanding the provisions of §16.009 of the
Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code. This warranty is assignable by Lender.


13.          Survey.
Upon request, the Borrower shall furnish to Lender, promptly after the
foundation for the Improvements has been poured, a survey by a surveyor,
licensed as such in the State of Texas and acceptable to Lender, of the
Property showing, in addition to the usual and customary information disclosed
by a proper survey, the location of said foundation, duly certified by such
surveyor as an accurate survey. Such survey must reflect that none of said Work
encroaches upon a street or any adjoining property and that no adjoining
structure encroaches upon said Property, and said survey must not disclose any
violation of building setback lines or building restrictions or any other title
defect or encumbrance. A final survey covering the matters set forth above
shall be of said Work in accordance with the Plans and Specifications therefor.
Lender may also require Borrower to furnish an “as built” set of plans and/or
specifications.


7






14.          Lender’s
Right to Complete. Subject to the force majeure provision in the next
paragraph, if Borrower at any time prior to the completion of the Improvements
abandons the same, ceases work thereon for a period of more than twenty (20)
days, fails to complete the erection of the Improvements strictly in accordance
with the Plans and Specifications, except as to changes approved by Lender,
makes material changes in the Plans and Specifications without first securing
written approval of the Lender in accordance with Section 6 of this Agreement,
fails to enforce any default by Tenant under the Lease, or otherwise fails to
comply with the terms of this Agreement or the Mortgage, any such failure shall
be a default hereunder and Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to complete the Improvements and the Liens granted under the Mortgage shall
secure all amounts incurred by Lender in connection with such completion. Such
amounts, together with an overhead and oversight fee of fifteen percent (15%)
thereof, shall be due and owing from Borrower to Lender and (together with
other amounts owing to Lender under the Loan and this Agreement) shall be fully
secured by the Liens. In the event of Borrower’s default, Lender may terminate
this Agreement, and/or the Lender, at its option, at any time thereafter, may
enter into possession of the Property and perform any and all work and labor
necessary to complete the Improvements; all sums so expended by the Lender,
together with an overhead and oversight fee of fifteen percent (15%) thereof,
shall be deemed advanced to Borrower and secured by the Mortgage.


Force
Majeure. Regarding the dates for completion of the Improvements and/or the
cessation of work for more than twenty (20) days as provided above in this
Agreement, if such date is prevented or delayed by reason of any act of Nature
(including, but not limited to lightning, storm, flood, hurricane), strike,
fire, explosion, lockout, labor trouble, acts of war or terrorism or inability
to secure materials, or any other cause (except financial inability) not the
fault of the party required to perform the act, and provided that such delay
qualifies as a force majeure event under the Lease with Tenant’s and Borrower’s
written acknowledgment thereof, Lender will not unreasonably withhold its
consent to Borrower’s request to extend the time for performance of the act for
a period equivalent to the number of days of delay and performance of the act
during the period of delay will be excused. However with respect to the date of
completion of the Improvements, such time of extension must be incorporated
into a written Modification Agreement executed by Borrower and Lender. Nothing
in this paragraph shall excuse the prompt payment of interest, principal or any
other amount required to be paid by Borrower to Lender under the Note or Loan
documents.


If Lender
takes possession of the Property, it may take any and all actions necessary in
Lender’s judgment to complete construction of the Improvements, including but
not limited to making changes in the Plans and Specifications (subject to the
provisions of the Lease), work, or materials and entering into, modifying or
terminating any contractual arrangements, subject to Lender’s right at any time
to discontinue any work without liability. If Lender elects to complete the
Improvements, it will not assume any liability to Borrower, Tenant or to any
other person for completing the Improvements or for the manner or quality of
construction of the Improvements, and Borrower expressly waives any such
liability. Borrower irrevocably appoints Lender as Borrower’s attorney-in-fact,
with full power of substitution, to complete the Improvements, at Lender’s
option, either in Borrower’s name or in Lender’s name. Lender shall have the
right, in its sole discretion, to: (a) use any funds of the Borrower, including
any balance which may be held in escrow and any funds which may remain
unadvanced under this Agreement for the


8





purpose of completing the Improvements, (b) employ such contractors,
subcontractors, and agents, architects and inspectors as shall be required for
said purposes, (c) employ watchmen to protect the Property from injury, (d)
pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which may be liens or
claims against the Improvements, or as may be necessary or desirable for the
completion of the Improvements, or for clearance of title, (e) execute all
applications and certificates in the name of the Borrower which may be required
by any of the contract documents relating to the Property and/or the
Improvements, and (f) to do any and every act which the Borrower might do in
its own behalf with respect to the Property and the Improvements It is further
understood and agreed that this power of attorney shall be deemed to be a power
coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. The above mentioned
attorney-in-fact shall also have the power to prosecute and defend all actions
or proceedings in connection with the construction of the Improvements or the
Property and to take such action and require such performance as such
attorney-in-fact deems necessary.


In any
event, all sums expended by Lender in completing the construction of the
Improvements will be considered to have been disbursed to Borrower and will be
secured by the collateral for the Loan. Any such sums that cause the principal
amount of the Loan to exceed the face amount of the Note will be considered to
be an additional Loan to Borrower, bearing interest as provided in the Note,
and being secured by Lender’s Liens on the Property and by all collateral for
the Loan.


For these
purposes, Borrower assigns to Lender all of its right, title and interest in
and to the following documents (the “Project Documents”): All Plans and
Specifications, all studies, data and drawings relating to the Property and the
Improvements, whether prepared by or for Borrower, all permits, all
construction contracts, all engineering and architectural contracts, and all
other contracts and agreements relating to the Property or to the construction
of the Improvements. However Lender will not have any obligation under the
Project Documents unless Lender expressly hereafter agrees to assume such
obligations in writing. Lender will have the right to exercise any rights of
Borrower under the Project Documents upon the occurrence of a default by
Borrower. Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender’s rights
and remedies, whether evidenced by this Agreement or by any other writing, shall
be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently.


15.          Borrower
and Tenant Obligated to Their Contractor(s). Borrower and Tenant shall be
obligated to their respective Contractor(s) under any Contract and under any
Construction Agreement with Borrower or Tenant respectively. Lender shall not
be responsible to Contractor for the payment or performance of any obligation
of Borrower or Tenant under any such Contract or Construction Agreement.


16.          Affidavits
of Commencement/Completion. Upon the request of Lender, or at Borrower’s
election, the Borrower shall execute and file an Affidavit of Commencement as
provided in Section 53.124 of the Texas Property Code. Upon the request of
Lender, Borrower shall execute and file an Affidavit of Completion, and send
such notices as provided in Section 53.106 of the Texas Property Code.

transactions described herein, including costs for the issuance of any
casualty, liability, and/or


9





title insurance binders or policies, recording fees, survey fees,
appraisal charges, engineering fees, inspection fees, expenses of Lender’s
counsel, loan fees, and any other costs and expenses arising pursuant to this
Agreement and/or the Loan. Lender shall have the right to pay any of such
expenses not paid by Borrower as an advance on the Loan and add the same to the
Note. Such inspection fees shall include, without limitation, the cost of professional
third party inspection company such as AECC.


18.          Assignment

the right to assign this Agreement, or any of its rights, obligations or
benefits, without first receiving the prior written consent of Lender. Subject
to the foregoing, the provisions of this Agreement, the Contract, the
Construction Agreement and all other instruments executed in connection with
the Loan and the Property, shall be binding upon the successors, legal
representatives, heirs and assigns of Borrower, and the benefits shall extend
to the successors and assigns of Lender.

sole discretion) to have occurred or be occurring, constitute an Event of

Intentionally omitted.

Tenant’s Work.













6.1
Definition. The term “Tenant’s Work” shall mean the construction
of the Building pursuant to Tenant’s Plans and Specifications.













6.2           Tenant’s
Plans and Specifications. Subject to Landlord Delays, within
ninety (90) days following the later to occur of the date (i) all
contingencies in Article XXIV of the Lease (except for that contained in
Section 24.3) have been satisfied or otherwise waived in writing by Tenant,
(ii) Tenant receives from Landlord a geotechnical report on the soils in the
Land and Tenant’s Area of Control prepared by a licensed soils engineer in
accordance with the required Utility Work and Site Work, (iii) Tenant
approves the Site Work Plans in accordance with Section 4.6 above, and (iv)
Landlord notifies Tenant in writing that Landlord has obtained the Required
Project Entitlements, Tenant will cause Tenant’s Architect to prepare and
deliver to Landlord complete plans, drawings and specifications (“Tenant’s
Plans and Specifications”) for the construction of Tenant’s Work
substantially in accordance with the elevations set forth in Addendum 3
(“Tenant’s Elevations”) and the space plans set forth in Addendum 4
(“Tenant’s Space Plans”), which Tenant’s Elevations and Tenant’s Space Plans
are hereby pre-approved by Landlord subject to Applicable Laws.













Tenant’s
Plans and Specifications will show the architectural, structural and MEP
detail for the construction of Tenant’s Work in sufficient detail as is
required to obtain necessary building permits and other approvals and for
Tenant’s contractor to prosecute the construction within the time frames set
forth in the Lease and this Exhibit C, including but not limited to: (a) the
base Building shell and other improvements constituting the Premises that are
not within the scope of Landlord’s Work; (b) all utility facilities which

condition its consent to Tenant’s Plans and Specifications. If Landlord
reasonably disapproves any material aspect of Tenant’s Plans and
Specifications, Landlord agrees to advise Tenant in writing of such
disapproval and the reasons therefor within live (5) business days of its
receipt of Tenant’s Plans and Specifications. Landlord’s failure to so notify
Tenant within such five. (5) business day period shall be deemed to be Landlord’s
approval of Tenant’s Plans and Specifications. If Landlord reasonably
disapproves any aspect of Tenant’s Plans and Specifications, Tenant and
Landlord shall then use diligent efforts to reach agreement as to Tenant’s
Plans and Specifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any approval given




25




















or deemed given by Landlord in connection with Tenant’s Plans and
Specifications or the construction work described in this Work Letter, shall
be a conceptual approval and not a technical approval. No such submission or
approval by Landlord shall be deemed to mean approval of structural capacity,
size of ducts and piping, adequacy of electrical wiring, system/equipment
capacities and, without limitation, other technical matters pertaining to
Tenant’s Work; nor shall such approval relieve Tenant of the responsibility
for proper and adequate design and construction of Tenant’s Work or
responsibility for compliance with all Applicable Laws.

ten (10) days following Landlord’s approval of Tenant’s Plans and
Specifications and to the extent permitted by the appropriate Governmental
Authorities, Tenant will submit Tenant’s Plans and Specifications to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities for plan checking and the issuance of
the Building Permit, and contemporaneously provide Landlord with a copy of
such submission. Tenant will use diligent and commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the Building Permit as soon as commercially reasonable following
the date Tenant submits for the same (subject to delays caused by the
Governmental Authorities). Tenant’s Architect shall make any and all changes
to Tenant’s Plans and Specifications required by any applicable Governmental
Authority (“Governmental Changes”) to obtain the Building Permit, and
Landlord is hereby deemed to have approved all Governmental Changes. Subject
to the immediately preceding sentence, Tenant shall make no material changes
to Tenant’s Plans and Specifications without Landlord’s reasonable written
approval (in this particular regard, only structural changes or changes to
the exterior facade of the Building shall be deemed to be “material”).
Tenant’s Work shall be constructed in a good and workmanlike manner, in
accordance with Applicable Laws and in material conformity with Tenant’s
Plans and Specifications, except where Landlord has given or is deemed to
have given prior written approval for material modifications. Tenant shall
diligently pursue the issuance of the Building Permit and agrees to respond,
to the extent reasonable, to plan review comments from the Governmental
Authorities within ten (10) days following the date such comments are
received by Tenant. Tenant shall keep Landlord promptly informed of any such
plan review comments from the Governmental Authorities.













6.3           Construction
of the Building. Subject to Landlord Delays and delays caused by
Force Majeure. Events, within twenty (20) days following the issuance of the
Building Permit and satisfaction of Delivery, Tenant will commence (“Tenant
Commencement Date”) to construct Tenant’s Work substantially in accordance
with Tenant’s Plans and Specifications and will diligently pursue completion
of the same in such a manner as to achieve substantial completion on or
before the expiration of three hundred sixty five (365) days after the Tenant
Commencement Date (subject to Landlord Delays and delays caused by Force
Majeure Events).













6.4           General
Contractor. In connection with the construction of Tenant’s Work,
Tenant shall select and use a bondable non-union general contractor,
possessing good labor relations and experienced in commercial construction.
Tenant shall have the right, but not the obligation, to select its general
contractor through a competitive bidding




26




















process. Excluding Landlord’s obligation to disburse Landlord’s
Construction Cost Contribution pursuant to this Work Letter, Landlord shall
have no obligation to Tenant’s general contractor, and Tenant’s general
contractor shall look solely to Tenant for the performance of any and all
obligations pursuant to the construction contract between Tenant and Tenant’s
general contractor. In no event is Tenant or Tenant’s general contractor
required to obtain a performance bond or any other bond in connection with
the construction of Tenant’s Work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Landlord’s lender shall require such a bond, Tenant will obtain or cause its
general contractor to obtain such bond and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant
(over and above Landlord’s Construction Cost Contribution, as defined below)
or its general contractor, as applicable, for any and all costs and expenses
incurred in the obtaining of such bond and shall provide any other assurances
or indemnities required by the surety company as a condition to issuing such
bond.













6.5           Condition
of Tenant’s Work. Tenant’s Work will be deemed to be completed at
such time as (i) Tenant’s Architect certifies in writing to Landlord that to
the best of Tenant’s Architect’s knowledge, information and belief, Tenant’s
Work has been constructed substantially in accordance with Tenant’s Plans and
Specifications, but for minor punchlist items which do not preclude Tenant
from opening or operating the Premises for the Primary Uses, and (ii) a
certificate of occupancy, temporary certificate of occupancy, final building
department sign-off or the equivalent has been issued.













6.6           Warranties.
Tenant shall assign to Landlord all of the warranties Tenant obtains in
connection with the construction of Tenant’s Work to the extent Landlord is
obligated to maintain and repair the same under the Lease. Tenant shall
retain rights to enforce such warranties in the event Landlord breaches its
maintenance and repair obligations.










7.


Landlord’s Construction Cost Contribution.













7.1           Construction

Lease, Landlord shall provide construction funding to Tenant (“Landlord’s
Construction Cost Contribution”) for the purpose of planning, designing,
permitting and constructing Tenant’s Work up to the amount of Four Million
Six Hundred Eighty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($4,680,000.00) (based on
$104.00 per square foot of the Premises). Landlord’s Construction Cost
Contribution may be used by Tenant to pay for any costs associated with the
improvement of the Premises for Tenant’s use (including, without limitation,

7.3     Building
Permits and Certificates of Occupancy. Landlord will fully
cooperate with Tenant in obtaining the Building Permit, all other permits for
the construction of Tenant’s Work required by Governmental Authorities, and
all required certificates of occupancy.




8.       Landlord
Delays. For purposes of the Lease and this Work Letter, the term “Landlord
Delays” means any delay in the completion of Tenant’s Work or any delay in the
opening of the Premises for business to the general public resulting from any
or all of the following: (i) Landlord’s failure to timely perform any of its
obligations pursuant to this Work Letter including, without limitation, the
timely completion of Landlord’s Work and the timely payment of Landlord’s
Construction Cost Contribution, or (ii) Landlord’s changes to any of the
Conceptual Engineering Package, the Site Plan Submittal Package, or the Site
Work Plans after Tenant’s approval thereof pursuant to the terms of this Work
Letter.


9.       Defaults.
Time is of the essence for each party’s obligations hereunder. If Landlord
fails to perform any of its obligations within the timeframes set forth herein,
Tenant may avail itself of the following remedies:













9.1     Monetary
Default. If Landlord fails to pay any sum due to Tenant pursuant
to the terms of this Work Letter, then such sum shall accrue interest at the
Interest Rate from the date due until paid in full, and Tenant may bring suit
for collection against Landlord




29




















for such amounts. In addition, Tenant shall
have the right to offset the amount due, together with interest at the
interest Rate, against Minimum Rent and other charges due from Tenant to
Landlord under the Lease until Tenant has received all sums due under the
Lease and Work Letter. In addition, if Landlord fails to pay Tenant any
portion of Landlord’s Construction Cost Contribution, Tenant may cease
construction of Tenant’s Work until such time as Tenant has received such
payment.













9.2     Non-monetary
Default. In addition to any and all other remedies available to
Tenant hereunder or by law, but subject to Force Majeure Events and delays
caused by Tenant or Tenant’s employees, contractors or agents, if Landlord
fails to commence construction within the time period specified in Section
4.7 above or if Tenant reasonably determines that the construction of
Landlord’s Work is not proceeding so as to be completed within the time
limits agreed to in Section 4 above, Tenant may give written notice of such
fact to Landlord. If within ten (10) days of Landlord’s receipt of Tenant’s
written notice Landlord does not present to Tenant evidence reasonably
acceptable to Tenant that Landlord’s Work will be commenced or completed as
required, then Tenant shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume
control of the portion of Landlord’s Work made the basis of Tenant’s written
notice (a “Takeover Notice”). In such event, Tenant shall have the right to
modify the Site Work Plans as Tenant reasonably deems advisable in order to
complete the portion of Landlord’s Work over which Tenant has assumed control
so as to accommodate Tenant’s need to open on schedule. Landlord hereby
grants to Tenant, its contractors, agents and employees a temporary license
to enter upon the Land and Tenant’s Area of Control for the purpose of
performing all or any part of Landlord’s Work. Landlord shall remain liable for
payment of the costs associated with Landlord’s Work. If Landlord fails to
pay for Landlord’s Work, then the amounts owed to Tenant shall bear interest
at the Interest Rate from the date due until paid, and Tenant may offset such
amounts against Minimum Rent and other sums first coming due under the Lease
until Tenant has been fully reimbursed.













9.3     Certificate
of Occupancy. If a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy
(or its equivalent) cannot be issued after Tenant’s Work is complete due to
incompleteness of or defects in Landlord’s Work, then, notwithstanding
anything contained in the Lease to the contrary and without limiting any
other rights or remedies of Tenant, for each day that Tenant is delayed in
opening for business within the Premises, Tenant shall be given two (2) days
of Minimum Rent and Additional Rent free for every day until Landlord’s Work
is completed or corrected and a temporary or permanent certificate of
occupancy (or its equivalent) is issued and delivered to Tenant permitting
use of the Premises for the Primary Uses.













9.4     Cumulative
Remedies. The remedies provided in this Section 9 are in addition
to any remedies available elsewhere in this Work Letter, in the Lease, or
under Applicable Law. Exercise of one remedy shall not be deemed to preclude
exercise of other remedies for the same default, and all remedies available
to Tenant may be exercised cumulatively.




10.     Intentionally
omitted.

11.     Temporary
Easements.













11.1     Mutual
Easements. By executing the Lease, Landlord and Tenant each grants
and conveys to the other and the other’s contractors, materialmen or workmen,
such temporary licenses of passage and use over and across the Project as are
reasonably necessary for Tenant to construct Tenant’s Work, or to perform any
maintenance or other work required to be performed by Tenant under the Lease,
and for Landlord to construct Landlord’s Work or to perform any maintenance
or other work required to be performed by Landlord under the Lease. In
addition, Landlord grants to Tenant an easement and right to use one of the
two (2) agreeable staging areas within the Land as depicted on the Site Plan
for the purpose of storage of materials and equipment during the construction
of Tenant’s Work; provided, Tenant shall initially use Staging Area A, but
upon Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s written request, Tenant shall use Staging
Area B in lieu of Staging Area A; provided further, Landlord shall not
request Tenant use an alternative agreeable staging area more than once
during the construction of Tenant’s Work. This reciprocal grant is subject to
the conditions that (i) such licenses will be in effect only during periods
when actual construction or maintenance is performed and in any event will
terminate upon the termination of the Lease, and (ii) such licenses will be
exercised so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use and operation of
the affected areas.













11.2     Construction
Easements. By executing the Lease, Landlord does hereby grant
Tenant an easement in the area beneath Tenant’s Work for the purpose of
constructing foundations, pylons and other necessary building support for the
construction of Tenant’s Work and for the repair and maintenance of the same.
This easement will remain in effect for the full Term of the Lease or until
any earlier termination in accordance with its terms.




12.     Ownership of
Tenant’s Work. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that upon payment in
full of Landlord’s Construction Cost Contribution to Tenant, Tenant’s Work and
any and all improvements at any time constructed, placed or maintained on or
under any part of the Premises (exclusive of Tenant’s Personal Property) will
be and remain the property of Landlord.


13.     Insurance.
Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Landlord, and Landlord’s members,
partners, employees and agents, from all liability in connection with Tenant’s
Work and Landlord agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Tenant, and Tenant’s
members, partners, employees and agents, from all liability in connection with
Landlord’s Work. During performance of any work under this Work Letter or the
Lease, the parties shall provide or cause their contractor(s) to provide,
insurance as specified in Addendum 5 hereto and such insurance as may from time
to time be required by city, county, state or federal laws, codes, regulations
or authorities, together with such other insurance as is reasonably necessary
or appropriate under the circumstances. All insurance policies required under
Addendum 5 shall provide that Landlord or Tenant (as applicable) shall be given
thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of any alteration or termination of
coverage.


14.     Addenda.
The parties agree that all addenda attached to this Work Letter are hereby
incorporated by reference and arc made a part of this Work Letter and the
Lease.

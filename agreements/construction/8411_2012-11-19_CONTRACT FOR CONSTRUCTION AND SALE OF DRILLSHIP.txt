However, the total of liquidated damages shall not exceed the amount due to cover a delay of one hundred eighty (180) days counting from midnight of the fourty-fifth (45th) day after the DELIVERY DATE at the above specified rate of reduction.
(c)    If such delay in DELIVERY of the DRILLSHIP continues, for which BUILDER is liable, for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days or more from the fourty-sixth (46th) day after the DELIVERY DATE, in such event and after such period has expired, BUYER may, at its option, terminate this CONTRACT in accordance with the provisions of Article X.1(c) or accept the DRILLSHIP with a total reduction in the CONTRACT PRICE equal to five percent (5%) of the CONTRACT PRICE less the PC SUM.

However, if the actual operating variable deck load of the DRILLSHIP on DELIVERY is reduced by more than five percent (5%) of the SPECIFIED OPERATING VARIABLE DECK LOAD, the CONTRACT PRICE shall be reduced by USD 3,000.00 per Metric Ton for a deficiency in excess of five percent (5%) of the SPECIFIED OPERATING VARIABLE DECK LOAD.  If the deficiency in any variable loads as set out in this Article III.2 exceeds ten percent (10%) of the SPECIFIED OPERATING VARIABLE DECK LOAD, BUYER shall have the right to terminate this CONTRACT.
3.    Insufficient Speed:
(e)    The CONTRACT PRICE of the DRILLSHIP shall not be affected or changed if the actual speed, as determined by sea trials, is less than the guaranteed speed under the SPECIFICATIONS, provided such deficiency in actual speed is not more than four-tenths (4/10) of a knot below the guaranteed speed.
(f)    However, as for the deficiency of more than four-tenths (4/10) of a knot in actual speed below the speed guaranteed under this CONTRACT, the CONTRACT PRICE shall be reduced by USD 100,000.00 for each full one-tenth (1/10) of a knot in excess of the said four-tenths (4/10) of a knot of deficiency in speed; provided that fractions of less than one-tenth (1/10) of a knot shall be regarded as a full one-tenth (1/10) of a knot.  However, unless the parties agree otherwise, the total amount of reduction from the CONTRACT PRICE shall not exceed the amount due to cover the deficiency of one (1) full knot below the guaranteed speed at the rate of reduction as specified above.
(g)    If the deficiency in actual speed of the DRILLSHIP is more than one (1) full knot below the speed guaranteed under this CONTRACT, BUYER, at its option, may, subject to the BUILDER’s right to effect alterations or corrections, cancel this CONTRACT or may accept the DRILLSHIP at a reduction in the CONTRACT PRICE as above provided for one (1) full knot of deficiency only.

Failure by the REPRESENTATIVE to be present at such tests, trials and inspections after due notice to him as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a waiver of the REPRESENTATIVE’s right to be present.  In the event that BUILDER needs an inspection for coating work to be made during non-working hours for smooth progress of work, the REPRESENTATIVE shall exercise his best endeavours to attend such inspection provided that BUILDER has given a reasonable advance notice to the REPRESENTATIVE.
(c)    In working hours during construction of the DRILLSHIP until DELIVERY thereof, the REPRESENTATIVE shall, subject to the reasonable requirements of the SHIPYARD’s work program and safety control, be permitted free and ready access to the DRILLSHIP, her machinery and equipment, and to any other place where work on the DRILLSHIP is being done, or materials are being processed or stored in connection with the construction of the DRILLSHIP, including the yards, workshops, stores and offices of BUILDER, and the premises of subcontractors of BUILDER, who are doing work or storing materials in connection with the DRILLSHIP’s construction.
(d)    If the REPRESENTATIVE discovers any construction, material or workmanship which he considers not to conform to the requirements of this CONTRACT and/or the SPECIFICATIONS, the REPRESENTATIVE shall promptly give BUILDER a notice in writing specifying the alleged non-conformity. Upon receipt of such notice from the REPRESENTATIVE, BUILDER shall correct such non-conformity, if BUILDER agrees to his view.  Any disagreement shall be resolved in accordance with Article XIII.1.
(e)    If the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY, TECHNICAL EXPERT or arbitrator enters a determination in favour of BUYER, then in such case BUILDER shall correct such non-conformity, or if such corrections cannot be made in time to meet the construction schedule

12










for the DRILLSHIP, the then parties shall mutually agree to an adjustment of the CONTRACT PRICE in lieu of such corrections.  If the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY, TECHNICAL EXPERT or the arbitrator enters a determination in favour of BUILDER, then the time for DELIVERY of the DRILLSHIP shall be extended for the period of delay in construction, if any, occasioned by such proceedings, and BUYER shall compensate BUILDER for the proven loss and damages directly incurred by BUILDER under this CONTRACT as a result of such dispute; provided that BUILDER shall be required to take reasonable endeavors to mitigate any losses and/or damages incurred in connection with such dispute and no special or consequential damages may be recouped.
(f)      In the event the arbitrator enters a determination in favour of BUYER and determines that such corrections cannot be made prior to the two hundred tenth (210th) day following the DELIVERY DATE pursuant to Article III.1, then BUYER is entitled to terminate this CONTRACT.
4.    Facilities:
(a)    BUILDER shall furnish BUYER with office space to accommodate a sixty (60) person site team including a locker room and coffee room equipped with refrigerator and industrial-sized coffee maker; office space to accommodate a sixty (60) person operations team, including a locker room and coffee room equipped with a refrigerator and industrial-sized coffee maker; and each of the above-listed office spaces is to have a minimum of eight (8) private offices, with all desks to be outfitted with an Internet connection and electrical plugs, a large dedicated file room, two (2) meeting rooms able to accommodate fifty (50) persons each and complete with a large table and chairs; one hundred (100) bicycles upon BUYER’s request on a reimbursable basis; twenty (20) dedicated parking spaces; bottled water and dispensers upon BUYER’S request on a reimbursable basis; unlimited high speed internet service upon BUYER’S request on a reimbursable basis; four (4) print/scan/email workstations networked and all required paper upon BUYER’s request on a reimbursable basis; a full size plotter and all required paper upon BUYER’s request on a reimbursable basis; storage space for BUYER’S SUPPLIES, with BUILDER to transport from storage and load onto the DRILLSHIP all BUYER’S SUPPLIES. This replaces the facilities requirement under Article IV.4(a) of the ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT.
(b)    Upon exercise of the OPTION (as defined in the OPTION AGREEMENT), BUILDER agrees to furnish BUYER with the office facilities and parking spaces referenced in Article IV.4(a) of the ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT with a maximum of the amounts set forth therein multiplied by 1.67; provided, however, that upon BUYER’s request on a reimbursable basis a total of one hundred fifty (150) bicycles shall be provided.
Provided, however, that BUYER shall pay telecommunication charges including telephone and email, and shall reimburse costs and expenses for supply and installation of telefax or external telephone lines and other facilities and office equipment and furniture, if any, provided in addition to the above upon BUYER’s request.
5.    Liability of BUILDER and BUYER:
(a)    The REPRESENTATIVE(S) shall at all times be deemed to be the employee(s) of BUYER and not of BUILDER.

13










(b)    BUILDER agrees to protect, indemnify and hold BUYER free and harmless from and against any and all claims or liabilities (including, without limitation, the cost of the suit and reasonable attorney’s fees) arising in favour of any of BUILDER’s (or its AFFILIATES), employees, agents, officers, invitees, subcontractors (or their servants) or representatives, or any survivor of the foregoing on account of injury to or death of any such parties or damage to any of their property attributable to the actions (or lack thereof) by any such parties in connection with the DRILLSHIP and/or work performed pursuant to this CONTRACT, regardless of whether BUYER and/or its subcontractors and/or others may be wholly, partially or solely negligent or otherwise at fault.
(c)    BUYER agrees to protect, indemnify and hold BUILDER and its subcontractors free and harmless from and against any and all claims or liabilities (including, without limitation, the cost of the suit and reasonable attorney’s fees) arising in favour of any of BUYER’s (or its AFFILIATES) employees, agents, officers, invitees, subcontractors (or their servants) or representatives, or any survivor of any of the foregoing on account of injury to or death of any such parties or damage to any of their property except as regards DRILLSHIP attributable to the actions (or lack thereof) by any such parties in connection with the DRILLSHIP and/or work performed pursuant to this CONTRACT, regardless of whether BUILDER or its subcontractors and/or others may be wholly, partially or solely negligent or otherwise at fault.
6.    Responsibility of BUYER:
(d)    BUYER shall advise BUILDER in advance of the names, experiences and scope of authority of the REPRESENTATIVE(s) and of any other information pertaining to their qualifications.  If BUILDER shall have reasonable cause to disapprove of any of the REPRESENTATIVE(s), it shall so advise BUYER and BUYER shall take proper action.
(e)    BUYER shall undertake and assure that its REPRESENTATIVE(s) shall carry out their duties hereunder in accordance with BUILDER’s good practice and in such a way as to avoid any unnecessary increase in building cost or delay in the production schedules of BUILDER.  The REPRESENTATIVE(s) shall abide by the work rules and regulations prevailing at the premises of BUILDER and its subcontractors.
(f)    BUILDER has the right to request BUYER to replace any REPRESENTATIVE(s) if deemed unsuitable and unsatisfactory for the proper progress of the DRILLSHIP’s construction.  If BUYER considers that such BUILDER’s request is justified, BUYER shall effect such replacement as soon as practicable

14










ARTICLE V
MODIFICATIONS
1.    Modification of SPECIFICATIONS:
(h)    Any MODIFICATION or variation of or amendment to the SPECIFICATIONS shall be evidenced by written agreement of the parties hereto (a “CHANGE ORDER”); provided, prior to any MODIFICATION or variation being effected by the BUILDER, the parties shall first agree to alterations in the CONTRACT PRICE, the DELIVERY DATE, lightship weight and other terms and conditions of this CONTRACT and SPECIFICATIONS occasioned by or resulting from such MODIFICATION or variation within seven (7) days from the receipt by BUYER of BUILDER’s proposal.  BUILDER has the right to continue construction of the DRILLSHIP on the basis of the SPECIFICATIONS until agreement to the above has been reached.
(i)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, BUILDER may also make minor changes to the SPECIFICATIONS including, but not limited to, the dimensions and characteristics of the DRILLSHIP, if found necessary to suit the SHIPYARD’s local conditions and facilities, the availability of materials and equipment, introduction of improved methods or otherwise, provided that BUILDER shall first obtain BUYER’s written (which expression includes e-mail communication) approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(j)    Upon receiving a written request for MODIFICATION from BUYER, BUILDER will submit to BUYER in writing within twenty one (21) working days a quotation of the change in the CONTRACT PRICE and/or DELIVERY DATE (if any) as a result of alterations and adjustments required to the SPECIFICATIONS.
(k)    In the event that BUYER requests any change that would result in a net savings in cost then, subject to negotiations between the parties, the cost saving shall be to BUYER’s benefit and be credited in the final accounts on delivery of the DRILLSHIP.
(l)    The parties agree that if any MODIFICATIONS are to be made to both SPECIFICATIONS of the DRILLSHIP and UNIT 2 after the EFFECTIVE DATE of this CONTRACT, the BUILDER’s quotations to adjust the CONTRACT PRICE for such MODIFICATIONS as set forth in Article V.4 shall reflect the amount saved by the BUILDER by reason that the plans or drawings and related engineering works done for the UNIT 2 may be applied or used also for the DRILLSHIP or vice versa. Any CHANGE ORDERS for UNIT 2 agreed to on or before the EFFECTIVE DATE of this CONTRACT shall be treated as part of the SPECIFICATIONS for the DRILLSHIP and not as CHANGE ORDERS, and for such purpose, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the forty-two (42) CHANGE ORDERS for UNIT 2 having BUILDER’s number 1 to 42 are treated as part of the SPECIFICATIONS for the DRILLSHIP and therefore the amounts representing such forty-two (42) CHANGE ORDERS have been included in the CONTRACT PRICE, and  (ii) if any CHANGE ORDERS having BUILDER’s number forty-three (43) or higher are agreed to by the parties for UNIT 2, such CHANGE ORDERS shall also be applied to the DRILLSHIP and such CHANGE ORDERS shall be regarded as CHANGE ORDERS under this CONTRACT. Therefore, the amounts for such CHANGE ORDERS shall be paid on top of the CONTRACT PRICE.
2.    Change in Class and Statutory Requirements

15










(g)    If after the EFFECTIVE DATE, any requirements of the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY, or of other rules and regulations specified in Article I.4 (or the interpretation thereof by the relevant body) to which the construction of the DRILLSHIP is required to conform, are changed by the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY or other regulatory bodies authorized to make such changes, the following provisions shall apply unless a waiver of the changed requirement, rule, regulation or interpretation is obtained pursuant to BUYER’s request:
(1)    If the changes are compulsory for the DRILLSHIP, either of the parties hereto, upon receipt of information from the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY or such other regulatory bodies, shall promptly transmit the same to the other in writing, and BUILDER shall thereupon incorporate such changes into the construction of the DRILLSHIP, provided that BUYER shall first have agreed to adjustments required by BUILDER in the CONTRACT PRICE, the DELIVERY DATE, lightship weight and other terms and conditions of this CONTRACT and the SPECIFICATIONS occasioned by or resulting from such changes within seven (7) days from the receipt by BUYER of BUILDER’s proposal.
(2)    If the changes are not compulsory for the DRILLSHIP, but BUYER desires to incorporate any of them into the construction of the DRILLSHIP, BUYER shall notify BUILDER of that intention.  BUILDER may accept such changes, provided that such changes will not in its reasonable judgment adversely affect BUILDER’s planning or program in relation to BUILDER’s other commitments, and provided, further, that BUYER shall first have agreed to adjustments required by BUILDER in the CONTRACT PRICE, the DELIVERY DATE, and other terms and conditions of this CONTRACT and the SPECIFICATIONS occasioned by or resulting from such changes within seven (7) days from the receipt by BUYER of BUILDER’s proposal.
(h)    Agreements as to any changes under this Article V.2 shall be made in the same manner as provided in Article V.1 for MODIFICATIONS or changes to the SPECIFICATIONS.
(i)    Any delay in the construction of the DRILLSHIP caused by BUYER’s delay in making a decision or agreement as above shall constitute a permissible delay under this CONTRACT.
3.    Substitution of Materials:
If any of the materials or equipment required by the SPECIFICATIONS or otherwise under this CONTRACT for the construction of the DRILLSHIP are in short supply or cannot be procured in time to maintain the DELIVERY DATE of the DRILLSHIP or are unreasonably high in price as compared with prevailing international market rates, BUILDER may, provided that BUYER shall so agree in writing (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld), supply other materials capable of meeting the requirements of the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY and of the rules, regulations and requirements with which the construction of the DRILLSHIP must comply.  Any agreement as to substitution of materials shall be effected in the manner as provided in Article V.1.
4.    Adjustment to CONTRACT PRICE and DELIVERY by MODIFICATIONS:
In relation to this Article V, the BUILDER’s quotations in respect of any increase or decrease in the CONTRACT PRICE or any MODIFICATION shall be calculated and submitted on “lump sum” basis for the adjustment to the CONTRACT PRICE.  BUYER may contest the reasonableness of BUILDER’s proposal based on a lump sum.  In case such contest by BUYER is on reasonable grounds only and

16










BUILDER agrees on the BUYER’s contest and opinion therein, then “time and materials” basis shall be applied to settle pricing of the modifications as defined below in subparagraphs (a) and (b).  BUYER’s written notification shall be received by BUILDER within ten (10) days of the date of BUILDER’s quotations.
(d)    Labour costs shall be charged at the agreed hourly rates set out in EXHIBIT B.
(e)    The cost of materials and equipment shall be fifteen per cent (15%) in addition to the cost of the BUILDER.
In respect of costs not set out in EXHIBIT B, the BUYER and the BUILDER shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on such price for the modifications. If no agreement is reached within thirty (30) days following receipt by BUILDER of BUYER’s written notification as set out in this paragraph above, the dispute shall be referred to the TECHNICAL EXPERT in accordance with Article XIII.1(b) of this CONTRACT.
Adjustment to the contractual DELIVERY DATE in respect of this Article V shall be subject to effect on critical paths in the DRILLSHIP’s construction and completion.
5.    Payment for MODIFICATIONS:
Any sums due to either party under Article V as a result of MODIFICATIONS shall be paid as follows but in any event prior to DELIVERY of the DRILLSHIP:
(g)    50% of any lump sum amount shall be paid upon the agreement of MODIFICATIONS or immediately following a decision by the TECHNICAL EXPERT in accordance with Article XIII.1(b) of this CONTRACT. Any amount based on time and materials shall be paid as accrued.
(h)    The remaining 50% of the lump sum amount shall be paid upon the completion of MODIFICATIONS in accordance with the CONTRACT.





17










ARTICLE VI
SEA TRIAL
1.    Notices:
BUILDER shall notify BUYER at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the expected time and place of the sea trial of the DRILLSHIP, and BUYER shall promptly acknowledge receipt of such notice.  Such date shall be confirmed by BUILDER at least five (5) days in advance.  However, if the sea trial of the DRILLSHIP is postponed or delayed due to unfavourable weather conditions and/or unreadiness of the DRILLSHIP for the sea trial then BUILDER shall give BUYER as much advance notice of the new date of sea trials as practicable.
BUYER shall have the REPRESENTATIVE(S) and such other persons as BUYER may require in writing on board the DRILLSHIP to witness the sea trial.  Failure by the REPRESENTATIVE(S) to attend the sea trial of the DRILLSHIP for any reason whatsoever after due notice to BUYER as above provided shall be deemed to be a waiver by BUYER of its right to have the REPRESENTATIVE(S) on board the DRILLSHIP at the sea trial, and BUILDER may conduct the sea trial without the REPRESENTATIVE(S) being present, provided that a representative of the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY shall be on board the DRILLSHIP for such sea trial. In such case BUYER shall be obliged to accept the DRILLSHIP on the basis of a certificate of BUILDER, confirmed by the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY, if applicable, that the DRILLSHIP, on the sea trial, is found to conform to this CONTRACT and the SPECIFICATIONS.  In any event BUILDER shall promptly supply to BUYER a copy of all records of tests and trials carried out with regard to the DRILLSHIP, her machinery and equipment.
2.    Weather Conditions:
The sea trial shall be carried out under weather conditions which are deemed favourable enough in the reasonable judgement of BUILDER in accordance with the SPECIFICATIONS.  In the event of unfavourable weather on the date specified for the sea trial, the same shall take place on the first available day thereafter that weather conditions permit.
It is agreed that if during the sea trial the weather should suddenly become so unfavourable that the satisfactory conduct of the sea trial can no longer be continued, the sea trial shall be discontinued and postponed until the next following favourable day, unless BUYER shall assent in writing to a request from BUILDER to accept the DRILLSHIP on the basis of the sea trial already made before such discontinuance occurred.
Any delay in the sea trial caused by unfavourable weather conditions shall be deemed a permissible delay in the delivery of the DRILLSHIP and shall operate to postpone the DELIVERY DATE by the period of delay involved.
3.    How Conducted:
(f)    All expenses in connection with the sea trial are for the account of BUILDER, and BUILDER shall provide at its own expense the necessary crew to comply with the requirements of safe navigation.  The sea trial shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in the SPECIFICATIONS and shall prove fulfillment of the performance requirements for the sea trial as set forth in the SPECIFICATIONS.  The course of the sea trial shall be determined by BUILDER.  BUILDER shall have the right to conduct preliminary trials and to repeat any trial whatsoever as it deems necessary.

18










(g)    Lubricating oils, fuel oils, hydraulic oils and greases or other consumable stores (excluding fresh water) necessary for sea trials shall be supplied by BUILDER, as specified by BUYER prior to conducting such sea trials, and BUYER shall pay BUILDER the documented cost of the lubricating oils, fuel oils, hydraulic oils and grease, inclusive of any quantities remaining in machinery or piping, as applicable, remaining at the time of DELIVERY.
4.    Method of Acceptance or Rejection:
(i)    If during sea trial any breakdowns occur entailing interruption or irregular performance which can be repaired on board, the trial shall be continued after repairs and be valid in all respects.
(j)    As soon as practicable after satisfactory completion of the sea trial, BUILDER shall give BUYER a report thereon and notice that the results of the sea trial indicate conformity of the DRILLSHIP to this CONTRACT and the SPECIFICATIONS.  BUYER shall, within seven (7) days after receipt of such notice from BUILDER, notify BUILDER of its acceptance or rejection of the DRILLSHIP on the basis of its conformity with the requirements of this CONTRACT and the SPECIFICATIONS.
(k)    If the results of the sea trial indicate that the DRILLSHIP or any part or equipment thereof does not conform to the requirements of this CONTRACT and/or the SPECIFICATIONS, then BUILDER shall take the necessary steps to correct such non-conformity.  Upon completion of the correction of such non-conformity, BUILDER shall give BUYER notice thereof.  BUYER shall, within seven (7) days after receipt of such notice from BUILDER, notify BUILDER of its acceptance or rejection of the DRILLSHIP.  However, BUYER shall not be entitled to reject the DRILLSHIP by reason of any minor or insubstantial defect or non-conformity, which can be judged from the viewpoint of standard building practice as applied to international offshore drillships and which does not effect the issuance of required certificates from the CLASSIFICATION SOCIETY and other regulatory bodies or the operability, function or performance of the DRILLSHIP, but in such case, the BUILDER shall not be released from its obligation to correct and/or remedy such minor or insubstantial non-conformity as far as practicable during the WARRANTY PERIOD.
(l)    If BUYER considers that the results of the sea trial indicate that the DRILLSHIP or any part or equipment thereof does not conform to this CONTRACT and/or the SPECIFICATIONS, BUYER shall indicate in detail in a notice of rejection in what respect the DRILLSHIP or any part or equipment thereof, does not in its opinion conform to this CONTRACT and/or the SPECIFICATIONS.
(m)    If BUYER fails to notify BUILDER in writing or email confirmed in writing of the acceptance or rejection of the DRILLSHIP together with the reason therefore within the period as provided in Article VI.4 (b) or (c), BUYER shall be deemed to have accepted the DRILLSHIP.
(n)    BUILDER may dispute the rejection of the DRILLSHIP by BUYER under this Article VI.4, in which case the matter shall be submitted for final decision by arbitration in accordance with Article XIII.
5.    Effect of Acceptance:

19










Acceptance of the DRILLSHIP as above provided shall be final and binding so far as the conformity of the DRILLSHIP to this CONTRACT and the SPECIFICATIONS is concerned, and shall preclude BUYER from refusing formal delivery of the DRILLSHIP as hereinafter provided, if BUILDER complies with all procedural requirements for DELIVERY of the DRILLSHIP as provided in Article VII.

20

ARTICLE VIII
DELAYS AND EXTENSION OF TIME FOR DELIVERY (FORCE MAJEURE)
1.    Causes of Delay:
If at any time before the DELIVERY of the DRILLSHIP, either the construction of the DRILLSHIP or any performance required hereunder is delayed due to Acts of God; acts of princes or rulers; requirements of government authorities; war or acts of war or preparations therefore; blockade, revolution, insurrections, mobilization of armed forces, civil war, civil commotion or riots; vandalism; sabotage; strikes, lockouts or other labour disturbances by such reasons not related to BUILDER or its AFFILIATES; plague or other epidemics; quarantines; flood, typhoons, hurricanes or cyclonic storms; earthquakes; tidal waves; landslides; fires, lightning strikes, or explosions; embargoes; prolonged failure, shortage or restriction of electric current, oil or gas supplies; and delays in deliveries of major parts (inclusive of the drilling equipment package and the subsea equipment package) or performance of major obligations by subcontractors or suppliers by such causes described herein; then and in any such case, the DELIVERY DATE shall be postponed for such period as the DELIVERY of the DRILLSHIP is delayed thereby.
2.    Definition of Permissible Delay:
Delay on account of such cause as specified in Articles V.4, VI.2, VIII.1, XI.1, XVII.1 and any other delays of a nature which under the terms of this CONTRACT permit postponement of the DELIVERY DATE shall be understood to be permissible delays, which shall not be subject to adjustment of the CONTRACT PRICE as provided in Article III.1.
3.    Notice of Delay:
(k)    Within ten (10) days after the commencement of any cause of delay on account of which BUILDER claims that it is entitled under this CONTRACT to a postponement of the DELIVERY DATE, BUILDER shall (if practically possible) notify BUYER of the dates, the cause of delay which has occurred and its expected duration.
(l)    Within ten (10) days after the ending of such cause of delay, if practically possible, BUILDER shall notify BUYER in writing of the date such cause of delay ended.
(m)    BUILDER shall also notify BUYER of the period by which the DELIVERY DATE is postponed by reason of such cause of delay with all reasonable dispatch after it has been determined.  Failure by BUYER to object to BUILDER’s claim for postponement of the DELIVERY DATE within ten (10) days after receipt by BUYER of such notice of claim shall be deemed to be a waiver by BUYER of its right to object to such postponement of the DELIVERY DATE.
4.    Right to Terminate CONTRACT for Excessive Delay:
If the total accumulated time of all permissible delays on account of the causes specified in Article VIII.1 (but excluding delays caused by any error or omission on the part of BUYER and any other delays which under the terms of this CONTRACT permit postponement of the DELIVERY DATE) amounts to two hundred and ten (210) days or more, then, in such event, BUYER may terminate this CONTRACT in accordance with the provisions of Article X.  If BUYER has not served notice of termination as provided in Article X, BUILDER may, at any time after the said accumulated time justifying termination by BUYER has occurred, notify BUYER of the expected future date for DELIVERY and demand in writing that BUYER shall make an election, in which case BUYER shall,

24










within ten (10) days after such demand is delivered to BUYER, notify BUILDER of either its termination of this CONTRACT or its acceptance of the revised future date for DELIVERY specified by BUILDER.  If the DRILLSHIP is not DELIVERED by such revised future date, BUYER shall have the same right of termination upon the same terms and conditions as above provided as if the said revised future date for DELIVERY was the DELIVERY DATE as defined in Article VII.  If BUYER fails to notify BUILDER of its termination of this CONTRACT as specified above within such ten (10) days period, BUYER shall be deemed to have consented to the DELIVERY of the DRILLSHIP at the revised future date for DELIVERY.
If any termination of the CONTRACT is based on any of the permissible delays on account of the causes specified in this Article VIII.1 of the CONTRACT, no interest shall be payable by BUILDER.



25










ARTICLE IX
WARRANTY OF QUALITY
1.    Guarantee:
BUILDER warrants that the material and workmanship employed in the construction of the DRILLSHIP shall be free from defects and shall comply with this CONTRACT.  Subject to the provisions hereinafter set out, BUILDER undertakes to remedy or replace, free of charge to BUYER, any defects in the DRILLSHIP which are due to defective material and/or improper workmanship on the part of BUILDER and/or its subcontractors, provided that the defects shall appear or be discovered during a period of twelve (12) months after the ACTUAL DELIVERY DATE (the “WARRANTY PERIOD”) if notice thereof is duly given to BUILDER; provided however that the WARRANTY PERIOD shall be extended for a further period of nine (9) months in respect of any work done by BUILDER to remedy any defect under this Article IX. For the purpose of this Article IX, the DRILLSHIP includes her hull, machinery, equipment and gear, but excludes material, machinery and equipment which have been supplied by BUYER.
2.    Extent of BUILDER’s Responsibility:
(n)    BUILDER shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for any defects in the DRILLSHIP other than the defects so specified in Article IX.1, and BUILDER shall not be liable in any circumstances whatsoever for any consequential or special losses, damages or expenses including, but not limited to, loss of time, loss of profit or earnings or demurrage directly or indirectly occasioned to BUYER by reason of the defects specified in Article IX.1 nor owing to repairs or other works done to the DRILLSHIP to remedy such defects.
(o)    BUILDER shall not be responsible for any defects in any part of the DRILLSHIP which may subsequent to DELIVERY of the DRILLSHIP have been replaced or in any way repaired by any other contractors (except those approved by BUILDER), nor for any defect which has been caused or aggravated by omission or improper use and maintenance of the DRILLSHIP on the part of BUYER, its servants or agents or by ordinary wear and tear or by perils of the sea, rivers or navigations or by corrosion of the materials or by accidents or fire or by any other circumstances whatsoever beyond the control of BUILDER.
(p)    The undertakings contained in this Article shall replace and exclude any other liability, guarantee, warranty and/or condition imposed or implied by LAW, customary, statutory or otherwise, by reason of the construction and sale of the DRILLSHIP by BUILDER for and to BUYER.
3.    Remedy of Defects:
(a)    BUILDER shall remedy at its expense any defects, against which the DRILLSHIP is warranted under this Article by making all necessary repairs or replacements at the SHIPYARD.
(b)    However, if it is impractical to bring the DRILLSHIP to the SHIPYARD, BUYER shall cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made at another place suitable for the purpose, provided that, in such event, BUILDER shall forward, procure or supply replacement parts or materials to the DRILLSHIP on cost, insurance and freight (“CIF”) terms unless such forwarding or supply thereof to the DRILLSHIP would impair or delay the operation or working schedule of the DRILLSHIP.  In this case, BUYER shall be responsible for handling

26










of the replacement parts or materials after BUILDER’s CIF delivery. Thereafter, BUYER shall first try to have the defects be remedied by the DRILLSHIP’s crew as far as practically possible, in which case no compensation by BUILDER shall be made to BUYER for the works performed by the DRILLSHIP’s crew.
(3)    If BUYER proposes to cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made to DRILLSHIP at any yard or works other than the SHIPYARD, BUYER shall before doing so, and in any event as soon as possible, give BUILDER notice of the time and place where such repairs will be made.  If the DRILLSHIP is not thereby delayed, nor her operation or working schedule thereby materially impaired, BUILDER shall have the right to verify by its own or appointed representative(s) the nature and extent of the defects complained of.  BUILDER shall, in such case, promptly advise BUYER after such examination has been completed, of its acceptance or rejection of defects as being covered by the undertakings hereby provided.
(4)    Upon BUILDER’s acceptance of defects as justifying remedy under this Article IX.3(b), or upon the final award of an arbitration so determining, BUILDER shall reimburse BUYER the documented expenses incurred by BUYER, at completion of the repair or at the time of final award of an arbitration, as the case may be, but such  reimbursement shall not exceed the reasonably estimated cost of carrying out the warranty work at the SHIPYARD.
(c)    In any case, the DRILLSHIP shall be taken at BUYER’s risk and expense to the place chosen, ready in all respects for such repairs or replacements and BUILDER shall not be responsible for towage, dockage, wharfage, port charges, inspection and underwater survey costs for defects finding, and anything else incurred in BUYER’s getting and keeping the DRILLSHIP ready for such repairs and replacements.
(d)    BUILDER shall have the option to retrieve at its own cost any of the replaced equipment and parts where the defects are remedied in accordance with the provisions of this Article IX.
(e)    Any dispute under this Article shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII.1(b).
4.    Notice of Defects:
BUYER shall notify BUILDER in writing of any defects for which a claim is made under this Article IX as promptly as possible after the discovery thereof.  BUYER’s notice shall describe the nature and ascertainable extent of the defects and the place at which the DRILLSHIP can be made available for earliest inspection by or on behalf of the BUILDER.

2.    Interest and Charges:
If BUYER shall be in default of payment of any PAYMENT MILESTONE as provided in Article XI.1(a), BUYER shall pay interest on such PAYMENT MILESTONE at the DEFAULT INTEREST RATE from the due date thereof to the date of payment of the full amount including interest to BUILDER.

In such event, BUYER shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by BUILDER by reason of such postponement.
(b)    If any default by BUYER as defined in Article XI.1 (a) or (b) continues for a period of seven (7) days, or if any default by BUYER as defined in Article XI.1(c) or (d) occurs, BUILDER may, at its option, terminate this CONTRACT by giving written notice to such effect to BUYER.

30










of BUILDER’s loss and damage plus any reasonably estimated profit which BUILDER would have been entitled to receive if the DRILLSHIP had been completed and DELIVERED less the purchase price of any portion of the DRILLSHIP that has been utilized on BUILDER’s other projects, but excluding any consequential or special damages.
4.    Sale of DRILLSHIP:

Further, BUILDER shall have the full right and power either to complete or not to complete the DRILLSHIP as it deems fit but in any event shall use its reasonable endeavours to sell the DRILLSHIP (either in its complete or incomplete form) at public or private sale on such terms and conditions as BUILDER may determine without being responsible for any loss or damage.
(b)    In the event of the sale of the DRILLSHIP in its completed state, the proceeds of sale received by BUILDER (the “COMPLETED SALE PROCEEDS”) shall be applied as follows: firstly to payment of all costs and expenses attending such sale and otherwise incurred by BUILDER as a result of BUYER’s default, and secondly to payment of all unpaid PAYMENT MILESTONES and interest on such PAYMENT MILESTONES at the DEFAULT INTEREST RATE from the respective due dates thereof to the date of application (collectively, the “COMPLETED OUTSTANDING AMOUNT”).   In the event the COMPLETED OUTSTANDING AMOUNT exceeds the sum of the COMPLETED SALE PROCEEDS, BUYER shall remit the difference to BUILDER, provided that, in no event shall such difference exceed the CONTRACT PRICE.  In the event the COMPLETED SALE PROCEEDS exceeds the COMPLETED OUTSTANDING AMOUNT, then BUILDER shall remit the difference to BUYER.
(c)    In the event of the sale of the DRILLSHIP in its uncompleted state, the proceeds of sale received by BUILDER (the “INCOMPLETE SALE PROCEEDS”) shall be applied as follows: firstly to payment of all costs and expenses attending such sale and otherwise incurred by BUILDER as a result of BUYER’s default, secondly to payment of all costs of construction of the DRILLSHIP to date of termination of the CONTRACT less the PAYMENT MILESTONE(S) retained by BUILDER pursuant to Article XI.4(a) above and, thirdly to BUILDER’s reasonably estimated profit to which it would have been entitled to receive if the DRILLSHIP had been completed and DELIVERED (collectively, the “INCOMPLETE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT”).  In the event the INCOMPLETE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT exceeds the sum of the INCOMPLETE SALE PROCEEDS plus any previously paid PAYMENT MILESTONES, BUYER shall remit the difference to BUILDER, provided that, in no event shall such difference exceed the CONTRACT PRICE.  In the event the INCOMPLETE SALE PROCEEDS plus any previously paid PAYMENT MILESTONES exceeds the INCOMPLETE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT, then BUILDER shall remit the different to BUYER.

31

Each party agrees that it shall hold in strict confidence and shall not disclose to any PERSON or use any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION (as defined below) from and after the EFFECTIVE DATE through the period ending two (2) years after the DELIVERY DATE.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may, provided that each such PERSON shall be informed of the confidential nature of such information, disclose CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to the officers, directors, employees, representatives, investors, lenders, counsel and other professionals (including potential lenders and investors and their employees, counsel and other professionals) of a party and its AFFILIATES who need to know such information for purposes of (a) executing this CONTRACT and (b) the usual

45










operation, repair and maintenance or upgrades of the DRILLSHIP.  In the event that a party is requested by subpoena, civil investigative demand, or any similar process to disclose any such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, such party will provide the other party with prompt notice of such request, demand or interrogatories so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order.  In the event that a protective order or injunction prohibiting disclosure is not obtained, then such party may furnish only so much of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION as, in the reasonable written opinion of its legal counsel (copy being simultaneously provided to the other party), is required and shall preserve the confidentiality of the remainder in accordance with this Article XXI.8.  Should a party, its AFFILIATES or their agents or representatives disclose or use any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for the direct or indirect benefit or use of themselves or any other PERSON, or otherwise breach this Article XXI.8, any benefits obtained by such party or any such other PERSON shall be held in trust for the sole benefit of the other party.  The parties agree that because an award of money damages (whether pursuant to the foregoing sentence or otherwise) would be inadequate for any breach of this Article XXI.8, any such breach would cause the each party irreparable harm and therefore the non-breaching party shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.
As used herein, “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION” shall mean this CONTRACT and all information (written or digital) relating to BUILDER, BUYER or the negotiation or substance of this CONTRACT and any other ancillary agreements, whether or not marked with any legends or other markings indicating the information to be proprietary or confidential.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not include information to the extent, but only to the extent, disclosure thereof (or the terms and conditions thereof) is required by LAW, information which the disclosing party can demonstrate is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such party or its AFFILIATES and information necessary for a party to enforce its rights under this CONTRACT or defend against indemnification claims under this CONTRACT.  The parties’ obligations under this Article XXI.8 shall survive the termination of this CONTRACT.
9.    Public Announcements:
No press or other public announcement, or public statement or comment in response to any inquiry, relating to the transactions contemplated by this CONTRACT shall be issued or made by either party without consultation with the other party; provided, that a press release or other public announcement, regulatory filing, statement or comment made without such consultation shall not be in violation of this Article XXI.9 if it is made (i) in order to comply with such LAW or stock exchange policies or (ii) to PERSONS holding consent or approval rights that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this CONTRACT.  Furthermore, in all instances, prompt notice from one party to the other shall be given with respect to any such release, announcement, statement or comment.
10.    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act:
BUILDER represents warrants and agrees that it will comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws in any country in which any aspect of this CONTRACT will take place, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”).
BUILDER represents, warrants and agrees that, in connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder, it shall not make any direct or indirect payments, in money or any other item of value (including gifts) or make any offers or promises to pay any money or any other item of value (including gifts) to:

46










(a)    any government or public official;
(b)    any political party;
(c)    any candidate for political office; or
(d)    any other person or entity, with the knowledge that such payment, offer or promise to pay will be made to any government official for the purpose of influencing such government official to obtain or retain business or to make any decisions favorable to BUYER, BUILDER, or both.
BUILDER further represents that no government official is a principal, owner, officer, employee or agent of any entity in which BUILDER has an interest, and no government official has any material financial interest in the business of BUILDER.
BUILDER affirms that BUYER shall have the right to audit BUILDER’s books and records, as warranted, to ensure compliance with this CONTRACT.  These audit rights do not extend beyond the records relating to BUILDER’S performance of this CONTRACT.
In the event of any breach by BUILDER of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this provision, BUYER may, in its sole discretion in addition to any other remedy provided herein or otherwise provided by LAW, immediately terminate this CONTRACT without notice or indemnity and in such event, BUILDER shall forfeit all rights to all fees and commissions which shall accrue and/or have been earned but which have not been paid as of the date of such termination.
11.     COUNTERPARTS:
This CONTRACT may be executed by each of the parties hereto on any number of separate counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this CONTRACT in Portable Document Format (PDF) or by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of an executed original counterpart of this CONTRACT, although the original signature pages shall thereafter be appended to this CONTRACT.

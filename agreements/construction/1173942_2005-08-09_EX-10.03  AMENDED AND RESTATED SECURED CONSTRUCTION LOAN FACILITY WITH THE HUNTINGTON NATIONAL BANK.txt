Agent, the Consultant or their respective agents, employees and designees
shall be solely for Agent's and Lenders' own information and shall not be
deemed to have been made for or on account of Borrower or any other party.
Borrower hereby relieves Agent and Lenders of any and all liability or

Agent a waiver of lien rights executed by such broker and otherwise in a

in the course of any such verification, any amount shown on the contract
entered into for the performance of any portion of the Work (including the
Construction Contract or any Subcontract), or any application for payment,
sworn statement or waiver of lien is subject to a possible discrepancy,
such discrepancy shall be eliminated by Borrower to Agent's reasonable
satisfaction. Each request for disbursement shall be made by a letter from
an authorized agent of Borrower addressed to Agent, specifying in detail
the amount and mode of each disbursement and accompanied by the following,
all in form and substance satisfactory to Agent:

material deviation from the contract amount under the Construction
Contract or any Subcontract or the projected time of completion of any
component of the Work, (C) the total cost to complete the Work, (D)
and that after giving effect to all amounts previously certified for

to complete the Work in accordance with the Plans and Specifications;

(v) Copies of all licenses and permits (including building
permits) necessary for construction and completion of the Work with
respect thereto; and

(vi) Such other documents, assignments, certificates and opinions
as are required by the Title Company, or as may be reasonably required

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the

pursuant to this Agreement until the Title Company is prepared to issue an
endorsement to the Title Policy updating the same to the date of such
disbursement and increasing the amount of coverage (including mechanic's
lien coverage) thereunder by the amount so disbursed, and insuring the lien
of the Deed of Trust to be superior to all defects in title other than the
Permitted Exceptions.

4.4 Certifications; Representations and Warranties. Each request for
disbursement by Borrower shall constitute (a) Borrower's certification that the
representations and warranties contained in Article 5 below are true and correct
in all material respects as of the date of such request, (b) Borrower's
certification that Borrower is in compliance with the conditions contained in
this Article 4, and (c) Borrower's representation and warranty to Agent, with
respect to the Work, materials and other items for which payment is requested
that (i) such Work and materials have been incorporated into the Project, free
and clear of liens and encumbrances, (ii) the value thereof is as estimated
therein, (iii) such Work and materials substantially conform to the Plans and
Specifications, this Agreement and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, and (iv) the requisitioned value of such Work and
materials and the amounts of all
<PAGE>
other items of cost for which payment is requested by Borrower have theretofore
been in fact paid for in cash by Borrower or the same are then due and owing by
Borrower and (unless Agent disburses funds directly to the parties performing
the Work or to the Title Company) will in fact be paid in cash by Borrower
within five days after Borrower's receipt of the requested disbursement. Neither
review nor approval by Agent of requests for disbursement or any information
contained therein or any other information provided to Agent in accordance with
the other provisions of this Article 4 shall constitute the acceptance or
approval by Agent of any portion of the Work or any such information except for
the purpose of making the requested disbursement.

4.5 Costs. For purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation,

shall be deemed to be incurred by Borrower when the labor and material have been

the cost of services (other than labor included in the Work) shall be deemed to
be incurred by Borrower when the services are actually rendered and the payment
therefor is due and payable, (c) real estate taxes, interest and insurance
premiums shall be deemed to be incurred by Borrower when such items become due
and payable, and (d) any other costs shall be deemed to be incurred by Borrower
when the payment therefor is due and payable, but not before the value to be
received in return for such cost has been received by Borrower.

4.6 Development Fees. No proceeds of the Loan will be disbursed for
development fees but project management direct costs and reimbursable expenses
will be paid to HADC as set forth in the Budget.

4.7 Loan In Balance.

(a) At all times prior to the Maturity Date, (i) the undisbursed
proceeds from the Loan together with the undisbursed amount of the
Borrower's Equity and the Subordinate Loan, shall be sufficient to pay all
Project Costs remaining unpaid through the projected date on which the
Improvements will be substantially completed.

(b) If Agent reasonably determines that the undisbursed proceeds from
the Loan together with the undisbursed amount of the Borrower's Equity and
the Subordinate Loan, are insufficient to pay all Project Costs remaining
unpaid through the projected date on which the Improvements will be
substantially completed, then the Loan shall be deemed "out of balance" to
the extent of such excess.

(c) If Agent reasonably deems the Loan to be out of balance as
aforesaid, Borrower shall, within ten days after written request by Agent,
deposit with Agent an amount equal to the excess amount. The sums thus
deposited with Agent will be disbursed by Agent to complete the Work prior
to any further disbursement of proceeds of the Loan (or, if the Work has
been completed, to the repayment of the Principal Balance). If such deposit
is not made within such time, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have
occurred. No interest shall be payable to Agent on such amounts when
disbursed to pay the cost of any Work.
<PAGE>
(d) Borrower shall be entitled to reallocate among line items in the
Budget without obtaining Agent's prior written consent, so long as such
reallocation does not result in an increase in the Project Budget. The
amount allocated to the contingency and the interest reserves line shall,
at all times, be an amount reasonably acceptable to the Agent.

4.8 Application of Disbursements.

(a) Agent shall make each requested disbursement of the Loan to an
account maintained by Borrower with Agent within ten days after all of the
conditions precedent to such disbursement set forth in Section 4.1 above
have been satisfied and all documentation required under Section 4.3 above
has been delivered to Agent.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Agent nor any Lender shall
be responsible, liable or obligated to the contractors, sub-contractors,
suppliers, materialmen, laborers, architects, engineers, or any other
parties, for services or work performed, or for goods delivered by them or
any of them, in and upon the Land or employed directly or indirectly in the
performance of the Work, or for any debts or claims whatsoever accruing in
favor of any such parties and against Borrower or others, or against the
Project. It is expressly understood and agreed that Borrower is not and
shall not be an agent of Agent or Lenders for any purpose whatsoever.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, advances made at Agent's
option, directly to any contractor, subcontractor or supplier of labor or
materials, or any other party, shall not be deemed a recognition by Agent
or any Lender of any third party beneficiary status of any such person or
entity.

(c) Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall receive all Loan
Advances to be made hereunder by Agent as a trust fund and that Borrower
shall withdraw and use said funds solely for the payment of the bills for
the labor and materials used in the performance of the Work for which such
Loan funds were requested by Borrower, and for the payment of the other
items of Project Cost for which such Loan proceeds were requested by
Borrower, and for no other purpose whatsoever; however, nothing herein
shall impose upon Agent any obligation whatsoever to see to the proper
application of any such monies by Borrower.

(d) Whenever so requested by Agent, Borrower shall promptly furnish
Agent written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent that all monies
theretofore advanced by Lenders pursuant to this Agreement have actually
been paid or applied in payment of the cost of performance of the Work and
in payment of the other items of Project Cost for which such funds were
advanced by Lenders, and until such evidence is produced, at the option of
Agent, no future or additional payments or Loan Advances need be made
hereunder.

4.9 Payment of Interest by Agent. Proceeds of the Loan shall be allocated
to an interest reserve (the "Interest Reserve") as set forth in the Budget
approved by Agent. All accrued interest on the Loan shall be paid from the
Interest Reserve until fully disbursed and thereafter from rental income
received by Borrower. Borrower hereby authorizes Agent on the
<PAGE>
first day of each month during the term of the Loan (and on any other date on
which interest is due under the Notes) to disburse to itself for the benefit of
the Lenders from the undisbursed proceeds of the Interest Reserve to pay all
then accrued and unpaid interest on the Loan; provided, however, that such
authorization shall not be deemed to limit, reduce or otherwise affect
Borrower's obligation to pay interest if (a) there are no remaining amounts in
the Interest Reserve, or (b) Agent is entitled to withhold disbursement of the
Interest Reserve for any reason.

collectively referred to as "Proceeds") after deduction of all expenses of
collection and settlement, including attorneys' and adjusters' fees and
charges. Any proceeds remaining after repayment of the indebtedness under
the Loan Documents shall be paid by Agent to Borrower.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.1(a) to the contrary, in the
event of any casualty to the Improvements or any condemnation of part of
the Project, Borrower shall have the option of applying the Proceeds to
restoration of the Improvements if (i) no Event of Default exists, (ii) all
Proceeds are deposited with Agent, (iii) in Agent's reasonable judgment,
the amount of Proceeds available for restoration of the Improvements
(together with undisbursed proceeds of the Loan, if any, allocated for the
<PAGE>
cost of the Construction and any sums or other security acceptable to Agent
deposited with Agent by Borrower for such purpose) is sufficient to pay the
full and complete costs of such restoration, (iv) no leases for space in
the Project will be terminated as a result of such casualty or
condemnation, (v) the cost of restoration exceeds twenty percent (20%) of
the Loan Amount, in Agent's sole determination after completion of
restoration the Loan Amount (as the same may be reduced by Borrower) will
not exceed 75% of the fair market value of the Project, (vi) in Agent's
reasonable determination, the Project can be restored to an architecturally
and economically viable project in compliance with applicable Laws, and
(vii) in Agent's reasonable determination, such restoration is likely to be
completed not later than three months prior to the Maturity Date.

6.2 Borrower's Obligation to Rebuild and Use of Proceeds Therefor. In case
Agent does not elect to apply or does not have the right to apply the Proceeds
to the indebtedness, as provided in Section 6.1 above, Borrower shall:

(a) Proceed with diligence to make settlement with insurers or the
appropriate governmental authorities and cause the Proceeds to be deposited
with Agent;

(b) In the event of any delay in making settlement with insurers or
the appropriate governmental authorities or effecting collection of the
Proceeds, deposit with Agent the full amount required to complete
construction as aforesaid;

(c) In the event the Proceeds and the available proceeds of the Loan
are insufficient to assure the Agent that the Loan will be In Balance,
promptly deposit with Agent any amount necessary to place the Loan in
Balance; and

(d) Promptly proceed with the assumption of construction of the
Improvements, including the repair of all damage resulting from such fire,
condemnation or other cause and restoration to its former condition.

Any request by Borrower for a disbursement by Agent of Proceeds and funds
deposited by Borrower shall be treated by Agent as if such request were for an
advance of the Loan hereunder, and the disbursement thereof shall be conditioned
upon Borrower's compliance with and satisfaction of the same conditions
precedent as would be applicable under this Agreement for an advance of the
Loan.

7. BORROWER'S COVENANTS.

7.1 Manner of Construction. Borrower shall, at its expense, cause the Work
to be diligently and expeditiously carried out, in a good and workmanlike
manner, in accordance with the Plans and Specifications and all applicable laws,
ordinances and regulations. All materials, fixtures, equipment and other
articles used in the construction or equipping of the Project shall comply with
the Plans and Specifications. Subject to Force Majeure, Borrower shall cause the
Improvements to be completed on or before the Completion Date.

7.2 Certificate of Completion. Within thirty days after the Project is
substantially completed, Borrower shall deliver to Agent a certificate of the
Contractor stating that the Project
<PAGE>
has been completed in substantial accordance with the Plans and Specifications
and all applicable laws and regulations.

7.3 Change Orders. Borrower shall not, without the prior written approval
of Agent, make or permit any modification of the Plans and Specifications, or
amend or modify the Construction Contracts, or enter into any change orders or
additional contracts for the performance of any portion of the Work; provided,
however, Borrower shall have the right to enter into one or more amendments,
change orders or additional contracts so long as (i) no Event of Default or
event or circumstance that with the passage of time, the giving of notice, or
both, would constitute an Event of Default, then exists under this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, (ii) such amendment, change order or additional
contract does not involve work of a structural nature or modify the exterior of
the Improvements and does not increase the total Project Cost in excess of
Twenty-Three Million Six Hundred Seventy-Seven Thousand Two Hundred Four Dollars
($23,677,204), and (iii) following the implementation of each such amendment,
change order or additional contract, the amount of the contingency reserve
contained in the Budget shall be an amount reasonably acceptable to the Agent.
As a condition precedent to Agent approving any amendment, change order or
additional contract, or to Borrower entering into any other contract for the
performance of any portion of the Work, Borrower shall, immediately upon request
of Agent and prior to commencing any Work relating to any such amendment, change
order or additional contract, deposit with Lender an amount of money as
reasonably determined by Agent after taking into account the additional costs
and expenses resulting from said amendment, change order, or additional
contract.

7.4 Compliance with Laws. Borrower shall comply or cause compliance with
all applicable building codes, zoning ordinances, environmental protection,
health and safety laws and regulations and other laws and regulations governing
the construction, development, use and operation of the Project and the
development, operation and sale of the Improvements. Evidence of such compliance
shall be submitted to Agent on request.

7.5 Inspection. Borrower shall permit inspection of the Project by Agent,
the Consultant and any other agent or designee of Agent. In addition, upon prior
reasonable notice, Borrower shall permit Agent and/or its agents and designees
access to and the right to inspect, audit and copy all books, records,
contracts, leases and other documents and information relating to Borrower or
the Project. All such books, records and accounts of operations relating to the
Project shall be kept in accordance with sound accounting practices consistently
applied. Borrower shall promptly respond to any inquiry from Agent for
information with respect to the Project which information may be verified by
Agent at Borrower's expense; provided, however, that Agent shall at all times be
entitled to rely upon any statements or representations made by Borrower or any
agent thereof.

7.6 Mechanics' Liens. Borrower shall not permit any mechanics' lien claims
to be filed or otherwise asserted against the Project or against any funds due
any contractor or subcontractor, and Borrower shall promptly (and in any event
within fifteen days after Borrower has received notice of such filing) discharge
or cause to be discharged the same in case of the filing of any claims for lien
or proceedings for the enforcement thereof; provided that in connection with any
such lien or claim which Borrower may in good faith desire to contest, Borrower
may contest the same by appropriate legal proceedings diligently prosecuted, but
only
<PAGE>
if Borrower shall furnish to the Title Company such security or indemnity as the
Title Company requires to induce the Title Company to issue an endorsement to
the Title Policy insuring over the exception created by such lien, and provided
further, that Lenders shall not be required to make any further disbursements of
the Loan until any mechanics' lien claims have been so insured against by the
Title Company.

7.7 Release by Agent. With respect to the matters set forth in Section 7.6
above, if Borrower shall (a) fail promptly to discharge any asserted liens or
claims, or (b) fail promptly to contest asserted liens or claims or to give
security or indemnity in the manner provided in Section 7.6 above, or (c) having
commenced to contest the same, and having given such security or indemnity, fail
to prosecute such contest with diligence, or to maintain such indemnity or
security so required by the Title Company for its full amount, or (d) upon
adverse conclusion of any such contest, fail promptly to cause any judgment or
decree to be satisfied and lien to be released, then Agent may, but shall not be
required to, upon prior written notice to Borrower procure the release and
discharge of any such claim and any judgment or decree thereon and, further,
may, in its sole discretion, effect any settlement or compromise of the same, or
may furnish such security or indemnity to the Title Company, and any amounts so
expended by Agent, including premiums paid or security furnished in connection
with the issuance of any surety company bonds, shall be deemed to constitute
disbursements of the proceeds of the Loan hereunder and shall bear interest from
the date so disbursed until paid at the Default Rate. In settling, compromising
or discharging any claims for lien, Agent shall not be required to inquire into
the validity or amount of any such claim.

7.8 Financial Statements; Reports. During the term of the Loan, Borrower
will furnish to Agent: (i) on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the
end of each calendar quarter commencing upon completion and occupancy of the
Project quarterly operating statements, balance sheets and rent rolls for
Borrower, (ii) within ten (10) days after receipt by Borrower financial
statements for each of the tenants in the Project if Borrower is entitled to
financial statements under the respective tenant lease, and (iii) within thirty
(30) days after the same are filed, copies of the federal tax returns for
Borrower and the Trust, together with copies of all filings by the Trust with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. With respect to financial statements of
tenants in the Project, failure to furnish such financial statements shall not
be an Event of Default hereunder so long as Borrower makes a responsible effort
to do so.

7.9 Affirmation of Representations and Warranties. Borrower agrees that all
representations and warranties of Borrower contained in Article 5 hereof shall
remain true in all material respects at all times until the Loan is repaid in
full.

7.10 Title. Except for (a) the Deed of Trust and other security for the
Loan, and (b) the Permitted Exceptions, Borrower shall keep the title to the
Real Property and the Personal Property free of all liens, claims and
encumbrances, whether senior or junior to or at parity with the Deed of Trust
and such other security, subject, however, to Borrower's right to contest
mechanics' liens provided in Section 7.6 above.

7.11 Proceedings Affecting Property. If any proceedings are filed seeking
to enjoin or otherwise prevent or declare invalid or unlawful the construction,
occupancy, use, maintenance or operation of the Project, or any portion thereof,
Borrower shall cause such proceedings to be
<PAGE>
vigorously contested in good faith, and in the event of an adverse ruling or
decision, prosecute all allowable appeals therefrom, and shall, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, resist the entry or seek the stay of any
temporary or permanent injunction that may be entered, and use its best efforts
to bring about a favorable and speedy disposition of all such proceedings. All
such proceedings, including without limitation, all of Agent's costs, and fees
and disbursements of Agent's counsel in connection with any such proceedings,
whether or not Agent is a party thereto, shall be at Borrower's expense. To the
extent that Agent incurs any such expenses, including attorneys' fees and fees
and charges for court costs, bonds and the like, Borrower shall reimburse Agent
for such expenses and the amount due Agent shall bear interest from the date so
incurred by Agent until repaid to Agent at the Default Rate and shall be payable
to Agent on demand. The foregoing provisions of this Section 7.11 shall not
limit or affect the provisions of Section 10(i) below.

7.12 Disposal and Encumbrance of Property. Except for the Lease and the
Subordinate Loan, Borrower shall not, without the Required Lender's prior
written consent, suffer, permit or enter into any agreement for any sale, lease,
transfer, or in any way encumber or dispose of or grant or suffer any security
or other assignment (collateral or otherwise) of or in all or any portion of the
Project. Any consent given by Agent or deemed to have been given by Agent, or
any waiver of default under this Section 7.12, shall not constitute a consent
to, or waiver of any right, remedy or power of Agent under any subsequent
default hereunder.

7.13 Insurance. Borrower shall obtain and at all times maintain the
insurance required upon the terms of the Deed of Trust. Borrower shall pay all
premiums on all insurance policies required from time to time under this
Agreement, and thirty days prior to expiration of any such policies, Borrower
shall furnish to Agent, with premiums prepaid, additional and renewal policies
in form, and with companies, coverage, deductibles and amounts satisfactory to
Agent. In the event of failure by Borrower to provide such insurance, Agent may,
but shall not be required to, place insurance and treat the amounts expended
therefor as disbursements of Loan proceeds and such amounts from the date so
expended by Agent until repaid to Agent shall bear interest at the Default Rate.
Borrower shall not store materials or supplies on the Project site without first
providing to Agent evidence of insurance covering such materials or supplies, in
form and substance satisfactory to Agent.

7.14 Performance of Obligations; Notice of Default. Borrower shall promptly
and fully perform and comply in all respects with the obligations, terms,
agreements, provisions and requirements of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and all other documents and instruments relating thereto and will not
permit to occur any default or breach hereunder or thereunder. Borrower shall
promptly give to Agent notice of the occurrence of any event which does or would
with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, constitute an Event
of Default, or have any material adverse effect on any security for the Loan or
on Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents or on the Guarantor's ability to perform its
obligations under the Guaranty and the other Loan Documents to which it is a
party.

7.15 Subcontracts. Within ten days after being executed, Borrower shall
deliver to Agent a copy of each Subcontract entered into by the Contractor for
an amount exceeding $500,000.
<PAGE>
7.16 Restrictions Affecting Borrower. Borrower covenants and agrees that,
without the prior written consent of Agent, there shall not occur: (i) any
amendment or modification of the Certificate of Limited Partnership or
Partnership Agreement establishing or governing Borrower, (ii) the release or
discharge of any partner of Borrower, (iii) the admission of any new partner, or
(iv) any change in the beneficial ownership of Borrower which reduces the
interest held by the Trust to less than Fifty-One Percent (51%). Provided,
however, that borrower shall be entitled to offer up to thirty percent (30%) of
the ownership interest in Borrower to tenants in the Project upon such terms
reasonably acceptable to Agent, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

7.17 Use of Receipts. Borrower shall cause all rents and other income and
receipts realized and received by Borrower from and in connection with the
Project during the term of the Loan to be used, first for the purpose of paying
interest on the Loan in accordance with Section 4.9 above, and then for the
actual costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in connection with the ownership,
operation, management and repair of the Project, including without limitation,
operating expenses, real estate taxes and insurance premiums.

7.18 Additional Documents. Borrower shall not record any document
pertaining to the title to the Land without the prior written approval of Agent
of the form and substance of such documents.

8. LOAN EXPENSES. Borrower agrees to pay all of the Loan Expenses. Any Loan
Expenses paid by Agent shall bear interest commencing on the date demand for
repayment thereof is made by Agent until paid at the Default Rate and shall be
paid by Borrower upon demand, or may be paid by Agent at any time by
disbursement of proceeds of the Loan. Any Loan Expenses paid by Agent shall be
reimbursed to Agent by Borrower regardless of whether there shall be any
disbursements of the Loan.

9. AGENT'S REPRESENTATIVES. Agent, at Borrower's expense as identified in the
Budget, shall have the right to engage third party personnel in connection with
negotiation, documentation and administration of the Loan, including without
limitation, the Consultant, to (i) review the Plans and Specifications, (ii)
review Borrower's final construction budget, (iii) conduct monthly inspections
of the Work and report on the progress of construction thereof, (iv) review all
change orders, (v) review applications for disbursements and accompanying
documents, (vi) issue reports and certificates to Agent, (vii) inspect the
structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, HVAC and roof systems constituting
the Work, (viii) determine whether the Work has been completed in accordance
with the Plans and Specifications, and (ix) provide other services as requested
by Agent, and Borrower shall fully cooperate with the Consultant and other
personnel in all reasonable respects in connection therewith.

10. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of any one or more of the following shall
constitute an "Event of Default":

(a) Failure by Borrower or any other obligor to pay any installment of
principal or interest or any other amount payable pursuant to the Notes,
this Agreement, the Indemnity Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
on or before the fifth day after the date when such amount is due and
payable; provided, however, no such five day
<PAGE>
grace period shall be permitted with respect to the final payment of the
Notes due and payable on the Maturity Date.

(b) Failure by Borrower or Guarantor to promptly perform or cause to
be performed any non-monetary obligation or observe any non-monetary
condition, covenant, term, agreement or provision required to be performed
or observed by Borrower or Guarantor under this Agreement, the Notes, the
Deed of Trust, the Indemnity Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;
provided, however, that if such failure by its nature can be cured, then so
long as the continued operation and safety of the Project, and the
priority, validity and enforceability of the lien created by the Deed of
Trust or any of the other Loan Documents and the value of the Project are
not imminently impaired, threatened or jeopardized, then Borrower shall
have a period (the "Cure Period") of thirty (30) days after written notice
from Agent of any such failure of performance or observance to cure or
cause the cure of the same, and an Event of Default shall not be deemed to
exist during the Cure Period, provided further that if Borrower commences
to cure such failure during the Cure Period and is diligently and in good
faith attempting to effect such cure, the Cure Period shall be extended for
thirty additional days, but in no event shall the Cure Period be longer
than sixty (60) days in the aggregate. The foregoing Cure Period is
intended only to apply in circumstances not referred to in any of the other
paragraphs of this Section 10; Borrower's right to a grace or cure period,
if any, with respect to such other circumstances are to be governed by the
provisions of such other paragraphs.

(c) The existence of any material inaccuracy or untruth in any
representation, covenant or warranty contained in this Agreement or any
other Loan Documents, or of any statement or certification as to facts
delivered to Agent by or on behalf of Borrower, Guarantor or any other
applicant for the Loan.

(d) A discontinuance of the construction of the Work for a period of
thirty consecutive business days (unless otherwise approved by Agent),
other than a discontinuance resulting from Force Majeure events (it being
understood that a delay caused by an insufficiency of funds shall not be
deemed to be beyond the control of Borrower), or any delay in the Work,
other than Force Majeure events, the result of which may be, in Agent's
sole judgment, that the Work will not be substantially completed on or
before the Completion Date; provided, however, in no event shall completion
of the Work extend beyond the Maturity Date.

(e) At any time Borrower or Guarantor files a voluntary petition in
bankruptcy, or institutes (by petition, application, answer, consent or
otherwise) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,
composition, readjustment, dissolution, liquidation or similar proceedings
under any present or future federal, state or other statute or law, or
admits in writing his or its inability to pay his or its debts as they
mature, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or seeks
or consents to the appointment of any receiver, trustee or similar officer
for all or any substantial part of its property.
<PAGE>
(f) The commencement of any involuntary petition in bankruptcy against
Borrower or Guarantor or the institution against Borrower or Guarantor of
any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, dissolution,
liquidation or similar proceedings under any present or future federal,
state or other statute or law, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee or
other officer for all or any substantial part of the property of Borrower
or Guarantor which remains undismissed or undischarged for a period of
sixty (60) days.

(g) The disapproval by Agent at any time of any Work for failure to
comply with the Plans and Specifications or any other provisions of this
Agreement, and Borrower's failure to cause the same to be corrected to the
satisfaction of Lender within fifteen business days after the date Borrower

7.16 above.

(i) Failure of Borrower for a period of thirty days after Agent's
demand to procure the reversal, dismissal or disposition to Agent's
satisfaction of any order enjoining or otherwise preventing or declaring
invalid or unlawful the construction, occupancy, maintenance, operation or
use of the Project, or any portion thereof, in the manner required by the
terms of this Agreement, or of any proceedings which could affect the
validity or priority of the lien of the Deed of Trust or any of the other
security for the Loan, or which could materially affect Borrower's ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
or Guarantor's obligations under the Guaranty.

(j) Except as set forth in the Subordinate Loan Documents, the
attachment, seizure, levy upon or taking of possession by any receiver,
custodian or assignee for the benefit of creditors of all or a substantial
part of the property of Borrower or Guarantor which is not stayed or
dismissed within thirty days after the occurrence thereof.

(k) The assignment or attempted assignment of this Agreement by
Borrower without Agent's prior written consent.

11. EXERCISE OF REMEDIES.

11.1 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Agent with the
approval of the Required Lenders (for the benefit of Lenders), in addition to
availing itself of any remedies conferred upon it by law and by the terms of the
Notes, the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents, may pursue any one or
more of the following remedies first, concurrently or successively with each
other and with any other available remedies, it being the intent hereof that
none of such remedies shall be to the exclusion of any others:

(a) Take possession of the Project and complete the Work and do
anything necessary or desirable in Agent's sole judgment to fulfill the
obligations of Borrower hereunder, including either the right to avail
itself of and procure performance of the Construction Contract, any
Subcontracts or any other contract entered into for the performance of all
or any portion of the Work (or any substitute therefor), or to let new or
<PAGE>
additional contracts with the same contractors or subcontractors or others,
and to employ watchmen to protect the Project from injury. Without
restricting the generality of the foregoing and for the purposes aforesaid,
Borrower hereby appoints and constitutes Agent its lawful attorney-in-fact
with full power of substitution (i) to complete the Work in the name of
Borrower; (ii) to use portions of the Loan or other funds which may be
reserved, escrowed or set aside for any purposes hereunder at any time to
complete the Work; (iii) to make changes in the Plans and Specifications
which shall be reasonably necessary or reasonably desirable to complete the
Work; (iv) to retain or employ new general contractors, subcontractors,
architects, engineers and inspectors as shall be required for such
purposes; (v) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims,
which may be liens or security interests or to avoid such bills and claims
becoming liens or security interests against the Project, or as may be
necessary or desirable for the completion of the Work or for the clearance
of title; (vi) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of
Borrower which may be required by any of the Loan Documents; (vii) to
prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the
Work; (viii) to take such action and require such performance as it deems
necessary under any of the bonds to be furnished pursuant to the provisions
hereof and to make settlements and compromises with the surety or sureties
thereunder, and in connection therewith, to execute instruments of release
and satisfaction; it being understood that the foregoing power of attorney
is coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. All sums expended by
Agent pursuant to this Article 11 shall be deemed to have been paid to
Borrower and secured by the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents, and
shall bear interest at the Default Rate until repaid to Agent.

(b) Withhold further disbursements of proceeds of the Loan.

(c) Declare the unpaid indebtedness evidenced by the Notes to be
immediately due and payable.

(d) Exercise any of the rights and remedies contained in this Deed of
Trust and/or any of the other Loan Documents and/or exercise any other
rights and remedies that Agent may have at law or in equity.

(e) Apply the balance of any deposits made with Agent toward the
repayment of the Loan.

12. MISCELLANEOUS.

12.1 Additional Indebtedness. If any advances or payments made by Agent or
Lenders pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with
disbursements of the Loan, shall exceed the aggregate face amount of the Notes,
all such advances and payments shall constitute additional indebtedness secured
by the Deed of Trust and all other security for the Loan, and shall bear
interest at the Default Rate from the date advanced until paid.

12.2 Additional Acts. Borrower shall, upon request, execute and deliver
such further instruments and documents and do such further acts and things as
may be reasonably required to provide to Agent the evidence of and security for
the Loan contemplated by this Agreement.
<PAGE>
12.3 Loan Agreement Governs. In the event of any inconsistency between any
provision of this Agreement and any provision of any other Loan Document, the
provision of this Agreement shall govern; provided, however, that the provisions
of all of the Loan Documents shall be construed as an integrated set of
provisions governing the Loan and, accordingly, shall be interpreted and
construed liberally to give the maximum validity, enforceability and effect to
all of such provisions.

12.4 Additional Advances. If an Event of Default shall occur, Agent may,
but shall not be obligated to, take any and all actions to cure such default,
and all amounts expended in so doing, all Loan Expenses and all other amounts
paid or advanced by Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents, and all other amounts
advanced by Agent in connection with the performance of the Work or preserving
any security for the Loan, shall constitute additional advances of the Loan,
shall be secured by the Deed of Trust and all other security for the Loan, and
shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date advanced until paid.

12.5 Amendment; Waiver; Approval. This Agreement shall not be amended,
modified or supplemented without the written agreement of Borrower and Lenders
at the time of such amendment, modification or supplement. No waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be
effective unless set forth in writing signed by the party making such waiver,
and any such waiver shall be effective only to the extent therein set forth.
Failure by Agent or Lenders to insist upon full and prompt performance of any
provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or to take
action in the event of any breach of any such provision or upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default, shall not constitute a waiver of any rights of Agent or
Lenders, and Agent and Lenders may at any time thereafter exercise all available
rights and remedies with respect to such breach or Event of Default. Receipt by
Agent of any instrument or document shall not constitute or be deemed to be an
approval thereof. Any approvals required under any of the other Loan Documents
must be in writing, signed by Agent (or all of the Lenders, as applicable) and
directed to Borrower.

12.6 Notice. All notices, communications and waivers under this Loan
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be (i) delivered in person or (ii)

damages, claims, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
court costs) of whatever kind or nature which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against Agent or Lenders at any time which relate to or arise from the
performance of the Work, the offer to rent all or any portion of the Project
and/or the ownership, use, operation or maintenance of the Project, including
without limitation, any brokerage commissions or finder's fees asserted by,
through or under Borrower against Agent or Lenders with respect to the making of
the Loan and any damages incurred by Agent or Lenders by reason of the
construction of Borrower and Agent or Lenders as having the relationship of
joint venturers or partners or Borrower or Agent or Lenders being deemed to have
acted as agent for the other, except to the extent such liability, obligation,
loss, damage, claim, cost or expense arises or results directly from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or Lenders, their agents or their
representatives following the date, if any, on which Agent or Lenders become
mortgagee in possession of the Project or if Agent or Lenders do not become
mortgagee in possession of the Project, the date, if any, on which Agent or
Lenders or their nominee acquires title to the Project. To the extent the
provisions of this Section 12.9 are inconsistent with the terms and provisions
of the Deed of Trust, the provisions of the Deed of Trust shall be deemed
controlling.

12.10 Headings. The titles and headings of the articles and paragraphs of
this Agreement have been inserted as a matter of convenience of reference only

12.13 Invalid Provisions. In the event any one or more of the provisions

invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been in the Loan
Documents.

hereunder or provided by law, any indebtedness relating to the Project or its
operation and now or hereafter owing to Borrower by Lenders (including, without

in a prominent location for the first twelve months of the Loan. Lenders

13. ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

13.1 Assignments and Participations.

(a) Each Lender shall have the right to assign, transfer, sell,
negotiate, pledge or otherwise hypothecate this Agreement and any of its
rights and security hereunder and under the other Loan Documents to any
other Eligible Assignee with the prior written consent of the Agent and
with the prior written consent of Borrower, which consent by the Borrower
and the Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
(provided that no consent of Borrower or Agent shall be required if the
Eligible Assignee is also a Lender or of Borrower if an Event of Default
then exists); provided, however, that (i) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to Agent, for its approval and
acceptance, an Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) each such assignment shall
be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement, (iii) unless the Agent and, so
long as no Event of Default exists, Borrower otherwise consent, the
aggregate amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned
pursuant to each such assignment shall in no event be less than Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000) (provided, however, at all times the Agent shall
retain not less than Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000), (iv) the Agent shall
receive from the assigning Lender a processing fee of Three Thousand Five
Hundred Dollars ($3,500), and (v) if the assignment is less than the
assigning Lender's entire interest in the Loan, the assigning Lender must
retain at least Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for any Lender other than
Agent, in Agent's discretion) interest in the Loan.. The Agent may
designate any Eligible Assignee accepting an assignment of a specified
portion of the Loan to be a Co-Agent, an "Arranger" or similar title, but
such designation shall not confer on such Assignee the rights or duties of
the Agent. Upon such execution, delivery, approval and acceptance, and upon
the effective date specified in the applicable Assignment and Acceptance,
(a) the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations
of a Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and Borrower
hereby agrees that all of the rights and remedies of Lenders in connection
with the interest so assigned shall be enforceable against Borrower by an
Eligible Assignee with the same force and effect and to the same extent as
the same would have been enforceable but for such assignment, and (b) the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been assigned
by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and
be released from its obligations hereunder and thereunder.

(b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
assigning Lender thereunder and the Eligible Assignee thereunder confirm to
and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i)
except as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender
makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or
<PAGE>
in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other instrument
or document furnished in connection therewith; (ii) such assigning Lender
makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to the financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or
observance by the Borrower of any of its obligations under any Loan
Document or any other instrument or document furnished in connection
therewith; (iii) such Eligible Assignee confirms that it has received a
copy of this Agreement together with such financial statements, Loan
Documents and other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate
to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into the Assignment
and Acceptance and to become a Lender hereunder; (iv) such Eligible
Assignee will, independently and without reliance upon Agent, the assigning
Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as
it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
Eligible Assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as
the Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof
and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto; and (vi) such Eligible Assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of
this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

(c) Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it and shall record in its records the names
and address of each Lender and the Commitment of, and Percentage of the
Loan owing to, such Lender from time to time. Borrower, the Agent and
Lenders may treat each entity whose name is so recorded as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.

(d) Upon receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee, Agent shall, if such Assignment
and Acceptance has been properly completed and consented to if required
herein, accept such Assignment and Acceptance, and record the information
contained therein in its records, and the Agent shall use its best efforts
to give prompt notice thereof to Borrower (provided that neither the Agent
nor the Lenders shall be liable for any failure to give such notice).

(e) Borrower shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Agent and
each Lender in connection with the assignment of interests under this
Agreement or the sale of participations herein.

(f) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, and
without the need to comply with any of the formal or procedural
requirements of this Agreement, including this Section, any Lender may at
any time and from time to time pledge and assign all or any portion of its
rights under all or any of the Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from
its obligations hereunder. To facilitate any such pledge or assignment, the
Agent shall, at the request of such Lender, enter into a letter agreement
with the Federal Reserve
<PAGE>
Bank in, or substantially in, the form of the exhibit to Appendix C to the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York Operating Circular No. 12.

(g) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, any
Lender may assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to another branch or affiliate of such Lender without first
obtaining the approval of any Agent or the Borrower, provided that (i) such
Lender remains liable hereunder unless the Borrower and Agent shall
otherwise agree, (ii) at the time of such assignment such Lender is not a
Defaulting Lender, (iii) such Lender gives the Agent and Borrower at least
fifteen (15) days prior written notice of any such assignment; (iv) the
parties to each such assignment execute and deliver to Agent an Assignment
and Acceptance in a form acceptable to Agent, and (v) the Agent receives
from the assigning Lender a processing fee of Three Thousand Five Hundred
Dollars ($3,500).

(h) Each Lender shall have the right, without the consent of the
Borrower, to sell participations to one or more Eligible Assignees in or to
all or a portion of its rights and obligations under the Loan and the Loan
Documents; provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement (including without limitation its Commitment to Borrower
hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations (iii) the Borrower, the Agent and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and with regard
to any and all payments to be made under this Agreement and (iv) the holder
of any such participation shall not be entitled to voting rights under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents (but such holder may contract with
the Lender selling such Eligible Assignee its interest in such Lender's
share of the Loan as to voting of such Lender's interest under Section
14.6(b) [but not under any other section of this Agreement], provided that
any such agreement by a Lender shall bind only such Lender alone and not
Borrower, the other Lenders or the Agent).

(i) No Eligible Assignee of any rights and obligations under this
Agreement shall be permitted to subassign such rights and obligations. No
participant in any rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be
permitted to sell subparticipations of such rights and obligations.

(j) Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Lenders may provide to any
Assignee or Participant originals or copies of this Agreement, any other
Loan Document and any other documents, instruments, certificates, opinions,
insurance policies, letters of credit, reports, requisitions and other
materials and information of every nature or description, and may
communicate all oral information, at any time submitted by or on behalf of
Borrower or received by any Lender in connection with the Loan or with
respect to Borrower or Guarantor, provided that prior to any such delivery
or communication, such Eligible Assignees or Participants shall agree to
preserve the confidentiality of any of the foregoing to the same extent
that such Lender agreed to preserve such confidentiality. In order to
facilitate assignments to Eligible Assignees and sales to Eligible
Assignees, Borrower shall execute such further documents, instruments or
agreements as Lenders may reasonably require; provided, that Borrower shall
not be
<PAGE>
required (i) to execute any document or agreement which would materially
decrease its rights, or materially increase its obligations, relative to
those set forth in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
(including financial obligations, personal recourse, representations and
warranties and reporting requirements), or (ii) to expend more than
incidental sums of money or incidental administrative time for which it
does not receive reasonable reimbursement in order to comply with any
requests or requirements of any Lender in connection with such assignment
or sale arrangement. In addition, Borrower agrees to cooperate fully with
Lenders in the exercise of Lenders' rights pursuant to this Section,
including providing such information and documentation regarding Borrower
as any Lender or any potential Eligible Assignee may reasonably request and
to meet with potential Eligible Assignees.

14. APPOINTMENT.

14.1 Appointment.

(a) Huntington is hereby appointed as Agent hereunder and under each
other Loan Document, and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent
to act as agent for each Lender and to take such actions as Lender is
obligated or entitled to take under the provisions of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers as are set forth
herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. Agent agrees to act as such upon the express conditions
contained in this Article in substantially the same manner that it would
act in dealing with a loan held for its own account. Agent shall not have a
fiduciary relationship with respect to any Lender by reason of this
Agreement.

(b) The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the
Agent and the Lenders, and Borrower shall not have any rights to rely on or
enforce any of the provisions hereof except as provided in Section 14.2
below. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, the
Agent shall act solely as agent of Lender and does not assume, and shall
not be deemed to have assumed, any obligations toward or relationship of
agency or trust with or for the Borrower.

14.2 Reliance on Agent. All acts of and communications by the Agent, as
agent for the Lenders, shall be deemed legally conclusive and binding; and
Borrower or any third party (including any court) shall rely on any and all
communications or acts of the Agent with respect to the exercise of any rights
or the granting of any consent, waiver or approval on behalf of a Lender in all
circumstances where an action by such Lender is required or permitted pursuant
to this Agreement or the provisions of any other Loan Document or by applicable
law without the right or necessity of making any inquiry of any individual
Lender as to the authority of Agent with respect to such matter. In no event
shall any of the foregoing limit the rights or obligations of any Lender with
respect to any other Lender pursuant to this Section 14.

14.3 Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the
Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each
thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and may
exercise all other powers of Lender as are not made subject to the consent of
the Required Lenders pursuant to Section 14.6(a) or to the consent of all
Lenders pursuant to Section 14.6(b). The Agent shall not be considered, or be
deemed, a separate agent
<PAGE>
of the Lenders hereunder, but is, and shall be deemed, acting in its contractual
capacity as Agent, exercising such rights and powers under the Loan Documents as
are specifically delegated to the Agent or Agent is otherwise entitled to take
hereunder. Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation
to the Lenders to take any action except any action specifically provided by the
Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

14.4 Disbursements. At least two (2) Business Days (by 11:00 a.m.
Indianapolis, Indiana time) prior to each date a disbursement of the Loan is to
be made hereunder pursuant to this Agreement, the Agent shall notify each Lender
of the proposed disbursement and provide each Lender with a copy of the draw
request. Each Lender shall make available to Agent (or the funding Lender or
entity designated by the Agent), the amount of such Lender's Percentage of such
disbursement (with respect to such Lender, such amount being referred to herein
as an "Advance") in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m.
(Indianapolis, Indiana time) on the date such disbursement is to be made (such
date being referred to herein as a "Funding Date"). Unless the Agent shall have
been notified by any Lender prior to such time for funding in respect of any
Advance that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Agent such
Lender's Advance, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount
available to the Agent and the Agent, in its sole discretion, may, but shall not
be obligated to, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. If such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Agent by such Lender
on or prior to the respective Funding Date, such Lender agrees to pay and
Borrower agrees to repay to Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to Borrower until the date such amount is paid or repaid to Agent, at:

(a) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and
(B) in the case of Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to a
disbursement made on such Funding Date. If such Lender shall pay to Agent
such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such
Lender's Advance, and if both such Lender and Borrower shall have paid and
repaid, respectively, such corresponding amount, Agent shall promptly
return to Borrower such corresponding amount in same day funds.

(b) Requests by the Agent for funding by the Lenders of disbursements
of the Loan will be made by facsimile. Each Lender shall make its Loan
Advance available to the Agent in dollars and in immediately available
funds to such Lender and account as the Agent may designate, not later than
Noon (Indianapolis, Indiana time) on the Funding Date. Nothing in this
Section 14.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender of its obligation
hereunder to make any Advance on any Funding Date, nor shall any Lender be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to perform its obligations
to make any Loan Advance hereunder, and the Commitment of any Lender shall
not be increased or decreased as a result of the failure by any other
Lender to perform its obligation to make any Advances hereunder.

(c) As soon as practical Agent will promptly forward to each Lender
copies of the draw request documents described in Section 4.3 and cause the
Consultant to forward to each Lender a copy of the Consultant's most recent
inspection. Delivery of the draw request documents and the Consultant's
inspection report shall not be a condition to funding any Loan Advance.
<PAGE>
(d) Distribution and Apportionment of Payments. (e) Subject to Section
14.5(b), payments actually received by Agent for the account of the Lenders
shall be paid to them promptly after receipt thereof by Agent, but in any
event within one (1) Business Day, provided that, if any such payments are
not distributed to the Lenders within one Business Day after Agent's
receipt thereof, Agent shall pay to such Lenders interest thereon, at the
rate of interest applicable to such portion of the Loan, from the date of
receipt of such funds by Agent until such funds are paid in immediately
available funds to such Lenders provided such funds are received by Agent
not later than 11:00 A.M. (Indianapolis, Indiana time) on the date of
receipt. All payments of principal and interest in respect of the Loan, all
payments of the fees described in this Agreement (but not in any separate
fee letter except to the extent expressly set forth therein), and all
payments in respect of any other obligations of Borrower under the Loan
Documents shall be allocated among such of Lenders as are entitled thereto,
in proportion of their respective Percentages or otherwise as provided
herein in the other Loan Documents, as the case may be. The Agent shall
distribute to each Lender at its primary address set forth herein, or at
such other address as a Lender may request in writing, such funds as it may
be entitled to receive, provided that the Agent shall in any event not be
bound to inquire into or determine the validity, scope or priority of any
interest or entitlement of any Lender and may suspend all payments and seek
appropriate relief (including without limitation instructions from the
Required Lenders, or all Lenders, as applicable, or an action in the nature
of interpleader) in the event of any doubt or dispute as to any
apportionment or distribution contemplated hereby. The order of priority
herein is set forth solely to determine the rights and priorities of the
Lenders as among themselves and may at any time or from time to time be
changed by the Lenders as they may elect, in writing, without necessity of
notice to or consent of or approval by Borrower. The Commitment Fee, which
Agent acknowledges has been paid by Borrower to Agent will be allocated
among the Lenders as follows:

<TABLE>
<S>               <C>
Huntington   $45,000
LaSalle      $30,375
KeyBank      $37,125
</TABLE>

(e) If a Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") defaults in making any Advance
or paying any other sum payable by it hereunder, such sum together with
interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date such amount was due
until repaid (such sum and interest thereon as aforesaid referred to,
collectively, as the "Lender Default Obligation") shall be payable by the
Defaulting Lender (i) to any Lender(s) which elect, at their sole option
(and with no obligation to do so), to fund the amount which the Defaulting
Lender failed to fund or (ii) to Agent or any other Lender which under the
terms of this Agreement is entitled to reimbursement from the Defaulting
Lender for the amounts advanced or expended. Notwithstanding any provision
hereof to the contrary, until such time as a Defaulting Lender has repaid
the Lender Default Obligation in full, all amounts which would otherwise be
distributed to the Defaulting Lender shall instead be applied first to
repay the Lender Default Obligation (to be applied first to interest at the
Default Rate and then to principal) until the Lender Default Obligation has
been repaid in full (whether by such application or by cure by the
Defaulting Lender), whereupon such Lender shall no
<PAGE>
longer be a Defaulting Lender. Any interest collected from Borrower on
account of principal advanced by any Lender(s) on behalf of a Defaulting
Lender shall be paid to the Lender(s) who made such advance and shall be
credited against the Defaulting Lender's obligation to pay interest on the
amount advanced at the Default Rate. If no other Lender makes an advance a
Defaulting Lender failed to fund, a portion of the indebtedness of Borrower
to the Defaulting Lender equal to the Lender Default Obligation shall be
subordinated to the indebtedness of Borrower to all other Lenders and shall
be paid only after the indebtedness of Borrower to all other Lenders is
paid. The provisions of this Section shall apply and be effective
regardless of whether an Event of Default occurs and is then continuing,
and notwithstanding (i) any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary or (ii) any instruction of Borrower as to its desired application
of payments. No Defaulting Lender shall have the right to vote on matters
which are subject to the consent or approval of Required Lenders or all
Lenders and while any Lender is a Defaulting Lender the requisite
percentage of Lenders which constitutes the Required Lenders shall be
calculated exclusive of the Percentage of the Defaulting Lender. The Agent
shall be entitled to (i) withhold or set off, and to apply to the payment
of the Lender Default Obligation any amounts to be paid to such Defaulting
Lender under this Agreement, and (ii) bring an action or suit against such
Defaulting Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the
Lender Default Obligation and, to the extent such recovery would not fully
compensate the Lenders for the Defaulting Lender's breach of this
Agreement, to collect damages. In addition, the Defaulting Lender shall
indemnify, defend and hold Agent and each of the other Lenders harmless
from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, damages, costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses), plus interest
thereon at the Default Rate, for funds advanced by Agent or any other
Lender on account of the Defaulting Lender or any other damages such
persons may sustain or incur by reason of or as a direct consequence of the
Defaulting Lender's failure or refusal to abide by its obligations under
this Agreement.

(f) At least five Business Days prior to the first date on which
interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any Lender, each
Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of
America, or a state thereof, agrees that it will deliver to the Agent two
duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form 1001
or 4224, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement and the Notes without deduction or
withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Lender which so
delivers a Form 1001 or 4224 further undertakes to deliver the Agent two
additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date
that such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any
event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, and
such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be
reasonably requested by the Agent, in each case certifying that such Lender
is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Notes without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless
an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or
regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which
would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form
with respect to it and such Lender advises the Agent that it is not capable
of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States
federal income tax.
<PAGE>
14.5 Consents and Approvals.

(a) Each of the following shall require the approval or consent of the
Required Lenders (provided, however, in the event KeyBank and LaSalle have
exercised their rights pursuant to Section 14.19(c), Huntington shall be
excluded in the calculation of "Required Lenders"):

(i) The exercise of any rights and remedies under the Loan
Documents following an Event of Default, provided that absent any
direction from the Required Lenders, Agent may exercise any right or
remedy under the Loan Documents as Agent may determine in good faith
to be necessary or appropriate to protect the Lenders or the
collateral securing the Loan;

(ii) Appointment of a successor Agent;

(iii) Approval of Post-Default Plan (as defined in and subject to
Section 14.7(d)); and

(iv) Except as referred to in subsection (b) below, approval of
any amendment or modification of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, or issuance of any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;

(b) Each of the following shall require the approval or consent of all
of the Lenders:

(i) Extension of the Maturity Date (beyond any extension
permitted herein) or forgiveness of all or any portion of the
principal amount of the Loan or any accrued interest thereon, or any
other amendment of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents which
would reduce the interest rate or interest rate options or the rate at
which fees are calculated or forgive any loan fee, or extend the time
of payment of any principal, interest or fees;

(ii) Reduction of the percentage specified in the definition of
Required Lenders;

(iii) Reducing or increasing of the amount of the Loan or any
Lender's Commitment, or change the requirement that each Lender fund
in accordance with its Percentage;

(iv) Release of any lien on any material collateral (except as
Borrower is entitled to under the Loan Documents);

(v) Release of any Guarantor; and

(vi) Amendment of the provisions of this Section 14.
<PAGE>
(c) In addition to the required consents or approvals referred to in
subsections (a) and (b) above, the Agent may at any time request
instructions from the Required Lenders with respect to any actions or
approvals which, by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan
Documents, the Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant without
instructions from any Lenders, and if such instructions are promptly
requested, the Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking
any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability
whatsoever for refraining from taking any action or withholding any
approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have received such
instructions from the Required Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, no
Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against any Agent as a
result of such Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of
the Required Lenders or, where applicable, all Lenders. The Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender at any time that the Required Lenders have
instructed the Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

(d) Each Lender authorizes and directs the Agent to enter into the
Loan Documents other than this Agreement for the benefit of the Lenders.
Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Agent at the direction or
with the consent of the Required Lenders in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and the exercise by the Agent
at the direction or with the consent of the Required Lenders of the powers
set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all
Lenders, except for actions specifically requiring the approval of all
Lenders. All communications from the Agent to the Lenders requesting
Lenders' determination, consent, approval or disapproval (i) shall be given
in the form of a written notice to each Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied
by a description of the matter or item as to which such determination,
approval, consent or disapproval is requested, or shall advise each Lender
where such matter or item may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the
matter or issue to be resolved, (iii) shall include, if reasonably
requested by a Lender and to the extent not previously provided to such
Lender, written materials and a summary of all oral information provided to
the Agent by Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved, and
(iv) shall include the Agent's recommended course of action or
determination in respect thereof. Each Lender shall reply promptly, but in
any event within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the request
therefor from the Agent (the "Lender Reply Period"). Unless a Lender shall
give written notice to the Agent that it objects to the recommendation or
determination of the Agent (together with a written explanation of the
reasons behind such objection) within the Lender Reply Period, such Lender
shall be deemed to have approved of or consented to such recommendation or
determination. With respect to decisions requiring the approval of the
Required Lenders or all Lenders, the Agent shall upon receiving the
required approval or consent follow the course of action or determination
recommended to the Lenders by the Agent or such other course of action
recommended by the Required Lenders.

14.6 Agency Provisions Relating to Collateral.

(a) The Agent is hereby authorized on behalf of all Lenders, without
the necessity of any notice to or further consent from any Lender, at any
time and from time
<PAGE>
to time, to take any action with respect to any collateral for the Loan or
any Loan Document which may be necessary to preserve and maintain such
collateral or to perfect and maintain perfected the liens upon such
collateral granted pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

(b) Except as provided in this Agreement, the Agent shall have no
obligation whatsoever to any Lender or to any other person or entity to
assure that any collateral exists or is owned by Borrower or is cared for,
protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the liens granted
herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or pursuant hereto or thereto
have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected,
protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority.

(c) Should the Agent commence any proceeding or in any way seek to
enforce the Agent's or the Lenders' rights or remedies under the Loan
Documents, irrespective of whether as a result thereof the Agent shall
acquire title to any collateral, each Lender, upon demand therefor from
time to time, shall contribute its share (based on its Percentage) of the
reasonable costs and/or expenses of any such enforcement or acquisition,
including, but not limited to, fees of receivers or trustees, court costs,
title company charges, filing and recording fees, appraisers' fees and fees
and expenses of attorneys to the extent not otherwise reimbursed by
Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender
shall contribute its share (based on its Percentage) of all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by the Agent (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) if the Agent employs counsel for advice or other
representation (whether or not any suit has been or shall be filed) with
respect to any collateral for the Loan or any part thereof, or any of the
Loan Documents, or the attempt to enforce any security interest or lien on
any collateral, or to enforce any rights of the Agent or the Lenders or any
of Borrower's or any other party's obligations under any of the Loan
Documents, but not with respect to any dispute between Agent and any other
Lender(s). It is understood and agreed that in the event the Agent
determines it is necessary to engage counsel for Lender from and after the
occurrence of a Default or Event of Default, said counsel shall be selected
by the Agent and written notice of such selection, together with a copy of
such counsel's engagement letter and fee estimate, shall be delivered to
the Lenders.

(d) In the event that all or any portion of the collateral for the
Loan is acquired by the Agent as the result of the exercise of any remedies
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or is retained in satisfaction
of all or any part of Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents,
title to any such collateral or any portion thereof shall be held in the
name of the Agent or a nominee or subsidiary of Agent, as agent, for the
ratable benefit of the Agent and the Lenders. The Agent shall prepare a
recommended course of action for such collateral (the "Post-Default Plan"),
which shall be subject to the approval of the Required Lenders. The Agent
shall administer the collateral in accordance with the Post-Default Plan,
and upon demand therefor from time to time, each Lender will contribute its
share (based on its Percentage) of all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Agent pursuant to the Post-Default Plan, including without
limitation, any operating losses and all necessary operating reserves. To
the extent there is net operating income from such collateral, the Agent
shall, in accordance with the Post-Default Plan,
<PAGE>
determine the amount and timing of distributions to Lenders. All such
distributions shall be made to Lenders in accordance with their respective
Percentages. In no event shall the provisions of this subsection or the
Post-Default Plan require the Agent or any Lender to take an action which
would cause such Lender to be in violation of any applicable regulatory
requirements. Further, in no event shall the provisions of this subsection
allow the Agent or Required Lenders to take any action that requires the
approval of all the Lenders in accordance with Section 14.6(b) hereof,
unless such approval is obtained.

14.7 Lender Actions Against Borrower or the Collateral. Each Lender agrees
that it will not take any action, nor institute any actions or proceedings,
against Borrower or any other person hereunder or under any other Loan Documents
with respect to exercising claims against the Borrower or rights in any
Collateral without the consent of the Required Lenders. With respect to any
action by the Agent to enforce the rights and remedies of the Agent and Lenders
with respect to the Borrower and any collateral in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, each Lender hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the court in
which such action is maintained.

14.8 Assignment and Participation. No Lender shall be permitted to assign
or sell all or any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to
Borrower or any affiliate of Borrower.

14.9 Ratable Sharing. Subject to Sections 14.4 and 14.5, Lenders agree
among themselves that (i) with respect to all amounts received by them which are
applicable to the payment of the Loan, equitable adjustment will be made so
that, in effect, all such amounts will be shared among them ratably in
accordance with their Percentages, whether received by voluntary payment, by the
exercise of the right of set-off or bankers' lien, by counterclaim or cross
action or by the enforcement of any or all of the Loan Documents or any
collateral and (ii) if any of them shall by voluntary payment or by the exercise
of any right of counterclaim, set-off, bankers' lien or otherwise, receive
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of the Loan held by it which is
greater than its Percentage of the payments on account of the Loan, the one
receiving such excess payment shall purchase, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation (which it shall be deemed to have done
simultaneously upon the receipt of such payment) in such obligations owed to the
others so that all such recoveries with respect to such obligations shall be
applied ratably in accordance with their Percentages; provided, that if all or
part of such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter
recovered from it, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices
paid for such participations shall be returned to that party to the extent
necessary to adjust for such recovery, but without interest except to the extent
the purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection with such
recovery. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from
another Lender pursuant to this Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct
creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.

14.10 General Immunity. Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
agents or employees shall be liable to Borrower or any Lender for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its or their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the absence of gross negligence, the
Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made
by it in good faith pursuant to Section 14.5, and if any such apportionment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have
<PAGE>
been made in error the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due, but
not made, shall be to recover from the recipients of such payments any payment
in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled.

14.11 No Responsibility for Loan, Recitals, etc. Neither Agent nor any of
its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have
any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (i) any statement, warranty or
representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any use of the Loan;
(ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any
party to any Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in
this Agreement, except receipt of items purporting to be the items required to
be delivered to any Agent; or (iv) the validity, effectiveness or genuineness of
any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection
therewith, provided that the foregoing shall not release Agent from liability
for its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

14.12 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any
other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by all the
Lenders (or the Required Lenders, if such action may be directed hereunder by
the Required Lenders), and such instructions and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of Lenders. Each Lender, severally
to the extent of its Percentage, hereby agrees to indemnify Agent against and
hold it harmless from any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur
by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action, provided that the
foregoing shall not release Agent from liability for its gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

14.13 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may undertake any of its
duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable to Lenders,
except as to money or securities received by them or their authorized agents,
for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected
by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to the agency hereby created and its duties
hereunder and under any other Loan Document.

14.14 Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement,
paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and, in respect to legal
matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel may be
an employee of Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not release the Agent
from liability for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Any such counsel
shall be deemed to be acting on behalf of Lender in assisting the Agent with
respect to the Loan, but shall not be precluded from also representing Agent in
any matter in which the interests of Agent and the other Lenders may differ.

14.15 Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. Lenders agree to reimburse
and indemnify Agent ratably in accordance with their Percentage (i) for any
amounts (excluding principal and interest on the Loan and loan fees) not
reimbursed by Borrower for which Agent is entitled to reimbursement under the
Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by Agent on behalf of
Lender, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration
and enforcement of the Loan Documents, if not paid by Borrower, (iii) for any
expenses incurred by Agent on behalf of Lender which may be necessary or
desirable to preserve
<PAGE>
and maintain collateral or to perfect and maintain perfected the liens upon the
collateral granted pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, if
not paid by Borrower, (iv) for any amounts and other expenses incurred by Agent
on behalf of Lender in connection with any default by any Lender hereunder or
under the other Loan Documents, if not paid by such Lender, and (v) for any
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection
therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby, or the enforcement of any of
the terms thereof or of any such other documents, provided that no Lender shall
be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall Agent incur costs in accordance with the Section in excess of Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) without the prior approval of the Lenders.

14.16 Rights as a Lender. With respect to its Commitment, if any, Agent
shall have the same rights, powers and obligations hereunder and under any other
Loan Document as any Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it
were not an Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include Agent in its individual capacities. The Borrower
and each Lender acknowledge and agree that Agent and/or its affiliates may
accept deposits from, lend money to, hold other investments in, and generally
engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction or have other
relationships, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, with Borrower or any of its affiliates in which Borrower or such
affiliate is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other person.

14.17 Lenders' Credit Decisions. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements and other information prepared by Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.

14.18 Notice of Events of Default. Should Agent receive any written notice
of the occurrence of a default or Event of Default, or should the Agent send
Borrower a notice of Default or Event of Default, the Agent shall promptly
furnish a copy thereof to each Lender.

14.19 Successor Agent.

(a) Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions and
duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Lenders and Borrower. Such resignation shall take effect
on the date set forth in such notice or as otherwise provided below. Such
resignation by Agent as agent shall not affect its obligations hereunder,
if any, as a Lender.
<PAGE>
(b) Upon resignation by the Agent (or removal thereof), or any
successor Agent, the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent with
the consent of Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (provided that no consent of Borrower shall be
required if the successor Agent is also a Lender or if an Event of Default
then exists). If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty
(30) days after the retiring Agent's giving notice of resignation, then the
retiring Agent may appoint a successor Agent with the consent of Borrower,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (provided
that no consent of Borrower shall be required if the successor Agent is
also a Lender or if an Event of Default then exists). Upon the acceptance
of any appointment as an Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Agent and the Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents other than its liability, if
any, for duties and obligations accrued prior to its retirement. After any
retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this
Article 14 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as an Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

(c) After an Event of Default, LaSalle and KeyBank (acting
collectively) shall have the right to remove Agent, as agent, by giving
written notice to Agent whereupon LaSalle shall be appointed as the "Agent"
on behalf of the Lenders. Such removal of Agent as agent shall not affect
its obligations hereunder, if any, as a Lender.

THE FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO AND SUPERSEDE ANY AND ALL
PRIOR COMMITMENTS, AGREEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING, WHETHER

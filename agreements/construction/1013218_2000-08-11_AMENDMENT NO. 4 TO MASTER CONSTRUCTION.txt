(c) If the Company fails to satisfy the ratio set forth in
section 9.10(a) for any Testing Period but does satisfy the ratio set
forth in section 9.10(b) for such Testing Period, then such failure

Liquidity Event resulting in net cash proceeds which, if added to and
considered to be part of Consolidated EBITDAR for such Testing Period
would result in the ratio required by section 9.10(a) being complied

thereof and provides evidence of the occurrence thereof in reasonable
detail (including; without limitation, a written description of the
information provided to the Board of Directors of the Company with

reasonable detail of the ratio set forth in section 9.10(a) which gives
effect to the net cash proceeds received from such Qualifying Liquidity
Event, together with the Carry-Over QLE Credit, if any, and (ii) the
Administrative Agent confirms its belief that there is a sufficient
Carry-Over QLE Credit and/or a Qualifying Liquidity Event has occurred
and that the Company's computations support the conclusion that no
Event of Default occurred by virtue of this section 9.10(c) and so
notifies the parties hereto (which notice the Administrative Agent
shall issue promptly upon confirmation of such conditions).

(d) If on a single occasion during any single fiscal quarter
ended after March 31, 2000, the Company incurs non-recurring losses or
charges related to the reduction or elimination of overhead or other
costs, charges or expenses in connection with a restructuring of the
Company's stock option program, THEN notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in computing Consolidated EBITDAR
for any Testing Period which includes such fiscal quarter, for purposes
of sections 9.10(a) and (b) only, the aggregate amount of such
non-recurring cash losses and charges, up to a maximum of $2,500,000,

anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in computing
Consolidated EBITDAR for any Testing Period which includes such fiscal
quarter, for purposes of sections 9.10(a) and (b) only, the aggregate
amount of such advances shall be an addition to and considered part of
Consolidated EBITDAR.

to the Lenders, under cover dated May 5, 2000, financial projections prepared by

statement for its fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2002

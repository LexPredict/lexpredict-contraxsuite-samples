79. Acceleration Cost Compensation
Location: Chinese Restaurant G/F Grids A-H/1-4
The original design intent and interior finishes were based upon the Wynn Las Vegas Chinese Restaurant. Subsequently, the Owner gave direction that the Wynn Las Vegas design was not to be implemented and requested that an entirely fresh
design approach be adopted for this restaurant.
The revised design documentation was issued in September 2005 and the Contractor can now
progress shop drawings, materials procurement and construction. These works are behind schedule and will jeopardize the Contractor’s ability and opportunity to achieve the Original Project Early Completion.
Therefore, the Owner directs the allocation of additional monies to compensate for overtime works so as to enable the Contractor to recover the Chinese
Restaurant schedule and to further provide the Contractor the opportunity to achieve the Original Project Early Completion.
Location: Spa
and Health Club, First Floor Grids P- V/ 6 -14
The original design intent and interior finishes were intended to reflect the Wynn Las Vegas
Image. The initial Interior Designers were unable to satisfy the design brief and a new design to produce space and circulation plans was implemented in November 2004. The new design has progressed through several revisions and revised design
documentation will be issued progressively during October 2005. The Contractor can now progress shop drawings, materials procurement and construction. These works are behind schedule and will jeopardize the Contractor’s ability and opportunity
to achieve the Original Project Early Completion.

Therefore, the Owner directs the allocation of additional monies to compensate for overtime works so as
to enable the Contractor to recover the Chinese Restaurant schedule and to further provide the Contractor the opportunity to achieve the Original Project Early Completion.
Location: Lobby Lounge: Ground Floor, N – R/ 9 -12
The original design intent and interior finishes
were intended to reflect the Wynn Las Vegas lobby lounge finishes. The initial design did not reflect the desired public and back of house circulation requirements. Furthermore, the perimeter walls were reconfigured to accommodate a rear entry to
the public bathrooms along the ground floor promenade.
The circulation spaces, seating plan and cross over nodes were re-configured. CRF
206 (dated 7 November) introduced changes to the green room, beverage bar and stage areas.
The above re-design requires demolition of
existing walls, building of new walls and relocation of M&E services.
Therefore, the Owner directs the allocation of additional monies
to compensate for overtime works so as to enable the Contractor to recover the Chinese Restaurant schedule and to further provide the Contractor the opportunity to achieve the Original Project Early Completion.
Location: Casino Lounge, Ground Floor Grids B.5 – D.5/ 4 – 5.3
The original design intent and interior finishes were intended to reflect the Wynn Las Vegas casino lounge.
Subsequently, the design of the adjoining Chinese Restaurant was removed from Cleo’s scope and issued to HBA. The restaurant was given an exclusive entry from the exterior façade which affected circulation to the adjacent spaces
including the casino lounge. It was during this period that the design of the casino lounge was further developed requiring concept approval from WDD to include a stand up bar and incorporation of a permanent stage. This final design was issued on
26 October 2005. The above change option was issued under CRF 117.
Therefore, the Owner directs the allocation of additional monies to
compensate for overtime works so as to enable the Contractor to recover the Chinese Restaurant schedule and to further provide the Contractor the opportunity to achieve the Original Project Early Completion.
Increase to the Guaranteed Maximum Price: HK$ 4,000,000/ USD 512,821

The Company has been exploring the possibility of expanding its operations to include the purchase and installation of solar energy systems.  We are currently negotiating with a San Diego, California based privately-held solar energy company for the purchase of a 300MW solar equipment installation contract pipeline (the “pipeline”) for homes, businesses and governmental organizations.  For purposes of the purchase, the parties estimate the value of the pipeline at $3 million.  We intend to purchase the pipeline with shares of our common stock.





Subsequent to purchasing the pipeline, we intend to hire a team of individuals who have experience with solar energy installation and solar equipment purchasing.





Our President is in the process of negotiating the final terms of a definitive asset purchase agreement, which he expects to be finalized before January 15, 2016.  The Company anticipates that this new business opportunity will be beneficial to its shareholders.

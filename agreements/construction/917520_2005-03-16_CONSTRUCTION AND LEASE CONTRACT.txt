so that in the event hereafter of a transfer of the title to the Premises,
whether any such transfer be voluntary or by operation of law or otherwise, the

Insurance shall include Landlord and its agents, officers, directors and
employees as additional insures, and said policy shall include a "fire
legal liability" endorsement;

(b) property insurance with "All Risk" coverage, for one hundred
percent (100%) real property replacement cost, including foundations, with
an extended coverage endorsement, which names Landlord as beneficiary in
case of loss. This insurance shall include coverage for fire, hurricanes,
floods, earthquakes and other events of a similar nature, vandalism and
malicious mischief, boilers and machinery (if applicable) in building
format and content, including all changes, alterations, extensions and
improvements made by Tenant to the Leased Premises;

(c) pollution liability if required by Landlord because of the type
of the operations carried on by Tenant; and,

(d) any other insurance over the Leased Premises which provides
adequate coverage for those insurable risks that are common for property
similar to the Leased Premises.

The deductibles of the insurance policies herein required shall be
Tenant's responsibility and should Landlord undertake any repairs after
any loss or damage to the Leased Premises, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord
the deductible payable under the insurance policy, together with any
amount paid by any insurance provider.

Insurance During Construction. During any construction period at the
Leased Premises, including the work to be performed by Tenant described in
Attachment E, if any, Tenant must have in force the following insurance
policies:

(i) "builders risk" insurance which provides coverage for all
improvements that are being constructed, equivalent to one hundred percent
(100%) of their replacement value;

(ii) if the estimated cost of construction is over five thousand
dollars ($5,000), Tenant must, at Tenant's own cost and expense, provide
Landlord with a performance bond from a surety company recognized and

Page 19
<PAGE>

approved by Landlord, or other satisfactory guarantee acceptable to
Landlord, in a sum equal to the estimated cost of said construction to
guarantee completion of any construction within a reasonable time. At
Landlord's option, instead of Tenant's obtention of a separate bond or
guarantee for each project that may be in process at any given time,
Tenant shall provide Landlord with one bond or guarantee that covers all
alterations, changes, additions or improvements and other construction
occurring at the same time; and,

(iii) Workers' Compensation from the State Insurance Fund
Corporation in such coverage amounts as required by law.

Insurance Policy Increase. Tenant will pay any premium increase required
by an insurance company to cover additional risks resulting from any
alteration, change, addition or improvement made by Tenant to the Leased
Premises.

General Requirements. All insurance policies required of Tenant under this
Article XV must comply in form and substance to Landlord's requirements,
and must provide the following: (i) that the insurance coverage may not be
reduced, canceled or not renewed by the insurance company without written
notice to Landlord and Tenant at least sixty (60) days in advance (unless
said cancellation is due to failure to pay premium, in which case notice
must be sent at least thirty (30) days in advance); and (ii) that the
policy shall be immediately renewed by Tenant on or before its expiration
date. Tenant must obtain said policies from insurance companies duly
authorized to do business in Puerto Rico, and acceptable to Landlord. Said
insurance companies shall have a classification of not less than "A" and a
financial rating of "IV" or better, as rated by A.M. Best and Company.

Insurance Certificates. Before the Date of Delivery of Possession Tenant
shall submit to Landlord the policies (or certified copies) of same
required under this Article XV with all the mentioned endorsements, and
certificates of insurance which evidence the required coverage by Sections
15.01 and 15.02 of this Lease Agreement. Tenant expressly recognizes
Landlord's right not to deliver the Leased Premises to Tenant until two
(2) days after the policies (or certified copies) and the insurance
certificates have been submitted to Landlord, as required in this section.

Evidence of Payment; Renewal of Policies. Tenant must deliver to Landlord
satisfactory evidence of payment of the insurance premiums within fifteen
(15) days of the respective renewal dates of the respective policies and
at the same time submit the corresponding insurance certificate or
certified copy of each renewed policy.

Claims. Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in the collection of claims
against the corresponding insurance companies in those cases where
Landlord handles such claims, including the preparation of damage reports
and other documents required to process the claim. In the event Tenant
does not provide said documents, Landlord, as Tenant's agent and
attorney-in-fact, shall, in addition to any other remedy available to
Landlord, execute and submit any evidence of loss and/or any other
document necessary for collection of the claim.

Periodic Reviews. Landlord reserves the right to review and demand
periodically increases in the limits of the coverages required in this
Lease Agreement as results from the effects of inflation.

Penalties. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 22.08, and without
affecting the general terms of the matters stipulated therein, should
Tenant breach its duty to obtain any of the policies required in Article
XV, which as a result renders it necessary for Landlord to obtain said
policies, in addition to reimbursement for the premium paid for said
policies, Tenant shall pay Landlord a sum equal to twelve percent (12%) of
the cost of the policies obtained by Landlord to cover Landlord's
administrative costs.

Waiver of Subrogation. (a) Landlord and Tenant agree that all fire and
extended coverage and other property damage insurance carried by either of
them in relation to the Leased Premises shall be endorsed with a clause
providing that any release from liability or waiver of claim for recovery
from the other party entered into in writing by the insured thereunder
prior to any loss or damage shall not affect the validity of said policy
or the right of the insured to recover thereunder, provided that the
insurer waives all rights of subrogation which such insurer might have
against the other party. Any release or any waiver of claim shall not be
operative in any case where the effect of such release or waiver is to
invalidate any insurance coverage or invalidate the right of the insured
to recover thereunder. Should any waiver of subrogation result in a
premium increase, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days of notice, pay said
increase in order to maintain the effectiveness said release or waiver.

(b) Neither Landlord nor Tenant shall be liable to the other or the
insurance company that provided the coverage for any loss or damage to any
building or structure of the Leased Premises for the loss of income either
through subrogation or any other form, regardless if such loss or damage
be, in whole or in part, caused by a negligent act or omission of the
other party, its agents, officers, directors or employees, to the extent
that such loss or damage is covered by insurance policy in favor of the
affected party.

<PAGE>

be thereby obligated to pay for such insurance, and if LANDLORD shall demand
that TENANT remedy the condition which cause the increase in the insurance
premiums rate, TENANT will remedy such conditions within five (5) days after
such demand, and (iii) the insurance policies required in the preceding Articles

subrogation against TENANT. All amounts to be reimbursed by TENANT under this
Article, shall be due and payable, as additional rent, with the next installment

be subject to the dispositions of Article THIRTY-SEVEN (37) hereof.

Thirty-three: Additional Dispositions about Insurance - All the Insurance
policies herein required from TENANT, shall be taken in form and substance

next installment of rent. In the event that TENANT fails to make this payment
when due, it shall be subject to the dispositions of Article THIRTY-SEVEN (37)
hereof. It is expressly agreed and understood, that payment by LANDLORD of any
such premiums shall not be deemed to waive or release the default in the payment
thereof by TENANT nor the right of LANDLORD to take such action as may be
available hereunder as in the case of default in the payment of rent.

Upon the commencement of the term hereof, TENANT shall pay to LANDLORD the
apportioned unearned premiums on all such policies of insurance then carried by
LANDLORD in respect of the Premises in the event TENANT continues with the
insurance policies placed in LANDLORD.

TENANT shall not violate nor permit to be violated any of the conditions
or provisions of any of said policies, and TENANT shall so perform and satisfy
the requirements of the companies writing such policies that at all times

execute, acknowledge and deliver any such instrument, LANDLORD, in addition to
any other remedies, may as the agent or attorney-in-fact of TENANT, execute and
deliver any proof of loss or any other instruments as may seem desirable to

Page 23
<PAGE>

LANDLORD and any mortgagee for the collection of such insurance monies. This
shall not be interpreted as any waiver of the obligations of TENANT under
Articles THIRTY, THIRTY-ONE, THIRTY-TWO and THIRTY-THREE hereof or exclusively
in favor of LANDLORD under Article THIRTY NINE hereof.

Thirty-four: Waivers - The receipt by LANDLORD of the rent, additional
rent, or any other sum or charges payable by TENANT with or without knowledge of
the breach of any covenant of this Contact, shall not be deemed a waiver of such
breach. No act or omission of LANDLORD or its agent during the term of this
Lease shall be deemed an acceptance of a surrender of the Premises and no
agreement to accept a surrender of the Premises shall be valid unless it be made
in writing and subscribed by LANDLORD. This Contract contains all the agreements
and conditions made between the parties hereto with respect to the Premises and
it cannot be changed orally. Any additions to, or charges in this Lease must be
in writing, signed by the party to be charged.

Failure on the part of LANDLORD to act or complain of any action or
nonaction on the part of TENANT shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any of its
respective rights hereunder nor constitute a waiver at any subsequent time of
the same provision. The consent or approval by LANDLORD to, or of any action by
the other requiring consent or approval, shall not be deemed to waive or render
unnecessary the consent or approval by LANDLORD of any subsequent similar act.

Thirty-five: Reinstatement - No receipt of monies by LANDLORD for TENANT
after the termination or cancellation hereof in any lawful manner shall
reinstate, continue or extend the term hereof, or affect any notice theretofore
given to TENANT, or operate as a waiver of the right of LANDLORD to enforce the

falling due, or operate as a waiver of the right of by LANDLORD to recover
possession of the Premises proper suit, action, proceeding or remedy; it being

Page 24
<PAGE>

the expiration of the time therein specified, if the default has not been cured
in the meantime, or after the commencement of suit, action or summary
proceedings or of any other remedy, or after a final order, warrant of judgment
of the possession of the Premises, LANDLORD may demand, receive and collect any
monies then due, or hereafter becoming due, without in any manner affecting such
notice, proceeding, suit, action, order, warrant or judgment; and any and all
such monies so collected shall be deemed to be payments for the use and
occupation of the Premises, or at the election of LANDLORD, on account of
TENANT'S liability hereunder. Delivery or acceptance of the keys to the
Premises, or any similar act, by the LANDLORD, or its agents or employees,
during the term hereof, shall not be deemed to be a delivery or an acceptance of
a surrender of the Premises unless LANDLORD shall explicitly consent to it, in
the manner set forth hereinbefore.

Thirty-six: Subordination and Attornment - This Lease is and shall be
subject and subordinate to all liens, or mortgages which may now or hereafter
affect the Premises and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations,
replacements and extensions thereof and, although this subordination provision
shall be deemed for all purposes to be automatic and effective without any
further instrument on the part of TENANT, TENANT shall execute any further
instrument requested by LANDLORD to confirm such subordination.

TENANT further covenants and agrees that it by reason of a default upon
the part of LANDLORD of any mortgage affecting the Premises, the mortgage is
terminated or foreclosed by summary proceedings or otherwise, TENANT will attorn
to the mortgagee or the purchaser in foreclosure proceedings, as the case may
be, and will recognize such mortgage or purchaser, as the TENANT'S landlord
under this Lease. TENANT agrees to execute and deliver, at any time and from

Page 25
<PAGE>

time to time, upon the request of LANDLORD or of the mortgagee or the purchaser
in foreclosure proceedings, as the case may be, any reasonable instrument which
may be necessary or appropriate to evidence such attornment. TENANT further
waives the provision of any statute or rule of law now or hereafter in effect
which may give or purport to give TENANT any right of election to terminate this
lease or to surrender possession of the Premises demised hereby in the event any
such proceeding is brought by the holder of any such mortgage, and TENANT'S
obligations hereunder shall not be affected in any way whatsoever by any such
proceeding.

TENANT, covenants and agrees, upon demand of the holder of any mortgage
duly recorded or recordable in the corresponding Registry of the Property or of
any receiver duly appointed by the foreclose any such mortgage, to pay to the
holder of any such mortgage or to such receiver, as the case may be, all rent
becoming due under this Lease after such demand, provided such holder of any
such mortgage or any such receiver complies with the obligations of LANDLORD
under this Lease.

TENANT, upon request of LANDLORD or any holder of any mortgage or lien
affecting the Premises, shall from time to time, deliver or cause to be
delivered to LANDLORD or such lien holder or mortgagee, within ten (10) working
days from date of demand a certificate duly executed and acknowledged in form

LANDLORD as additional rent, interest on such lately paid or unpaid rents,
additional rent, and/or on such other payments of money required to be paid,
and/or on any such amounts of money required to be refunded, from and after the
date when payment thereof matured or became due and payable, until full payment,
at the rate of twelve (12%) per cent per annum, or if such 12% interest, is
unlawful, then and in such event, at the highest maximum prevailing rate of
interest on commercial unsecured loans as fixed by the Board of Regulatory Rates
of Interest and Financial Charges, created under Law #1, approved October 15,
1973 (10 LPRA 998), as amended, or by any successor statute or regulation
thereof.

Thirty-eight: Abatement - If any substantial service or facility to be
provided by LANDLORD is unavailable for a period exceeding thirty (30) days and
LANDLORD has been notified of the same, should time unavailability of such
service render all or any portion of the Premises untenable, TENANT after the
aforesaid thirty (30) days, shall be entitled to an abatement of a portion of
the rent that shall reflect that portion of the Premises which is untenable,

furnishings or other personal property which TENANT may have placed or installed
or which it may be entitled or required to remove from the Premises. LANDLORD
shall proceed with due diligence to obtain the corresponding insurance
adjustment of the loss and TENANT shall fully cooperate with LANDLORD and assist
in the adjustment of the loss. Until such repairs are completed, and provided

default under or breach of this Lease on the part of TENANT, LANDLORD, at its
option, but without assuming any obligation to do so in any case, may at any
time, and from time to time, relet the Premises or any part or parts thereof for
the account of TENANT or otherwise on such terms as LANDLORD may elect,

as the case may be, and thereafter TENANT covenants and agrees, to pay to
LANDLORD until the end of the term of this Lease as originally demised the
equivalent of any deficiency amount of all the rent reserved herein, less the
net avails of reletting, if any, as specified hereinabove in this Article and

is to say, TENANT shall pay to LANDLORD the amount of any deficiency then
existing.

performance of the same shall be repaid by TENANT on demand. In the event of a
breach or threatened breach by TENANT or any subtenant or other person holding
or claiming under TENANT of any of the covenants, conditions or provisions
hereof, LANDLORD shall have the right of injunction to restrain the same, and
the right to invoke any remedy allowed by law or in equity as if specific
remedies, indemnity or reimbursement were not herein provided for. The rights
and remedies given to LANDLORD in this Lease are distinct, separate and
cumulative, and no one of them, whether or not exercised by LANDLORD, shall be
deemed to be a waiver, or an exclusion of any of the others.

Page 33
<PAGE>

Forty-two: Notice if Default - Anything in this Lease to the contrary
notwithstanding, it is specifically agreed that there shall be no enforceable
default against LANDLORD under any provisions of this Lease, unless notice of
such default be given by TENANT to LANDLORD in which TENANT shall specify the
default or omission complained of, and LANDLORD shall have thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice in which to remedy such default, or if said default
or omission shall be of such a nature that the same cannot be cured within said
period, then the same shall not be an enforceable default if LANDLORD shall have
commenced taking the necessary steps to cure or remedy said default within the
said thirty (30) days and diligently proceeds with the correction thereof.

LANDLORD within ninety (90) days after the expiration of each fiscal year of
TENANT, an annual statement certified by an independent Certified Public
Accountant showing as of the end of each such fiscal year: (i) TENANT'S paid-in

FORTY-THREE hereof, (iii) investment in machinery and its capacity to provide
employment, (iv) taxes (including Social Security taxes) paid, and (v) any other

Page 34
<PAGE>

representatives, its books of accounts and other necessary data and facilities,
all of which shall be provided and made available at TENANT'S principal office

Forty-five: Automatic Renewal - In the event TENANT does not vacate the
Premises in the manner and under the conditions hereinbefore provided, within

the date of the last normal expiration of the term hereof and, in such event,
the parties agree that this Contract shall be held to have been renewed and to
continue in full force and effect for such additional term of five (5) years
upon the mere mailing of such notice by LANDLORD to TENANT. This provision shall
in no way prejudice, affect or deny any right which LANDLORD may otherwise have
because, or at the time, of any such termination of the term hereof,
particularly whenever LANDLORD does not exercise such option; it being agreed

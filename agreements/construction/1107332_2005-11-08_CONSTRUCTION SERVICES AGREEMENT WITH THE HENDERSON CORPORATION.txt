Completion Date (“Final Completion Date”), in each case as set forth in the Progress Schedule, subject to adjustments as hereinafter provided, including Contemplated Delays (as defined in Section 6.02 hereof).

The Work shall be deemed substantially completed (“Substantial

items (as such term is defined in Section 7.02(cc) hereof), if any, remain incomplete provided they do not interfere with such use and occupancy and (c) a temporary certificate of occupancy shall have been issued by the appropriate local

(a) all Work, including all items set forth on the Punch Lists
(as defined in Section 7.02(cc)), has been fully and satisfactorily completed in a good and workmanlike manner, in conformance with the Contract Documents and in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules, requirements and regulations of

(b) all final certificates of approval relating to the Work, including a Final Certificate of Occupancy of the entire Work and the contemplated uses of the Project, including, without limitation, all necessary certifications of any entity

beyond Contractor’s reasonable control; and

(c) all
required receipts, releases of liens, affidavits, waivers, guarantees, warranties, bonds, as-built drawings and any other documents required under this Agreement or the Trade Contractors shall have been issued and delivered to Owner.

is actually hindered or delayed thereby, any Substantial Completion Date or the Final Completion Date, as the case may be, shall be postponed by the actual number of days attributable to each such demonstrated cause. For purposes of this Agreement,
“Contemplated Delays” (a) shall be deemed to include delays or hindrances caused by (i) the acts or



10









omissions of Owner and Architect (including Change Orders providing for an extension of time and suspensions of work pursuant to Article XXII below), as well
as (ii) strikes, (iii) fire, (iv) acts of God, (v) acts of the public enemy, (vi) unavailability of, or inability to obtain, labor or materials by reason of shortages which affect the supply or availability of labor or

each Contemplated Delay, the date or dates upon which each cause of delay began (and ended), the number of days of delay attributable to each such cause, and the action taken, or to be taken, by Contractor to minimize the period of delay if

whether for labor or materials or both, a provision entitling Contractor to terminate or cancel such Trade Contract in the event of a breach thereby by the Trade Contractor or any other occurrence or omission thereunder which would result in a delay
in, or hindrance to, the timely progress of the Work.

6.04
Contractor shall notify Owner promptly if the Work will not be completed within the time provided for in the Project Schedule. If Contractor so notifies Owner, or if, in the opinion of Owner reasonably exercised, Contractor falls behind in the
Project Schedule for any reason other than a Contemplated Delay, Contractor shall take appropriate action to improve the progress of the Work and shall, if requested by Owner, submit operational plans to demonstrate the manner in which the lost time
may be regained if possible.

6.05 On or before the Substantial

liquid waste in full compliance with all applicable environmental laws, shall remove all tools, construction equipment, machinery and surplus materials, and shall maintain the Project free of such items (attributable to Contractor’s work) until
Final Completion. In addition, on or before the Substantial Completion Date, Contractor shall clean, or cause to be cleaned in broom clean condition the Project, as provided in the Construction Documents. If the Project or the Project site are
injured or damaged by Contractor, in the course of Contractor’s cleaning or removal, Contractor, without increase to the Guaranteed Maximum Price, promptly shall repair and restore the portion thereof so damaged or injured to its condition
immediately prior to such damage or injury in a manner satisfactory to Owner



11









and Architect. If Contractor fails to undertake or cause the undertaking of the aforesaid cleaning, removal and repairs, in such event, the Owner may, at
Owner’s sole option, avail itself of any of the remedies provided in this Agreement and, subject to giving 48 hours’ prior written notice to Contractor, Owner may also perform, or cause to be performed, the aforesaid cleaning, removal and
repairs and, in such event, all additional expenses incurred by Owner in connection therewith, at Owner’s option, shall be reimbursed to Owner either (a) by Owner not paying Contractor monies then due or next becoming due from Owner to
Contractor hereunder, or (b) by Contractor paying such amounts to Owner on demand, after rendition of a bill or statement therefor.

6.06 Prior to Substantial Completion of the Work, Owner or Owner’s designees shall have the right to use or occupy all or any portion of the Project
or to install or cause the installation of furniture, furnishings and equipment therein, or to allow other contractors to perform tenant work, provided that such occupancy shall not materially interfere with Contractor’s performance of its
obligations hereunder (including harmonious labor relations) and, provided further, that Owner or Owner’s designees, as the case may be, shall be liable for any delay, or personal injuries to, or death of, any person and for property damage, to
the extent the same is caused by the acts or omissions of Owner or Owner’s designees, as the case may be, in connection with their aforesaid use or occupancy of the Project. Such use or occupancy by Owner or Owner’s designees shall not
(a) constitute acceptance by Owner of any element of the Work or the space, systems, materials or equipment incorporated in the Project, (b) be construed as a waiver of any right or claim by Owner in connection with any Work, or
(c) affect the obligations of Contractor or any Trade Contractor for any Work which is not in accordance with this Agreement, the respective Trade Contracts or the Contract Documents. Contractor shall continue performance of the Work in a
manner which shall not unreasonably interfere with the aforesaid use, occupancy and operation by Owner or Owner’s designees. Contractor agrees that it shall not unreasonably interfere with, or object to, such use or occupancy by Owner or

be accompanied by such documents (including written releases of lien from Contractor and/or Trade Contractors) as Owner may require to evidence that title to the equipment or materials incorporated, in the Project, or pre-purchased as provided in
Article XXI hereof, is unencumbered;

(b) Each Application for
Payment shall constitute a representation by Contractor that to the best of Contractor’s knowledge, information and belief: (i) the partial payment then requested to be disbursed has been incurred by Contractor on account of the Work or is
justly due to Trade Contractors on account thereof, (ii) the materials, supplies and equipment for which such Application for Payment is being submitted have been installed or incorporated in the Project, or have been stored at the Project Site
or at such off-Project Site storage locations as shall have been allowed by Owner hereunder; (iii) the materials, supplies and equipment are not subject to any liens or encumbrances, (iv) no mechanic’s, laborer’s, vendors,

Conditions Work Items pursuant to Trade Contracts) with input by Architect, and the Contractor’s Fee and General Conditions without any retention. (With approval from Owner, Contractor may release Trade Contractor retention on a trade by trade
basis upon final completion of a given Trade’s work.) Contractor shall process and make payments for all obligations to Trade Contractors which are covered by the Application for Payment so paid by Owner within five working (5) days of
receipt of payment from Owner. This provision is strictly for the benefit of Owner in order that satisfactory morale and relations with Trade Contractors be maintained and shall not under any circumstances confer any right upon any third party. This
provision shall be waivable by Owner, in writing, in its absolute discretion;

(d) Within thirty (30) days following Substantial Completion of any portion of the Work and submission of an Application for Payment therefor by Contractor, Owner shall pay to Contractor an amount equal to the
balance remaining unpaid, less retention as set forth in Article 3.07 or, at Owner’s election, such lesser amount with respect to any Trade Contract as Owner may determine, necessary to complete Punch List items and replace defective work. Said
Application for Payment shall also be accompanied (i) by written releases, executed by each Trade Contractor receiving final payment under their respective Trade Contracts, waiving their right to file any mechanic’s, vendors,
laborer’s, materialman’s or other liens against the Project, and (ii) by such other certificates, as-built drawings, maintenance manuals, operating instructions, permits and other documents or instruments required to be delivered to
Owner at Final Completion of the Work under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that if, at any time after any of the hold-back with respect to a particular Trade Contract is released, any lien or

such lien within thirty (30) days, shall be entitled either (x) to hold back from the sums then due or next becoming due to said Contractor an amount equal to all costs and expenses to be incurred in causing such lien or claim to be
discharged of record, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and disbursements, or (y) to require that Contractor immediately discharge the same of record, at its sole cost and expense, except as provided in Section 4.01(h),
by payment, bonding or otherwise, or (z) to require that Contractor pay to Owner, on demand, the amount necessary to cause such lien or claim to be discharged of record, together with all costs and expenses incurred by Owner in connection
therewith, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and disbursements;

Reimbursable Costs and the Contractor’s Fee and General Conditions Costs, the balance of any amounts held back under each Trade Contract. In addition, upon review and confirmation that Contractor has not exceeded the GMP, Owner shall pay to
Contractor Contractor’s GMP Compliance Fee. The acceptance by Contractor of final payment following Final

Completion of the Work shall constitute a waiver of all those claims of which Contractor had knowledge unless the same is set forth in writing and identified
by Contractor in the final Application for Payment as unsettled at the time of Final Completion; any claim so identified in the final Application for Payment shall survive only for a period of one (1) year, as set forth in Article XXIX hereof;
and

(f) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, Owner, in its judgment reasonably exercised, may withhold from any payment due or to become due to Contractor any amount which Owner, in its good faith opinion, deems sufficient to reimburse Owner for its expenditures for the
account of Contractor and to secure Owner’s remedies in consequence of any default or breach by Contractor under this Agreement.

11.02 No payment by Owner (other than Final Payment) of any Application for Payment shall constitute acceptance by Owner of Work completed or material
stored, and no such payment shall be construed as a waiver of any right or claim by Owner in connection with such Work or stored material.

ARTICLE XII
Assignment


12.01 Contractor shall not assign this Agreement or
the performance of all or any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Owner, which consent may be given or withheld in Owner’s sole and exclusive discretion. The provisions of this Section 12.01 may not be waived
or otherwise modified except by a written instrument executed by Owner.

assignee or other may, among other things, use the Contract Documents without payment of any additional fees or charges and may enforce the obligations of Contractor hereunder with the same force and effect as if approved assignee assumes the
obligations and liabilities of Owner. Upon such assignment and assumption by the assignee, Owner shall be released from all of its payment and other obligations and liabilities hereunder. Contractor shall certify, in the form reasonably required by
any such assignee, that the undertakings contained herein as to the obligations in favor of such assignee or other approved assignee shall run in favor of such assignee.

of any of the events set forth in subsection (a) of this Section 14.01, Owner shall have the right, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to complete or cause the Work to be completed, by such means, and in such manner, by contract
or otherwise, as Owner reasonably deems advisable, subject, however, to the terms and conditions of the payment and performance bonds required of Contractor hereunder; and

(v) to the extent required by Owner and subject to the prior written approval of Owner, settle all
outstanding liabilities and all claims arising out of such termination of Trade Contracts, which approval by Owner shall be final for all the purposes of this Section 14.02; provided, however, that in the event of a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to the provisions of this Section 14.02, no Trade Contractor shall be entitled to recover anticipated profits on account of Work unperformed, nor for reimbursement for losses arising out of matters covered by insurance, but
shall be limited to recovering only the reasonable and actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Trade Contractor for Work satisfactorily performed or materials, supplies and equipment procured, ordered, fabricated, incorporated or
installed in the Project (plus overhead and profit) prior to the effective date of such termination along with reasonable and verifiable demobilization and closeout expenses;

(vi) if applicable, transfer title to Owner, to the extent not already vested in Owner, and deliver in the
manner, at the times, and to the extent, if any, directed by Owner (x) fabricated or unfabricated parts, Work in progress, completed Work, supplies and other materials and equipment produced as a part of, or acquired in connection with the

possession of Contractor and in which Owner has or may acquire an interest;

(b) In the event of a termination of this Agreement, pursuant to this Section 14.02, Contractor shall be paid by Owner for the actual unpaid Reimbursable Costs and General Conditions Costs incurred by Contractor
in connection with its performance of the Work up to the date of such termination and any reasonable demobilization costs, including costs (and legal expense) associated with closing out of executed contracts and purchase orders, plus the balance of
the Contractor’s Fee and the portion of General Conditions attributable thereto, less any sums properly deductible by Owner under the terms of this Agreement. Contractor agrees that the pendency or existence of any dispute between Contractor

to recover as a Change Order the actual additional costs incurred, plus an equitable time extension.

14.04 If, without good cause, Owner shall fail for a period of ten (10) days after the due date to make payment on any approved Application for
Payment, or if the Work should be stopped (a) for a period in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) days at Owner’s request, or (b) for a period in excess of one hundred and eighty (180) days under an order of any court or
other public authority having jurisdiction over the Work or the Project or as a result of an act of government, such as a declaration of national emergency making materials unavailable through no act or fault of Contractor, then Contractor
immediately shall serve Owner with notice thereof, and, if Owner shall fail (i) to make such payment, as the case may be, or (ii) to rescind Owner’s order suspending the Work to which reference is made in subsection (a) of this
Section 14.04 within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, or if the delay described in subsection (b) of this Section 14.04 shall be



29









continuing beyond ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, then this Agreement may be terminated by Contractor by written notice to Owner setting
forth the date of termination, which date shall not be sooner than ten (10) days after the date of the notice. If, within said ten (10) day period, the matter giving rise to Contractor’s right to terminate this Agreement shall not
have been cured or discontinued, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated for convenience and Contractor shall be compensated in the manner and to the extent set forth in Section 14.02 hereof.

14.05 If, without good cause, Owner shall fail after the due date to make
payment on any approved Application for Payment, then Contractor immediately shall serve Owner with notice thereof, and, if Owner shall fail to cause such Application for Payment to be issued or to make such payment, as the case may be, within ten
(10) days after receipt of such notice, then Contractor may suspend its Work by written notice to Owner setting forth the date of such suspension, which date shall not be sooner than ten (10) days after the date of the notice and

ARTICLE XIX
Hazardous Materials

19.01 Contractor shall not cause or permit the Project or the Project site to be used to generate, manufacture, refine,

Contractor shall comply with and ensure compliance by all Trade Contractors, sub-Trade Contractors and vendors with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, whenever and by whomever triggered, and shall obtain
and comply with, and ensure that all Trade Contractors, sub-Trade Contractors and vendors obtain and comply with, any and all approvals, registrations or permits required thereunder. Contractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless, as defined

in addition to any and all other obligations and liabilities Contractor may have to the Owner at common law, and shall survive Final Completion of the Work.


31








19.02 Contractor shall not be required to perform any Work in an area affected by suspected or confirmed
Hazardous Materials. Such Work shall be resumed as Owner and Contractor agree in writing, and only if (i) Owner causes remedial Work to be performed which results in the absence of Hazardous Materials or provides a proper certification to
Contractor that materials suspected to be Hazardous Materials are, in fact, not Hazardous Materials and (ii) the Work may safely and lawfully proceed, as certified either by an appropriate governmental authority (receipt of an ACP-5, or
equivalent) or by an environmental engineer reasonably satisfactory to both Owner and Contractor who shall submit a written report to both Owner and Contractor evidencing such certification (such engineer shall be retained, and be paid by Owner).


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Contractor shall not be required to perform any services or Work or other activities in connection with suspected or confirmed existing Hazardous Materials. Owner hereby agrees to release, remise and discharge Contractor from any and all
claim, demands and liability in connection with suspected and confirmed existing Hazardous Materials, whether now known or unknown, except to the extent any such claim, demand or liability is caused by the negligence of Contractor. In no event, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shall Contractor have any indemnification obligations to Owner in connection with any claim, damage, loss, expense, cost or liability arising out of, or in connection with, the existence of
any suspected or confirmed Hazardous Materials presently existing at the Project, except to the extent arising out of Contractor’s negligence. Owner hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Contractor, its officers, directors and employees

ARTICLE XX
Materials and Equipment

20.01 As the Work progresses, title to each item of material or equipment
shall vest in Owner upon the earlier to occur of (a) incorporation of such item into the Work, or (b) payment for such item by Owner. Each such item shall then become the sole property of Owner, subject to the right of Owner to reject the
same at any time prior to Final Completion for failure to conform to the Contract Documents. Accordingly, Contractor shall be responsible for arranging for insuring materials and equipment until the same are incorporated into the Work unless
otherwise covered by Owner’s Builders Risk insurance.

20.02 Contractor shall require each Trade Contractor to warrant that (a) title to all materials and equipment incorporated in the Work or paid for by Owner shall pass to Owner free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and
encumbrances of every kind, and (b) that no materials or equipment covered by any Application for Payment will have been acquired by any other person performing work at the Project site or furnishing materials and equipment in connection with
the Work subject to an agreement under which an interest therein or an encumbrance thereon shall have been retained by the seller or otherwise imposed by seller or any other person.


32








20.03 (a) Except as otherwise agreed to as Owner approved individual Trade Contract awards, or as
included in the GMP, it is not anticipated that Contractor will be paid for stored offsite materials (with the exception of the curtain wall Trade Contract), however, Owner, in its sole discretion, can elect to pay Contractor in accordance with this
Section 20.03. In such event Contractor shall be entitled to arrange for the pre-purchase of certain materials and equipment to be incorporated in the Work provided that Owner shall have given its prior written consent thereto in each instance.
If Owner shall have approved any such pre-purchasing of materials or equipment as aforesaid, Contractor shall pre-purchase the same in Owner’s name, and on Owner’s behalf. In such event, Owner shall advance the amount necessary to enable
Contractor or its Trade Contractor to pre-purchase such materials or equipment upon presentation to Owner of a bill or statement therefor, together with any other documents as reasonably may be requested by Owner. Contractor, simultaneously with its
receipt of any such advance from Owner, shall deliver to Owner a bill of sale with respect to the materials or equipment pre-purchased evidencing unencumbered title to the same in Owner’s name, together with any warranties, certificates of
insurance and other documents requested by Owner evidencing that such materials and equipment are covered by such insurance as shall have been specified by Owner;

(b) All materials and equipment pre-purchased as aforesaid shall be stored at the Project site or at such off-Project site
storage locations as shall have been approved in writing in each instance by Owner. Any materials or equipment stored at such off-Project site storage locations shall be segregated from materials and equipment of others, shall be clearly labeled to
evidence Owner’s ownership interest and shall otherwise be stored in such manner as directed by Owner. Insurance premiums, storage costs and other reasonable expenses incurred by reason of such off-Project site storage in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 20.03 shall be included in the Reimbursable Costs. The risk of loss or damage to such materials and equipment shall remain with Trade Contractor until the delivery of such materials and equipment to the Project site,
to the extent and as set forth in Section 20.01 hereof;

(c) All Trade Contracts, agreements, guarantees, or warranties executed or delivered in connection with materials and equipment which are pre-purchased by Contractor as provided herein shall provide that if, upon inspection of the same by
Contractor or Architect, or if, upon incorporation of the same in the Project, Owner, Contractor or Architect determines that such materials or equipment, or any portion thereof, are faulty or defective in any respect, such materials or equipment,
or portion thereof, shall be replaced, at such Trade Contractor’s sole cost and expense, promptly after receipt of written notice to such effect from Owner, Architect or Contractor.

ARTICLE XXI
Substitutions

21.01 (a) The
products, materials and equipment of manufacturers referred to in the Construction Documents are intended to establish the standard of quality and design required by Architect. Anything contained in the Construction Documents to the contrary
notwithstanding, materials of manufacturers other than those specified may be used only if accepted by Owner as provided in this Article XXI.


33








(b) Architect, in consultation with Owner, shall be the judge of equivalency of proposed substitute
materials. Architect shall make written recommendations of acceptance or rejection of substitute products, materials or equipment to Owner. Owner shall then authorize Architect to issue to Contractor written approval or rejection of the
substitution. Contractor shall inform the appropriate Trade Contractor of said approval or rejection. Owner, in its reasonable discretion, may authorize rejection of a proposed substitution notwithstanding the fact that Architect may have judged it
equivalent and recommended acceptance of the same.

21.02
(a) When two or more products are specified in the Construction Documents for an item of Work, any one thereof shall be deemed acceptable and Contractor shall have the choice as to which product to use.

(b) When only one product is specified in the Construction Documents for an
item of Work and the term “or equal” is used in connection with such product, Contractor may offer a substitution by submitting a written application to Architect, in sufficient time (taking into account the progress of the Work, the
period of delivery of the goods concerned and adequate time for Architect’s review), setting forth and fully identifying (i) the proposed substitute, together with substantiating data, samples, brochures and other supporting documentation
of the substitute it proposed, including, without limitation, evidence that the proposed substitution (w) is equal in quality and serviceability to the specified item, (x) will not entail changes in detail, schedule and construction of
related Work, (y) conforms with the design of the Project and its artistic intent, and (z) will not result in an increase in the cost of the Work or alternatively, will result in a cost change as indicated in the application, and
(ii) the changes in other parts of the Work required by reason of the proposed substitute, and the cost consequences associated therewith, for which cost consequences Owner shall be responsible. A copy of any such application shall be delivered
to Owner simultaneously with its delivery to Architect.

(c)
When only one product is specified in the Construction Documents for an item of Work and the term “or equal” is not used in connection with such product, Owner, in its sole and absolute discretion (as provided in Section 22.01(b)
hereof), may authorize the rejection of any substitution proposed by Contractor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such specified product shall become unavailable for a material period of time and Owner receives reasonably satisfactory proof from
Contractor that the same shall be unavailable for reasons other than the failure of Contractor or a Trade Contractor to order such product in a timely manner, consistent with the Contract Documents and the scheduling requirements for the Work, then,
in such event, Owner shall consent to such substitution, in which event any change in costs incurred in connection with the use of such substitution shall be confirmed by a Change Order.

21.03 Contractor shall support any request for a substitution with sufficient evidence to permit Architect to make a fair
and equitable recommendation to Owner on the merits of the proposal. Any item by a manufacturer other than those cited in the Construction Documents, or of brand name, or model number or size or generic species other than those cited in the
Construction Documents, shall be considered a substitution.

21.04 Acceptance of substitutions shall not relieve the appropriate Trade Contractor from



34









responsibility for compliance with all of the requirements of the underlying Contract Documents. If changes in other parts of the Work are required by reason
of approved substitutions, the costs of any such changes shall be included in the cost of the Work.

21.05 In no event shall the Project Schedule be adjusted by any circumstance resulting from a proposed substitution, nor shall Contractor be entitled to
any compensation related thereto, without the issuance of a change order approved by Owner in accordance with Article XXI hereof.

ARTICLE XXII
Changes in the Work


22.01 (a) A Change Order shall be the instrument
required to authorize any change in the Project which would result in (i) a change in Drawings or Specifications, or any other Contract Documents, (ii) a deviation from design standards established for the Project or any part thereof,
(iii) an extension of the Substantial Completion Date or the Final Completion Date from and after the date of the commencement of the Construction Phase.


(b) Owner, without invalidating or abandoning this Agreement, may at any time require changes in the Work consisting of additions, deletions or other
revisions. All such required changes in the Work shall be requested in writing by Owner (a “Request for Proposal”), shall be submitted to Contractor, and, in order to be deemed part of, or deleted from, the Work and authorized by Owner,
shall be executed in the manner set forth below:

(i) Forthwith upon Contractor’s receipt of a Request for Proposal, Contractor shall prepare and furnish to Owner a signed statement (“Proposal”), in a form satisfactory to Owner, setting forth in detail, with suitable
breakdowns by trades and work classifications, and using the “unit price” lump sum and/or other costing method specified by Owner, Contractor’s estimate of (x) the cost, or savings, of the change reflected in the Request for
Proposal, which cost shall reflect the most economical manner of affecting such Change, (y) the resulting increase or decrease in the cost of the Work, and (z) the changes in the Work or the Progress Schedule (including the Substantial
Completion Date and the Final Completion Date) which would result from implementation of the Request for Proposal.

(ii) If Owner approves the Contractor’s Statement, Owner shall issue to Contractor a written change order (the “Change
Order”) signed by Owner, and the Substantial Completion Date and the Final Completion Date and the Contract Documents, as the case may be, shall be adjusted if required, in accordance with Section 3.06 above. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, no changes shall be authorized or performed in violation of any consent letters signed by Contractor to Owner.

(c) Any work performed by Contractor or any Trade Contractor which is contrary to the Work, as required by the Contract Documents, shall be performed at
Contractor’s or such Trade Contractor’s sole risk, cost and expense, unless the same shall have been authorized by a Change Order, or an Emergency Change Order therefor shall have been confirmed by Owner by a duly issued Change Order, in
accordance with Section 22.05 hereof.


35








22.02 (a) If Owner shall dispute any of the items set forth in the Proposal, then Owner shall give
Contractor written notice of such dispute, which notice shall set forth (i) those items in the Proposal which Owner disputes, (ii) those items in the Proposal which Owner does not dispute, and (iii) whether Owner desires that
Contractor perform any portion of the change (x) corresponding to a non-disputed item, or (y) corresponding to a disputed item.

(b) If Owner’s dispute notice shall direct Contractor to perform any change corresponding to a non-disputed item, that portion of the Proposal which
related to the non-disputed item, together with Owner’s direction to Contractor to perform the change corresponding to the non-disputed item, as set forth in Owner’s dispute notice, shall constitute a validly issued Change Order, and
Contractor shall promptly undertake to perform the same, subject to 22.01(c).

(c) If Owner’s dispute notice shall direct Contractor to perform any change corresponding to a disputed item, Owner’s dispute notice shall be deemed a notice of demand for prompt resolution of the subject
matter of the dispute by the mutual agreement of the parties, failing which it shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction, as provided in Section 29.16 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractor shall promptly undertake to
perform and pursue prosecution of the change corresponding to the disputed item during the pendency of any such bona fide dispute, and the determination reached by mutual agreement or rendered by such court of law relative to the disputed item,
together with Owner’s direction to Contractor to perform the change corresponding to the disputed item, as set forth in Owner’s dispute notice, shall constitute a validly issued Change Order.

22.03 When paid by Owner to Contractor in accordance with a validly issued
Change Order, the compensation specified in a Change Order shall constitute full payment for the additional Work covered thereby and for any delay, disruption, cost, or expense occasioned by reason of such change and shall release Owner from any
further liability in respect of the same, unless Contractor expressly reserves such rights in writing prior to acceptance of such compensation.

22.04 No time extension shall be granted by reason of the issuance of any Change Order unless it is expressly stated therein.

22.05 Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Contractor
and Architect shall have the authority to order “emergency changes” in the Work, without the prior written approval of Owner, by the issuance of a written order (an “Emergency Change Order”). For purposes of this Agreement,
“emergency changes” in the Work shall mean only changes which are required in the case of an emergency to insure the safety of persons or the Work and which, in the interest of expediency, Contractor determines should be made without
obtaining the prior written approval of Owner. Contractor shall (x) notify Owner that it has issued an Emergency Change Order within forty-eight (48) hours after the same has been issued, which notification shall set forth the reason
giving rise to the issuance of the same, and (y) promptly furnish Owner with copies of all such Emergency Change Orders. Valid Emergency Change Orders shall be confirmed by Owner by a duly issued Change Order.

22.06 Architect and Contractor shall have the authority to resolve conflicts
in the



36









Construction Documents or to order minor changes to avoid conflicts between different trades by the issuance of written field orders (“Field
Orders”); provided, however, that in no event shall any Field Order be issued to authorize any clarification or change which may necessitate or warrant a Change Order, an Emergency Change Order, or which may result in (a) a change in the
character or scope of the Project or any part thereof, (b) a change in the Project Budget, (c) a change in the time set forth in the Progress Schedule for the performance of the Work, or (d) any extension of the Substantial Completion
Date or the Final Completion Date, as each of the foregoing may only be authorized by a Change Order. Copies of all Field Orders shall be submitted by Contractor promptly to Owner.

22.07 Contractor shall provide to Owner and Architect copies of all change orders issued by Contractor to Trade Contractors,
including time and material field tickets and other documentation acknowledging performance of the Work, it being agreed that Trade Contract Change Orders which do not increase GMP may be issued by Contractor without prior approval by Owner.


ARTICLE XXIII
Inspection and Testing

23.01 If the underlying Contract Documents or any laws, rules, ordinances or regulations of any Federal, State or local governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over the Work require that any Work be inspected or tested, Contractor shall give Owner and Architect timely notice of readiness of the Work for inspection or testing and the date fixed for such inspection or testing. Owner shall
perform all controlled inspections.

23.02 (a) Whenever,
in the opinion of Owner, it is desirable to require special inspection or testing of the Work or its individual components, Owner shall have authority to do so whether or not such Work is then fabricated, installed, covered or completed. All costs
incurred in connection with such special inspection or testing shall be a Reimbursable Cost by the issuance of a Change Order unless it reveals a test failure as a result of the acts or omissions of Contractor in which event, Contractor shall bear,
all costs of such special inspection or testing, including and without limitation without increase to GMP. All Trade Contracts shall provide that if a test failure is a result of the acts or omissions of a Trade Contractor then that Trade Contractor
shall bear, at its sole cost and expense, all such costs of special inspection or testing. No inspection performed or failed to be performed by Owner hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of any of Contractor’s obligations hereunder or be
construed as an approval or acceptance of the Work or any part thereof.

(b) In the event of a test failure of any item of the Work, Owner may require inspection or testing of any or all of the other similar items of the Work. The costs and expenses incurred by Contractor in connection with such inspection or
testing set forth in this Section 23.02(b) shall be a cost of the Work unless (i) the test failure prompting such additional testing or inspection was a result of the acts or omissions of Contractor or the failure of Contractor to comply
with the provisions of this Agreement or (ii) such additional testing or inspection results in a test failure which results from the acts or omissions of Contractor, in which event, Contractor shall bear, at its sole cost and expense, all costs
of such additional inspection or testing. All Trade Contracts shall provide that in the event of a test failure of any term of the Work the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such testing or inspection shall be borne by the responsible
Trade Contractor.


37








23.03 If any Work shall be covered or concealed by Contractor or permitted to be covered or concealed by
Contractor, contrary to the written request of Owner or Architect or the Contract Documents, such Work, if required by Owner or Architect, shall be uncovered for examination, inspection or testing at Contractor’s sole cost and expense. If any
such test results are below specified minimums, Owner may order additional examination, testing or inspection. Such additional examination, inspection or testing shall be at Contractor sole cost and expense if Contractor knew of such request and
failed to advise the appropriate Trade Contractor. Should Architect or Owner have reason to believe that defects exist in any Work which has already been covered or concealed, although no request not to cover or conceal such Work had been previously
made by Owner or Architect such Work, if required by Owner, be promptly uncovered by Contractor and subjected to such tests, inspection or examination as may be deemed appropriate by Owner, Engineer or Architect. In such case, the provisions of
Sections 24.02(a), (b) and (c) shall control with respect to the costs associated with such uncovering.

23.04 Any Work not approved by Owner or Architect in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall immediately be reconstructed, made good, replaced
or corrected by Contractor, the responsible Trade Contractor, or another Trade Contractor to be retained by Contractor, including portions of the Work destroyed or damaged by such removal or replacement, at Contractor’s or the responsible Trade
Contractor’s sole cost and expense, to the extent the same is caused by, or results respectively from, Contractor’s or its Trade Contractors’ acts or omissions or the failure of either of the foregoing to comply with the provisions of
this Agreement or the Trade Contract, respectively. All rejected materials shall be removed from the Project site, within a reasonable period of time. Acceptance of materials and workmanship by Owner shall not relieve Contractor or any Trade
Contractor from their liability for or obligation to replace all Work which is not in full compliance with the underlying Contract Documents.

23.05 At Owner’s option, Owner may accept defective or nonconforming Work or materials, instead of requiring its removal, correction or replacement,
as the case may be, and a Change Order shall be issued to reflect a reduction in the Trade Contract price, in an amount equal to the aggregate cost of labor and materials which would have been incurred by the responsible Trade Contractor if Owner
had required said Trade Contractor to repair or replace such defective nonconforming Work in accordance with the terms of the Trade Contract. Such adjustment shall be effected whether or not final payment has been made.

23.06 Owner’s Consultants shall perform Controlled Inspection, as
defined by the Building Code of the City/Town of Hanover, New Jersey (“Code”).

ARTICLE XXIV
Ownership and Use of
Documents; Confidentiality

24.01 Contractor agrees that the Contract Documents, technical data and other information received by it from Owner, Architect and Consultants under or in connection with this Agreement and any and all other
information concerning Owner or Owner’s operations that Contractor may



38









obtain or become aware of shall be accepted and treated as proprietary information which has a substantial commercial value to Owner, and that Contractor
will not use or disclose any such Contract Documents, technical data and other information in any manner except to the extent that such use or disclosure may be necessary for the performance of the Work hereunder. Without limitation of the
foregoing, all said documents furnished to Contractor are to be used only with respect to this Project and are not to be used on or in connection with any other project. Submission or distribution of documents to meet official regulatory
requirements or for other proper and necessary purposes in connection with the performance of the Work at the Project shall not be construed as a violation of this Section 24.01.

24.02 Except as otherwise provided herein, Contractor is specifically prohibited from photographing any portion of the Work
for publicity and advertising or for any other purpose without the prior written permission of Owner, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Further, Contractor shall not release confidential information on the Project or the subject matter of
this Agreement to the public without the prior written consent of Owner.

24.03 The requirements of this Article shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall be binding upon Contractor. Contractor shall include the requirements of this Article in all Trade Contracts.


ARTICLE XXV
Nondisclosure

25.01 Without limitation of the provisions of Article XXIV hereof, it is agreed that neither Contractor nor any Trade Contractor shall divulge information
concerning the Project or concerning Owner or Owner’s operations to anyone without Owner’s prior written consent, except as otherwise specifically permitted by the Contract Documents and except such public disclosures as may be required by
law. If such disclosure is required by law, Contractor or any Trade Contractor in question shall provide Owner with a copy of any such proposed public disclosure in advance and will endeavor to incorporate any comments Owner may suggest in such
regard. Contractor shall however, be entitled to describe the Project in its brochures and proposals without Owner’s prior consent provided no confidential information is disclosed.

25.02 Except as required by law no signs advertising the Work to be performed by Contractor or any Trade Contractor or
identifying any person, firm or entity concerned with the Work to be performed by Contractor or any Trade Contractor shall be allowed at the Project site or elsewhere unless approved in writing by Owner in advance, which approval for Project signage
shall not be unreasonably withheld.


39








ARTICLE XXVI
Owner’s Right To Perform Work
And to Award Separate Contracts;
and Cooperation with Separate Contractors

26.01 If Contractor causes damage to the property of Owner or to other work or property on the Project site, Contractor shall promptly remedy such damage
as provided in this Agreement.

26.02 If Contractor delays or
causes damage to the work or property of any separate contractor, Contractor shall, upon due notice, promptly attempt to settle with such other contractor by agreement, or otherwise to resolve the dispute.

26.03 The requirements of this Article shall be included in all Trade
Contracts.

ARTICLE XXVII
Equal Opportunity

27.01 Contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, national origin, marital status,
sex, disability, sexual preference or age. This provision shall not apply with respect to sex, disability or age where either is a bona fide occupational qualification; nor shall it apply with respect to age where a bona fide retirement plan
prevents employment of persons above a stated age or where there is a statutory requirement imposing age limitations. Contractor will take such actions as are necessary to ensure that employees and applicants for employment are treated without
regard to their race, creed, color, national origin, marital status, sex, sexual preference or age. As used herein, the term “treated” shall mean and include, without limitation, the following: recruited, whether by advertising or other
means; compensated, whether in the form of rates of pay or other forms of compensation; selected for training, including apprenticeship; promoted; upgraded; demoted; downgraded; transferred; laid off; and terminated.

27.02 Contractor will comply with the provisions of all rules, regulations,
statutes, ordinances or other laws of all local, State or Federal regulatory or governmental bodies. Contractor shall furnish all information and reports, if applicable, required by such regulatory and governmental bodies to determine
Contractor’s compliance with the provisions of this Article and such laws, and will permit access to its books, records and accounts by Owner and any such regulatory or governmental body during regular business hours for purposes of
investigation to ascertain compliance with applicable laws.

ARTICLE XXIII
Claims For Damages

With the exception of third-party claims or impleader, no action or proceeding shall lie or be maintained by Contractor against Owner, Architect or Consultants upon any claim arising out of or based upon the Contract Documents or by reason
of any act or omission or any requirements relating to the giving of notices or information, unless such action or proceeding shall be commenced within one (1) year after the Final Completion of the Work or, if this Agreement is earlier
terminated, within one (1) year following the date of such earlier termination. This limitation shall not limit Contractor’s right to seek indemnification or contribution from Owner in actions commenced by third parties. This Article XXIII
shall not be deemed or construed to modify any other provision hereof relating to waivers of claims by Contractor. Contractor shall cause each Trade Contract to contain like provisions to this Article XXIII and a provision requiring like provisions
to be contained in subcontracts of any tier.

ARTICLE XXIX

Additional Provisions

41








29.04 Access and Cooperation. Contractor agrees (a) to grant Owner, Architect and Consultants
access to the Work whenever same is in progress, and (b) to cooperate with Owner, Architect, Engineer and Consultants throughout the performance of the Work to the end that the Project may be completed in the most expeditious and economic

therewith, maintain the Construction Budget and the Progress Schedule, the Substantial Completion Date and the Final Completion Date and shall perform all other obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement as if no dispute shall
have arisen. During the pendency of any such dispute, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Contractor shall be entitled to receive payments from Owner only on account of non-disputed items and payments on account of disputed items

Agreement are solely for the purpose of aiding and assisting in the location of different material in this Agreement and are not to be considered under any circumstances as parts, provisions or interpretations of this Agreement.

29.09 No Waiver. The failure of either party to insist upon the strict
performance of any provisions of this Agreement, the failure of either party to exercise any right, option or remedy hereby reserved, or the existence of any course of performance hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision hereof
or of any such right, option or remedy or as a waiver for the future of any such provision, right, option or remedy or as a waiver of a subsequent breach thereof. The consent or approval by either party of any act by the other party requiring such
party’s consent or approval shall not be construed to waive or render unnecessary the requirement for that party’s consent or approval of any subsequent similar act by the other party. The payment by Owner of any amount due hereunder with

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, Contractor shall indemnify and
hold harmless Owner and its respective subsidiaries, officers, directors, partners, members, managers, agents, employees, successors, and assigns (collectively, “Indemnitees”, individually, “Indemnitee”) from and against all

disease or death, or damage or injury to, loss of or destruction of property (including tools, equipment, plant and the buildings at the Project site, but excluding the Work itself) including the loss of use resulting therefrom, sustained or
purported to have been sustained as a result of performance of the Work attributable to any negligent act or omission of Contractor, its employees, Trade Contractors, representatives or other persons for whom Contractor is responsible who are at the
Project site at any time during the period the Work is being performed and (ii) provided Owner has paid Contractor for work performed by Trade Contractor, Subcontractor or supplier any lien or notice of lien filed, by any such Trade Contractor
or Subcontractor or supplier against the property in connection with the Work. Such obligation shall not be construed to negate, abridge, or otherwise reduce any other right or obligation of indemnity which would otherwise exist as to any
Indemnitee.

(b) In any and all claims against any Indemnitee
by any employee of Contractor, or of its Trade Contractors or anyone directly or indirectly employed by either Contractor or its Trade Contractors or anyone for whose acts either Contractor or its Trade Contractors may be liable, the indemnification
obligation under this Section 29.11 shall not be limited in any way by any limitation on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Contractor under workers’ or workmen’s compensation acts, disability
acts or other employee benefit acts.

29.11
Severability. If any provision of the underlying Contract Documents is invalid or unenforceable as against any person, party or under certain circumstances, the remainder of the underlying Contract Documents and the applicability of such

29.16 Binding Effect. It is expressly understood by the parties hereto
that delivery by Owner of the within Agreement for review and execution by Contractor shall confer no rights nor impose any obligations on either party, unless and until both Contractor and Owner shall have executed this Agreement.

to be performed or payments to be made relative to the Project must be in writing to be valid.

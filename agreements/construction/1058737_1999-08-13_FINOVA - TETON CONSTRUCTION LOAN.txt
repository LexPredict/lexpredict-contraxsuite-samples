is actually received by Lender; (y) interest on the outstanding unpaid principal
balance of the Working  Capital  Loan shall be charged  during any grace  period

applied  as a  payment  under the  Working  Capital  Loan  that is  subsequently
invalidated,  set aside or required to be repaid to any other  person or entity,

compliance with the borrowing limitations set forth in the Indenture.

(ix)  Additional  Information.  Borrower will deliver to Lender the reports
and other information required pursuant to paragraph 3.3, and Borrower will
make  available  such further  information  as Lender may from time to time
reasonably request.

(e) Subordination of Indebtedness Owing to Affiliates.  Borrower will cause
any and all indebtedness owing by it to its shareholders,  directors,  officers,
partners,  members  or  managers,  as the case may be,  or to the  relatives  or
Affiliates  of  Borrower  or any of  the  foregoing,  and  all  liens,  security
interests  and other charges on the assets of Borrower in favor of the foregoing
persons to be fully  subordinated in all aspects to the Obligations  pursuant to
written  agreements  satisfactory  to  Lender;  provided,  however,  that (A) if
neither an Event of Default nor an  Incipient  Default then exists or will exist
after giving effect to such payment,  such subordination shall not extend to (i)
reasonable  bonuses,  salaries,  other  compensation  and  fees  at  normal  and
customary  rates for services  actually  rendered so long as the payment of such
salaries and fees is not prohibited or otherwise limited pursuant to any


24
<PAGE>


provision  set  forth in the  Schedule  and (ii)  payments  expressly  permitted
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (B) any such subordination  shall be
subject to section 4.08 of the Indenture.

(f) Payment of Taxes.  Borrower will file when due all tax returns and will
pay  when  due all  taxes,  if any,  required  to be  filed by it or paid by it,
including real estate taxes and assessments  relating to the Time-Share  Project
or the  Collateral.  Borrower  will  provide to Lender not more than thirty (30)
days after the date on which such  Impositions were required to be paid pursuant
to the preceding  sentence prior to being deemed  delinquent,  evidence that all
taxes  required to be paid pursuant to the  preceding  sentence on the Units and
Time-Share Project common areas and related amenities have been paid in full.

(g) Payment of  Impositions.  Borrower  will  promptly  pay upon demand all
Impositions  imposed upon Lender by any state of the United  States or political
subdivision  thereof or the United States by reason of the Loan  Documents,  the
Collateral  and/or any sale,  rental,  use, delivery or transfer of title to the
Collateral,  other than any tax measured by net income  payable by Lender to any
State of the United  States or  political  subdivision  thereof or to the United
States of America  under  Section 11 or 1201 of the Internal  Revenue  Code,  as
amended,  in  consequence  of the receipt of payments  provided  for in the Loan
Documents  and other than any general  franchise  tax or business  license taxes
measured by Lender's  gross  income.  If it is unlawful for Borrower to pay such
Impositions,  Borrower shall not be required to pay such Impositions; but Lender
may  demand  payment  of such  additional  amount as is  necessary  to  maintain
Lender's yields on the Receivables  Loan,  Construction Loan and Working Capital
Loan in either a single payment or at Lender's option, in installment  payments,
and  Borrower  will pay such amount upon  demand.  If it is unlawful to pay such
additional  amount,  Borrower  shall not be  required  to pay it; but Lender may
demand  immediate  payment  of  the  Obligations  in  full  (together  with  the
applicable  Receivables Loan Prepayment  Premium,  Construction  Loan Prepayment
Premium  and  Working  Capital  Loan  Prepayment),  and  Borrower  will  pay the
Obligations in full within sixty (60) days after such demand.  If Lender has not
received  evidence  satisfactory to it from Borrower that such  Impositions have
been paid by Borrower  within five (5) days after demand was made upon  Borrower
to make such  payment,  Lender may, at its option,  pay the same,  and  Borrower
shall  immediately  reimburse  Lender for such sums so expended,  together  with
interest thereon at the Default Rate until paid.

(h) Further  Assurance.  Borrower  will execute or cause to be executed all
documents and do or cause to be done all acts reasonably necessary for Lender to
perfect or evidence  and to continue  the  perfection  of the liens and security
interest  of Lender in the  Collateral  or  otherwise  to effect  the intent and
purposes of the Loan Documents.

(i)  Fulfillment of Obligations to Purchasers.  Borrower will fulfill,  and
will  use  its  best  efforts  cause  its  Affiliates,  agents  and  independent
contractors at all times to fulfill,  all their respective material  obligations
to Purchasers.  Borrower will Perform all of its material  obligations under the
Time-Share Program Consumer Documents and the Time-Share Program Governing
Documents.

(j)  Material  Increases  to  Assessments.  Borrower  (i) will use its best
efforts to cause the  Time-Share  Association  to (A) discharge its  obligations
under the Time-Share  Program Governing  Documents and (B) maintain a reasonable
reserve for capital  improvements to the Time-Share  Project and (ii) so long as
Borrower  controls the Time-Share  Association  will pay to such association not
less often than once every twelve (12) months,  the  difference  between (A) the
cumulative  total amount of the maintenance and operating  expenses  incurred by
the  Time-Share  Association,  together  with a  reasonable  reserve for capital
improvements  and the amount of any installment of real property taxes currently
due and payable with respect to the  Time-Share  Project and related  amenities,
through the end of the calendar month  preceding the month in which such payment
is made and (B) the  cumulative  total  amount  of  assessments  payable  to the

(k)  Maintenance  of  Time-Share  Project  and Other  Property.  Teton will
maintain or cause to be maintained in good condition and repair all common areas
in the Time-Share  Project and other on-site  amenities which have been promised
or  represented  as  being  available  to  Purchasers  and  which  are  not  the
responsibility  of the  Time-Share  Association  to maintain and repair,  to the
extent  owned  by  Borrower  or  an  Affiliate  of  Borrower,  all  portions  of
improvements  in which  Units  are  located  and are not part of the  Time-Share
Project.  Teton will  maintain or use its best  efforts to cause the  Time-Share
Association to maintain a reasonable reserve to assure compliance with the terms
of the foregoing sentence.

(l)  Maintenance  of Larger  Tract.  To the extent  either  the  Time-Share
Project is part of a larger common  ownership  regime or planned  development or
parts of  buildings  in which Units are  located are not part of the  Time-Share
Project, Teton will pay its commercially  reasonable share of common expenses to
be  allocated  to  the  Time-Share  Project.   Borrower  will  use  commercially
reasonable  efforts  to  cause  all  such  property  which  is not  part  of the
Time-Share Project to be professionally managed in a first class manner.

(m)  Collection of  Receivables  Collateral.  Borrower  will  undertake the
diligent,  timely and commercially  reasonable  collection of amounts delinquent
under each Instrument which  constitutes part of the Receivables  Collateral and
under each Purchase Contract and Reservation  Agreement which constitute part of
the Working  Capital Loan  Collateral  and will bear the entire  expense of such
collection.  Lender shall have no  obligation to undertake any action to collect
under any Instrument.

(n) Notice of Lender's Interest. Borrower will deliver under its letterhead
notice of Lender's  interest in the  Receivables  Collateral and Working Capital
Loan  Collateral to persons  bound  thereby,  if requested,  and will cause such
notice to comply with applicable law.

(o) Year 2000.  Borrower  shall take all action  necessary  to assure  that
there will be no material adverse change to Borrower's business by reason of the
advent of the year 2000,  including without  limitation that all  computer-based
systems,  embedded  microchips  and other  processing  capabilities  effectively
recognize and process dates after April 1, 1999. At Lender's  request,  Borrower
shall  provide  to  Lender  assurance  reasonably   acceptable  to  Lender  that
Borrower's  computer-based  systems,  embedded  microchips and other  processing
capabilities are year 2000 compatible.

(p) Transfer to the Time-Share Association. On or before the earlier of (i)
the obtaining of a certificate  of occupancy for the  Improvements  or (ii) June
30, 2000, Borrower shall cause to be transferred to the Time-Share  Association,
the golf, ski and other recreation benefits described in paragraph 4.1(o).

(q) Post  Closing.  Within seven (7) Business  Days  following the Required
Closing Date,  Raintree  shall deliver to Lender a favorable  opinion of counsel
satisfactory  in form and  substance to Lender from  Raintree's  Texas  counsel,
opining as to the  enforceability of this Agreement and each of the Construction
Loan Note, Receivables Loan Note and Working Capital Loan Note made and executed
by  Raintree.  In the  event  modifications  are  required  to be  made  in this
Agreement  or any of the  aforementioned  notes in order for counsel to render a
favorable opinion to Lender, Borrower agrees to promptly make such modifications
to the satisfaction of Lender and to Raintree's opining counsel.

(r)  Escrow.  Unless  Borrower  is  required  pursuant  to the  terms  of a
particular  Reservation  Agreement to refund monies to the Purchaser thereunder,
Borrower  agrees  to cause  all  monies  paid  under  Working  Capital  Eligible
Instruments  to remain  within the Escrow until the closing of the sale which is
the subject matter of the Reservation Agreement. Borrower agrees to give written
notice to Lender  within five  Business  Days after such time as any monies paid
under a Working  Capital  Eligible  Instrument  are  refunded  to the  Purchaser
thereunder.

6.2 Borrower's Negative Covenants.

(a) Change in Borrower's Name or Principal Place of Business. Borrower will
not change its name or move its principal  place of business or chief  executive
office  except  upon not less than  sixty  (60) days'  prior  written  notice to
Lender.

26

(b) Restrictions on Additional Indebtedness.

(i) Subject to the additional  restrictions  set forth in paragraph  6.2(c)
below, Teton will not incur any additional indebtedness, including, without
limitation, any liability under any capitalized lease or any liability as a
guarantor  or  other  contingent   liability,   except  for  the  following
("Permitted Debt"): (ii) short term accounts payable incurred in connection
with the  operation of the  Time-Share  Project in the  ordinary  course of
business;  or (iii)  indebtedness  resulting  from  borrowings  which  were
obtained under financings of time-share  receivables in the ordinary course
of Teton's  business and Lender has elected,  or is deemed to have elected,
not to provide  such  financing  pursuant to the  provisions  of  paragraph
6.2(b)(ii) below and provided that such  indebtedness  does not violate any
of the provisions of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,  as a condition to approval of any third party loan or financing
which is not  Permitted  Debt,  Lender may  require  that Teton  deliver to
Lender copies of the  financing  documents  and such other  information  as
Lender may reasonably  request with respect to such third party loan and/or
financing and estoppel  certificates,  agreements providing notice and cure
rights and  subordination  agreements  executed by the person providing the
financing.

(ii) If, during the Receivables Loan Borrowing Term, Teton wishes to accept
an offer from a third party for financing of time share receivables,  Teton
shall give Lender  written  notice of its intent to do so  together  with a
copy of the written  proposal for the financing from the prospective  third
party lender.  Lender shall have ten (10) Business Days from receipt of the
notice and any other items  reasonably  requested  by Lender in  connection
with such proposed  financing to issue a financing  proposal.  Lender shall
have forty five (45) days  following the receipt of the financing  proposal
timely  accepted by Teton within which to issue a commitment to extend such
financing  upon  terms  substantially   equivalent  to  the  terms  of  the
Receivables Loan as contained in this Agreement;  provided, however, Lender
shall have no obligation to issue such commitment. The failure of Lender to
issue a commitment  within the foregoing  period of time shall be deemed to
be an election by Lender not to extend such financing. If Lender elects not
to extend such  financing,  Teton shall be free to accept the proposal from
such third party  lender and close such  transaction.  The  obtaining  by a
particular  Purchaser  of financing of the  acquisition  of the  Time-Share
Interests  purchased  by  such  Purchaser  shall  not  be  subject  to  the
provisions of this paragraph 6.2(b)(ii).

(c)  Restrictions on Liens or Transfers.  Teton,  without the prior written
consent of Lender,  will not:  (i) sell,  convey,  lease,  pledge,  hypothecate,
encumber  or  otherwise  transfer  any  security  for  the  Performance  of  the
Obligations  other than the sale of Time-Share  Interests in the ordinary course
of business  provided that any payment due to Lender as a result of such sale is
paid to Lender.  In connection with the lease of any commercial space within the
Time-Share  Project,  in addition to obtaining  the consent of Lender as to such
lease, the lease agreement shall be collaterally  assigned to Lender pursuant to
an  assignment  satisfactory  to Lender as further  security for the payment and
Performance  of the  Obligations  and all  proceeds  from  such  lease  shall be
remitted to Lender so long as there is an outstanding  unpaid principal  balance
due under the Construction Loan, for application against such principal balance;
(ii)  permit  or  suffer  to  exist  any  liens,  security  interests  or  other
encumbrances on the Collateral,  except for (A) the Permitted Encumbrances,  (B)
the liens and  security  interests  expressly  granted to Lender,  and (C) liens
against Purchasers and in favor of a Borrower or the Time-Share  Association for
payment of assessments or for amounts due under any executed  Time-Share Project
Consumer  Documents;  (iii) sell, convey,  lease,  transfer or dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets to another entity provided,  however,  that this
section  (iii)  shall  not be any  more  restrictive  to the  Borrower  than  is
permitted  by section 4.10 of the  Indenture;  or (iv) permit or suffer to exist
any change in the legal or  beneficial  ownership  of Teton or any change in the
power to control it,  Without  limiting  Lender's right to withhold its approval
for other reasons,  as a condition to approval of any lien, security interest or
other charge upon any of the Collateral, Lender may require that the third party
execute a subordination agreement satisfactory to Lender and provide


27

Quiet Enjoyment Rights to owners of Time-Share Interests.

(d) No Sales  Activities  Prior  to  Approval.  Borrower  will not sell any
Time-Share   Interest  or  offer  any  Time-Share   Interest  for  sale  in  any
jurisdiction,  unless:  (i) Borrower  has  delivered to Lender true and complete
copies  of  the  Minimum  Required   Time-Share   Approvals   required  in  such
jurisdiction for its proposed conduct and all other evidence  required by Lender
that  Borrower has complied  with all Legal  Requirements  of such  jurisdiction
governing  its proposed  conduct;  and (ii) Borrower has delivered to Lender the
Time-Share  Program  Consumer  Documents and the  Time-Share  Program  Governing
Documents which Borrower will be using in connection with the Time-Share Project
and the sale or offering for sale of Time-Share  Interests in such  jurisdiction
and such  documents  have been approved by Lender,  which  approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(e) No  Modification  of  Receivables  Collateral  or Payments by Borrower.
Borrower will not cancel or materially modify, or consent to or acquiesce in any
material  modification to any Reservation  Agreements which  constitute  Working
Capital  Loan  Collateral  or  waive  the  timely  performance  of the  material
obligations  of the Purchaser  under such  Reservation  Agreement.  In addition,
Borrower will not cancel or materially modify, or consent to or acquiesce in any
material modification (including, without limitation, any change in the interest
rate or amount,  frequency or number of payments) to, or solicit the  prepayment
of, any Instrument  which  constitutes  part of the (i)  Receivables  Collateral
(except for  solicitations  by the  Borrower  which  result in  prepayment  of a
particular Instrument in exchange for a discount not exceeding five percent (5%)
of the principal balance of such Instrument); or waive the timely performance of
the material  obligations  of the  Purchaser  under any such  Instrument  or its
security; or release the security for any such Instrument. Borrower will not pay
or advance  directly  or  indirectly  for the account of any  Purchaser  any sum
required to be  deposited  or owing by the  Purchaser  either under any Purchase
Contract or Reservation Agreement or under any Instrument which constitutes part
of the Receivables Collateral

(f) No  Modification of Time-Share  Documents.  Borrower will not cancel or
materially modify, or consent to or suffer to exist any cancellation or material
modification  of any  Time-Share  Program  Consumer  Document or any  Time-Share
Program  Governing  Document  without the prior written consent of Lender,  such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(g)  Maintenance  of Larger  Tract.  To the extent  either  the  Time-Share
Project is part of a larger common  ownership  regime or planned  development or
parts of  buildings  in which Units are  located are not part of the  Time-Share
Project,  Borrower  will not  permit  common  expenses  to be  allocated  to the
Time-Share Project in an unreasonably disproportionate manner.

(h) OPC Leases.  Borrower shall not enter into any  "Off-Premises  Contact"
leases or other  similar  off-site  agreements  with  respect to the  Time-Share
Project  without the prior  approval of Lender as to the terms and conditions of
such  leases  and   agreements   and  unless  such  leases  and  agreements  are
collaterally  assigned  to  Lender  as  further  security  for the  payment  and
Performance of the Obligations  pursuant to a Collateral  Assignment of Lessee's
Interest  in  Lease  (the  "Assignment  of  Leases"),  in a form  and  substance
satisfactory  to Lender and shall cause such Assignment of Leases to be recorded
in the  appropriate  real estate  records  provided that the landlord under such
lease  consents  to such  recordation.  Borrower  shall use its best  efforts to
obtain a  consent  from the  landlord  of such  lease  within  thirty  days (30)
following the execution of the Assignment of Leases.

(i)  Minimum  Sales  Price.  Without the prior  written  consent of Lender,
Borrower  shall not sell the particular  Time-Share  Interest for an amount less
than the amount set forth in the  minimum  price  schedule  delivered  to Lender
pursuant to paragraph 4.1(c), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit M.

6.3  Survival of  Covenants.  The  covenants  contained in this Article 6 are in
addition to, and not in derogation of, the covenants  contained elsewhere in the
Loan Documents and shall be deemed to be made and reaffirmed prior to the making
of each Advance.

in Teton's name all  applications,  certificates,  notices and other instruments
and give all instructions and communications  which may be required or permitted
by the Principal Work-Related Items, other Contracts,  Intangibles, Licenses and
Permits,  as determined by Lender in its sole and absolute judgment;  (g) do any
and  every  act with  respect  to the  Completion  of the  Work,  the  Principal
Work-Related  Items and the other Contracts,  Intangibles,  Licenses and Permits
which   Borrower   may  do  on  its  behalf;   (h)  employ   such   contractors,
subcontractors,   suppliers,   agents,   attorneys,   architects,   accountants,
appraisers,  security  guards  and  inspectors  as  Lender  may in its  sole and
absolute  judgment deem  necessary or desirable to  accomplish  any of the above
purposes; and (i) receive, collect, open and read all mail of Teton for the sole
purpose  of  obtaining  all  items   pertaining  to  the  Work,   the  Principal
Work-Related Items and the other Contracts,  Intangibles,  Licenses and Permits.
In connection  with the foregoing,  Teton hereby appoints Lender as Teton's true
and lawful  attorney-in-fact,  with full power of substitution and such power of
attorney  shall be deemed to be a power  coupled with an interest that cannot be
revoked  for  any  reason  prior  to the  Performance  by  Teton  of any and all
Obligations under the Loan Documents.

7.3 Application of Proceeds During an Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything
in the Loan  Documents to the contrary,  while an Event of Default  exists,  any
cash received and retained by Lender in connection  with the  Collateral  may be
applied to payment of the Obligations in the manner provided in paragraph 7.5.

7.4 Uniform Commercial Code Remedies; Sale; Assembly of Collateral.

(a) UCC Remedies;  Sale of Collateral.  Lender shall have all of the rights
and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform  Commercial  Code of the State
of Arizona and all other  rights and  remedies  accorded  to a Secured  Party in
equity or at law.  Any  notice of sale or other  disposition  of the  Collateral
given not less than ten (10)  Business  Days  prior to such  proposed  action in
connection  with the exercise of Lender's  rights and remedies shall  constitute
reasonable  and fair notice of such  action.  Lender may postpone or adjourn any
such sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place of sale stated
on the notice of sale or by announcement  of any adjourned  sale,  without being
required  to give a further  notice  of sale.  Any such sale may be for cash or,
unless  prohibited by applicable  law, upon such credit or installment as Lender
may  determine.  Borrower  shall be credited  with the net proceeds of such sale
only when such proceeds are actually  received by Lender in good current  funds.
Despite the consummation of any such sale,  Borrower shall remain liable for any
deficiency on the Obligations which remains outstanding following such sale. All
net proceeds  recovered  pursuant to a sale shall be applied in accordance  with
the provisions of paragraph 7.5.

(b)  Lender's  Right to Execute  Conveyances.  Lender  may,  in the name of
Borrower or in its own name, make and execute all  conveyances,  assignments and
transfers of the  Collateral  sold in  connection  with the exercise of Lender's
rights and remedies; and Lender is hereby appointed Borrower's  attorney-in-fact
for

31
<PAGE>


this purpose, which appointment is coupled with an interest.

(c) Obligation to Assemble Collateral. Upon request of Lender when an Event
of Default exists,  Borrower shall assemble the Collateral and make it available
to Lender at a time and place  designated  by  Lender,  if it is not  already in
Lender's possession.

7.5 Application of Proceeds.  The proceeds of any sale of all or any part of the
Collateral  made in connection with the exercise of Lender's rights and remedies
shall be applied in the following order of priorities;  first, to the payment of
all costs and expenses of such sale,  including without  limitation,  reasonable
compensation to Lender and its agents,  attorneys' fees, and all other expenses,
liabilities and advances  incurred or made by Lender,  its agents and attorneys,
in  connection  with such sale,  and any other  unreimbursed  expenses for which
Lender may be reimbursed pursuant to the Loan Documents;  second, to the payment
of all late charges  required by the Loan  Documents to be paid by Borrower,  in
such order and manner as Lender shall in its discretion determine; third, to the
payment of the  Obligations,  in such  order and  manner as Lender  shall in its
discretion determine,  with no amounts applied to payment of principal until all
interest  has been  paid;  fourth,  to the other  Obligations  in such order and
manner as Lender  may  determine;  and last,  to the  payment to  Borrower,  its
successors or assigns,  or to whosoever may be lawfully  entitled to receive the
same, or as a court of competent  jurisdiction  may direct,  of any surplus then
remaining from such proceeds.

7.6  Lender's  Right to Perform.  Lender  may,  at its  option,  and without any
obligation to do so, pay,  perform and discharge any and all obligations  agreed
to be paid or Performed in the Loan  Documents by Borrower or any surety for the
Performance of the  Obligations if (a) such person fails to do so and (b) (i) an
Event of Default  exists and at least five (5)  Business  Days'  notice has been
given to such person of Lender's intention to take such action,  (ii) the action
taken by Lender  involves  obtaining  insurance  which such person has failed to
maintain in accordance with the Loan Documents or to deliver  evidence  thereof,
or (iii) in the  opinion  of  Lender,  such  action  must be  taken  because  an
emergency  exists or to preserve any of the  Collateral  or its value.  For such
purposes Lender may use the proceeds of the Collateral.  All amounts expended by
Lender  in so doing or in  exercising  its  remedies  under  the Loan  Documents
following  an Event of Default  shall become part of the  Obligations,  shall be
immediately  due and payable by Borrower to Lender upon  demand,  and shall bear
interest at the Default Rate from the dates of such expenditures until paid.

7.7  Non-Exclusive  Remedies.  No remedy in any Loan  Document  conferred  on or
reserved to Lender is intended to be  exclusive of any other remedy or remedies,
but each and every such remedy shall be  cumulative  and shall be in addition to
every other remedy given under any Loan Document or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity.  No delay or omission to exercise  any right or power shall be
construed  to be a waiver of or  acquiescence  to any default or a waiver of any
right or power;  and every  such right and power may be  exercised  from time to
time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

7.8  Waiver  of  Marshalling.  Borrower,  for  itself  and for all who may claim
through or under it, hereby  expressly waives and releases all right to have the
Collateral, or any part of the Collateral,  marshalled on any foreclosure,  sale
or other enforcement of Lender's rights and remedies.

7.9  Attorney-in-Fact.  For the purpose of  exercising  its rights and  remedies
under paragraphs 7.2(e) and 7.6, Lender may do so in Borrower's name or its name
and is  hereby  appointed  as  Borrower's  attorney-in-fact  to take any and all
actions  in  Borrower's  name  and/or on  Borrower's  behalf as Lender  may deem
necessary  or  appropriate  in its  discretion  in the  accomplishment  of  such
purposes, which appointment is coupled with an interest.

8. COSTS AND EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 Costs and Expenses.

8.1.1  Borrower will pay on demand any and all costs and expenses  incurred

32
<PAGE>

taxes.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing,  if a  bankruptcy
proceeding  is  commenced  by or against  Borrower or  otherwise  involving  the
Collateral,  Lender  shall,  to the extent not already  provided for herein,  be
entitled to recover, and Borrower shall be obligated to pay, Lender's attorneys'
fees  and  costs  incurred  in  connection   with:  any   determination  of  the
applicability  of the  bankruptcy  laws to the  terms of the Loan  Documents  or
Lender's  rights  thereunder;  any attempt by Lender to enforce or preserve  its
rights under the bankruptcy laws or to prevent Borrower or any other person from
seeking to deny Lender its rights  thereunder;  any effort by Lender to protect,
preserve or enforce its rights against the Collateral,  or seeking  authority to
modify the  automatic  stay of 11 U.S.C.  Section  362 or  otherwise  seeking to
engage in such  protection,  preservation or enforcement;  or any  proceeding(s)
arising under the bankruptcy  laws, or arising in or related to a case under the
bankruptcy laws.

8.2 Indemnification. Borrower will INDEMNIFY, PROTECT, HOLD HARMLESS, and defend
Lender,  FPSI  and  their  respective   successors,   assigns  and  shareholders
(including  corporate  shareholders),  and the directors,  officers,  employees,
servants and agents of the  foregoing,  for,  from and against:  (a) any and all
liability,  damage,  penalties,  or fines,  loss, costs or expenses  (including,
without limitation,  court costs and attorneys' fees), claims,  demands,  suits,
proceedings (whether civil or criminal), orders, judgments, penalties, fines and
other sanctions  whatsoever  asserted  against it and arising from or brought in
connection  with the Time-Share  Project,  the  Collateral,  Lender's  status by
virtue of the Loan  Documents,  creation of liens and  security  interests,  the
terms of the Loan Documents or the transactions  related thereto,  or any act or
omission of  Borrower  or an Agent,  or their  respective  employees  or agents,
whether  actual or alleged  unless  such act or  omission  is caused by Lender's
gross negligence or willful  misconduct or unless such act or omission  occurred
at a time when Borrower did not  effectively  control the ownership or operation
of the  Time-Share  Project or the  Collateral  as a result of the  exercise  by
Lender of any of its rights or remedies hereunder;  and (b) any and all brokers'
commissions  or  finders'  fees or other  costs of similar  type by any party in
connection with the Receivables Loan,  Construction Loan and the Working Capital
Loan.  On  written  request  by a person or other  entity  covered  by the above
agreement of indemnity, Borrower will undertake, at its own cost and expense, on
behalf of such  indemnitee,  using counsel  satisfactory to the indemnitee,  the
defense of any legal action or  proceeding  to which such person or entity shall
be a party. At Lender's option,  Lender may at Borrower's  expense  prosecute or
defend any action  involving the  priority,  validity or  enforceability  of the
Collateral.  FPSI is hereby  expressly  made a  third-party  beneficiary  of the
indemnity obligations of Borrower contained in this paragraph 8.2 and shall have
the right to enforce such  indemnity  obligations  against  Borrower in the same
manner as if FPSI were a party to this Agreement.

rights and  obligations of Lender and Borrower with respect to the  Construction
Loan,  the  Receivables  Loan and the Working  Capital  Loan.  No  modification,
variation,  termination,   discharge,  abandonment  or  waiver  of  any  of  the
provisions or conditions of the Loan Documents  shall be valid unless in writing

by such action. The Loan Documents supersede any and all prior  representations,
warranties  and/or  inducements,  written or oral,  heretofore made by Lender or
Borrower and concerning this transaction, including any proposal letters.

9.3 Powers  Coupled with an Interest.  The powers and agency  hereby  granted by
Borrower are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable  until the Obligations
have been paid in full and are granted as cumulative to Lender's  other remedies
for collection and enforcement of the Obligations.

9.4  Counterparts;  Facsimile  Signatures.  Any Loan Document may be executed in
counterpart,  and any  number of copies of such Loan  Document  which  have been
executed  by all  parties  shall  constitute  one (1)  original.  Delivery of an
executed  counterpart of any Loan Document by telefacsimile  shall be equally as
effective as delivery of a manually executed  counterpart of such Loan Document.
Any  party   delivering  an  executed   counterpart  of  any  Loan  Document  by
telefacsimile  shall also deliver a manually  executed  counterpart of such Loan
Document,  but the failure to deliver a manually executed  counterpart shall not

under the Loan Documents shall be in writing,  and shall be deemed effective (a)
upon hand  delivery,  if hand  delivered or (b) two (2) Business Days after such

person  or  other  entity  shall  be  deemed a third  party  beneficiary  of any
provision of the Loan Documents.

9.7  Severability.  If any provision of any Loan Document is held to be invalid,
illegal or  unenforceable  under present or future laws, the legality,  validity
and  enforceability of the remaining  provisions of the Loan Documents shall not
in any way be  affected  or  impaired  thereby.  In lieu of each  such  illegal,
invalid or  unenforceable  provision,  there shall be added to the Loan Document
affected,  a provision that is legal,  valid and  enforceable  and as similar in
terms to such illegal, invalid and unenforceable provision as may be possible.

9.8  Time  of  Essence.  Time  is of  the  essence  in  the  Performance  of the
Obligations.

9.9 Miscellaneous.  All headings are inserted for convenience only and shall not
affect  any  construction  or  interpretation  of  the  Loan  Documents.  Unless
otherwise  indicated,  all  references  in a Loan  Document to clauses and other
subdivisions   refer  to  the  corresponding   paragraphs,   clauses  and  other
subdivisions  of the Loan  Document;  the words  "herein,"  "hereof,"  "hereto,"
"hereunder"  and words of similar  import refer to the Loan Documents as a whole
and not to any particular paragraph, clause or other subdivision;  and reference
to a numbered or lettered  subdivision of an Article or paragraph  shall include
relevant  matter within the Article or paragraph  which is applicable to but not
within  such  numbered or  lettered  subdivision.  All  Schedules  and  Exhibits
referred to in this Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.
Whenever the words  "including",  "include",  or "includes" are used in the Loan
Documents,  they shall be  interpreted in a  non-exclusive  manner as though the
words, "without limitation," immediately followed the same.

9.10 CHOICE OF LAW. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE  EXPRESSLY  PROVIDED  THEREIN,  THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS, DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES THERETO SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN  ACCORDANCE  WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF

WITHOUT  LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING,  HEREBY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT
TO ASSERT BY WAY OF MOTION,  DEFENSE OR  OTHERWISE  IN ANY SUCH SUIT,  ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ANY CLAIM THAT IT IS NOT PERSONALLY  SUBJECT TO THE  JURISDICTION  OF
THE ABOVE-NAMED COURTS, THAT SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IS


34
<PAGE>


BROUGHT  IN AN  INCONVENIENT  FORUM OR THAT THE  VENUE OF SUCH  SUIT,  ACTION OR

<PAGE>


9.14  Compliance  With  Applicable  Usury Law.  It is the intent of the  parties
hereto to comply with the Applicable Usury Law. Accordingly, notwithstanding any
provisions  to the  contrary in the Loan  Documents,  in no event shall the Loan
Documents  require the payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of
the maximum contract rate permitted by the Applicable Usury Law.

9.15 NO RELATIONSHIP  WITH  PURCHASERS.  LENDER DOES NOT HEREBY ASSUME AND SHALL
HAVE  NO  RESPONSIBILITY,   OBLIGATION  OR  LIABILITY  TO  PURCHASERS,  LENDER'S
RELATIONSHIP  BEING THAT ONLY OF A  CREDITOR  WHO HAS TAKEN AN  ASSIGNMENT  FROM
BORROWER  OF  THE  INSTRUMENTS  IN  ORDER  TO  FACILITATE   PERFORMANCE  OF  THE
OBLIGATIONS.  EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW AND FOR FILINGS MADE WITH THE SECURITIES
& EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STOCK EXCHANGE ON WHICH BORROWER'S STOCK IS TRADED,
BORROWER WILL NOT, AT ANY TIME, USE THE NAME OF OR MAKE REFERENCE TO LENDER WITH
RESPECT  TO  THE  TIME-SHARE  PROJECT,  THE  SALE  OF  TIME-SHARE  INTERESTS  OR
OTHERWISE, WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF LENDER.

9.16 NO JOINT VENTURE. THE RELATIONSHIP OF BORROWER AND LENDER IS THAT OF DEBTOR
AND  CREDITOR,  AND IT IS NOT THE INTENTION OF EITHER OF SUCH PARTIES BY THIS OR
ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT  BEING EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE  CONSTRUCTION  LOAN,
THE RECEIVABLES LOAN OR THE WORKING CAPITAL LOAN TO ESTABLISH A PARTNERSHIP, AND
THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE CONSTRUED TO BE PARTNERS
OR JOINT VENTURERS.

9.17  Standards  Applied to  Lender's  Actions.  Unless  otherwise  specifically
stipulated  elsewhere  in the Loan  Documents,  if a matter  is left in the Loan
Documents to the decision, right, requirement, request, determination, judgment,
opinion, approval, consent, waiver, satisfaction,  acceptance, agreement, option
or discretion of Lender,  its  employees,  Lender's  counsel or any agent for or
contractor of Lender, such action shall be deemed to be exercisable by Lender or
such other person in its sole and absolute discretion and according to standards
established in its sole and absolute discretion. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, "option" and "discretion" shall be implied by use of the words
"if"  or  "may."  However,   whenever  the  Loan  Documents  contain  the  terms
"reasonably   satisfactory  to  Lender",   "reasonably  determined  by  Lender",
"reasonably acceptable to Lender", "reasonable consent of Lender", "Lender shall
reasonably elect",  "Lender shall reasonably  request,"  "reasonably approved by
Lender" or similar terms wherein the word reasonable or a derivative  thereof is
used with regard to an action of Lender;  (i) such terms shall mean satisfactory
to, at the  election  of,  determined  by,  acceptable  to or  requested  by, as
applicable,  Lender  in its sole (but  reasonably  exercised)  discretion  under
standards  applicable  to  commercial  lenders  under  the laws of the  State of
Arizona;  and (ii) it is the  intention of the parties to permit  Lender a broad
latitude in which to exercise its  discretion,  acknowledging  that,  while such
discretion may not be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously, it may be exercised
conservatively for Lender's protection and benefit. By way of illustration,  and
not of limitation,  it shall not be unreasonable  for Lender,  in exercising its
discretion,  to make conservative  assumptions regarding the possible outcome of
future events.

9.18 Meaning of Subordination.  Any subordination required to be given under the
Loan Documents to Lender shall include the  subordination of and the deferral of
the right to receive  payments  on the  subordinated  obligations  except to the
extent expressly  permitted in this Agreement;  the remittances to Lender of all
prohibited payments received by the third party; the subordination of all liens,
security  interests,  assignments and other  encumbrances and claims held by the
subordinating  party  on or  against  any of  Borrower's  property  to  Lender's
interest (whenever  acquired) in such property;  and an agreement on the part of
the third party not to exercise  any  remedies  against  Borrower so long as all
obligations under the Loan Documents have not been fully satisfied.

9.19 Scope of Reimbursable  Attorney's Fees. As used in the Loan Documents,  the
term  "attorneys'  fees" includes the reasonable  fees of attorneys  licensed to
practice law in any  jurisdiction,  law clerks,  paralegals,  investigators  and
others not admitted to the bar but performing  services under the supervision of
a licensed attorney, and the expenses (including, without limitation, normal and
customary  charges for telecopy and  photocopy  services and clerical  overtime)
incurred  by them in the  performance  of  their  services.  As used in the Loan
Documents,  attorneys'  fees incurred by Lender in the enforcement of any remedy
or  covenant  include,  without  limitation,  attorneys'  fees  incurred  in any
foreclosure of the Security  Documents,  in protecting or sustaining the lien or
priority of the Collateral,  or in any proceeding arising from or connected with
any such matter, including any bankruptcy, receivership, injunction


37
<PAGE>


or other  similar  proceeding,  or any appeal from or petition for review of any
such matter, and with or without litigation.

9.20 Publicity.  Lender is hereby authorized to issue appropriate press releases
and to cause a tombstone to be published  announcing  the  consummation  of this
transaction  and  the  aggregate  amount  thereof.  Borrower  consents  to  such
advertising  and  authorizes  Lender to use  Borrower's  name,  logo,  insignia,
descriptive art work, trade name, trademark, or other similar material,  whether
or not  protected  by  copyright  (or  otherwise),  in any  such  advertisement.
Borrower  shall,  at its  expense,  erect a sign upon the Real  Property  within
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date indicating that Lender is the source
of the financing for the  construction  of the Time-Share  Project which sign to
contain  Lender's  "Logo" and be subject to the  reasonable  approval of Lender.
Lender agrees to supply Borrower with "camera-ready"  artwork for inclusion with
such sign.

9.21 Permitted Contests.  Nothwithstanding anything in the Loan Documents to the
contrary,  after  prior  written  notice to Lender,  Borrower at its expense may
contest,  by appropriate legal or other proceedings  conducted in good faith and
with due  diligence,  the  amount  or  validity  of any tax,  Imposition,  Legal
Requirement or any monetary lien on the Collateral,  so long as: (a) in the case
of an unpaid Imposition or lien, such proceedings suspend the collection thereof
from Borrower and the  Collateral,  and shall not interfere  with the payment of
any monies due under the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Security
Documents;  (b) none of the  Collateral  is, in the  judgment of Lender,  in any
imminent  danger of being sold,  forfeited  or lost;  (c) in the case of a Legal
Requirement,  neither  Borrower  nor  Lender  is in any  danger  of any civil or
criminal  liability  for  failure  to comply  therewith;  and (d)  Borrower  has
furnished  such  security,  if any, as may be required in the  proceedings or as
Lender reasonably  requests up to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the amount
in controversy.

9.22  Reliance.  Lender's  examination,  inspection,  or receipt of  information
pertaining to Borrower,  the Collateral or the  Time-Share  Project shall not in
any way be deemed to reduce the full  scope and  protection  of the  warranties,
representations and Obligations contained in the Loan Documents.

9.23 Joint and Several. All of the Obligations,  covenants,  representations and
warranties  of  Borrower  in any of the Loan  Documents  shall be the  joint and
several  Obligations,  covenants,  representations and warranties of each entity
constituting Borrower,  except to the extent otherwise set forth to the contrary
including, but not limited to, Section S.9 of the Schedule.  Although Lender and
Borrower  intend that each  entity  constituting  Borrower  shall be jointly and
severally liable for all  Obligations,  to the extent that this Agreement or the
other Loan  Documents may be determined to secure  indebtedness  of any Borrower
for which any other Borrower is not primarily  liable,  each Borrower  expressly
waives the benefit of any and all defenses  available  to a  guarantor,  surety,
endorser or  accommodation  party  dependent on an obligor's  character as such.
Without  limiting the  generality of the foregoing,  each such other  Borrower's
liability  hereunder  shall not be affected or impaired in any way by any of the
following  acts or things  (which Lender is hereby  expressly  authorized to do,
omit or suffer from time to time without notice to or consent of anyone):

(i)  any  acceptance  of  collateral  security,  guarantors,  accommodation
parties or sureties for any or all Obligations;

(ii) any extension or renewal of any Obligations (whether or not for longer
than  the  original  period)  or any  modification  of the  interest  rate,
maturity or other terms of the Obligations;

(iii) any waiver or indulgence  granted to any  Borrower,  and any delay or
lack of diligence in the enforcement of any or all Obligations  owed by any
Borrower;

(iv) any full or partial  release of,  compromise  or  settlement  with, or
agreement  not to sue, any Borrower or the Guarantor or other person liable
on any Obligations;

(v) any release,  surrender,  cancellation or other discharge of any or all
Obligations  of Borrower or the  acceptance of any instrument in renewal or
substitution for any instrument evidencing any Obligations;

(vi) any failure to obtain collateral security (including rights of setoff)
for any  Obligations  or to see to the proper or  sufficient  creation  and
perfection  thereof,  or to establish the priority thereof, or to preserve,
protect,  insure, care for, exercise or enforce any collateral security for
any Obligations;

(vii) any  modification,  alteration,  substitution,  exchange,  surrender,
cancellation, termination, release or other change, impairment, limitation,
loss or discharge of any collateral security for any Obligations;

(viii)  any  assignment,  sale,  pledge  or  other  transfer  of any of the
Obligations owed by any Borrower; or


38
<PAGE>


(ix) any manner,  order or method of application of any payments or credits
on any Obligations.

Each  Borrower  waives all  rights  that it may now have or  hereafter  acquire,
whether by  subrogation,  contribution,  reimbursement,  recourse,  exoneration,
contract or otherwise,  to recover from any other  Borrower or from any property
of any other  Borrower  any sums paid under this  Agreement.  No  Borrower  will
exercise or enforce any right of  contribution to recover any such sums from any
person who is a  co-obligor  with any  Borrower or a guarantor  or surety of the
Obligations  or from any  property of any such person or entity until all of the
Obligations shall have been fully paid and discharged.

9.24 Consideration.  Each of the entities  comprising Borrower  acknowledges the
Lender  would  not make  the  Receivables  Loan,  the  Construction  Loan or the
Working-Capital Loan contemplated hereby unless each of such entities (a) became
a party to this  Agreement  and the other  Loan  Documents,  (b)  subject to the
provisions of Section S.9 of the Schedule  became  jointly and severally  liable
for the payment and  performance of all of the  Obligations,  and (c) granted to
Lender a security interest,  subject to Permitted Encumbrances,  in all items of
Collateral  owned by each  Borrower.  Although  each of the entities  comprising
Borrower  maintains its separate legal  existence and operates as a distinct and
separate entity, such entities have historically engaged in substantial business
with each other and have operated, and intend to continue operating,  as a joint
and consolidated  entity for financial planning and cash management purposes and
for purposes of achieving certain business operation  efficiencies.  Each of the
entities   comprising   Borrower  will  therefore  benefit  from  the  financing
arrangement and accommodations made by Lender under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.

materials required by Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.21, 7.06, and Article 8 of the
Indenture),  and (ii) it will not amend or modify the Indenture without the
prior written  consent of the Lender and any such amendment or modification
to the Indenture made without the prior written consent of Lender shall not
be binding upon Lender or affect the  Financial  Covenants.  The  Financial
Covenants shall not be deemed amended by any amendments or modifications to
the Indenture  made without the prior written  consent of Lender.  Further,
Raintree  agrees to cause the Issuer to promptly  (but in any event  within
three (3) days after the  Issuer's  receipt of the same)  supply the Lender
with a true and  complete  copy of any  notice  sent to the  Issuers  under
Section 6.01 of the  Indenture,  or any other notice  alleging a default by
the Issuers under the Indenture.

S.5 Lender agrees that simultaneously with the payment of a release payment (the
"Construction  Loan Release  Payment") in an amount equal to sixty-four  percent
(64%) of the greater of: (a) the amount set forth on the attached  Exhibit M, as
pertaining  to such  Time-Share  Interest  or (b) the  actual  sales  price of a
Time-Share  Interest sold, Lender will release the Time-Share  interest sold and
all  proceeds  and  products  thereof,  from the lien of the  Mortgage.  No such
release of a Time-Share  Interest and the proceeds and products thereof from the
lien of the  Mortgage  shall  impair or affect  Lender's  remaining  lien on the
balance of the property  described in the Mortgage or any term or  provisions of
the Security Documents as they pertain to that portion of the property described
in the  Mortgage  that has not  been  released  from  the lien of the  Mortgage.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Lender shall have no obligation to release any
Time-Share  Interest from the lien of the Mortgage  during the continuance of an
Event of  Default  or  Incipient  Default.  The cost of  recording  any  release
document  shall be borne by  Borrower.  A  payment  equal to the  amount  of the
Advance made against such Working Capital Loan Eligible Instrument shall be made
to Lender (the  "Working  Capital Loan  Mandatory  Payment") at such time as the
Unit which is the subject matter of the Working Capital Loan Eligible Instrument
has been  Completed  and the Escrow Agent has released from Escrow the cash down
payments  associated  with the Working  Capital Loan  Eligible  Instrument.  The
Borrower  shall  irrevocably  instruct  the Escrow  Agent to remit such  payment
directly to Lender.

S.6 The  obligation  of  Lender to make  advances  of the  Construction  Loan is

Work-Related  Advance  shall  be  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  all of the
following conditions and limitations:

A.  Work-Related  Advances shall be made no more frequently than monthly as
the Work  progresses  and each such  monthly  disbursement  shall be based  upon
actual  completed work in place rather than upon percentage of completion.  Each
Advance shall be in an amount not to exceed ninety percent (90%) of expenditures
for labor performed and materials  supplied in connection with the  construction
of the  Improvements  for the  period  immediately  proceeding  that  particular
Advance;  provided,  however,  that  "Reimbursable  Costs",  as set forth in the
General  Contract shall be in the amount equal to one hundred  percent (100%) of
such  Reimbursable  Costs,  in  accordance  with Section  7.1.7.7 of the General
Contract.

B.  Lender  shall  have  no  obligation  to  make  a  Work-Related  Advance
(including,  without  limitation,  the  initial  Work-Related  Advance)  if  the
undisbursed  portion of the  Construction  Loan (or, in reference to the initial
Work-Related  Advance,  the full  Construction  Loan  amount)  is less  than the
remaining  costs of Completion  until  Borrower has deposited with the Lender an
amount  equal  to the  estimated  Uncovered  Cost  of the  Work  (the  "Required
Completion Deposit Assurances").

C. Lender shall  withhold from each  Work-Related  Advance an amount not to
exceed ten percent (10%) of such costs,  provided,  that no such retainage shall
apply to any  reimbursements  to be paid to the General  Contractor  pursuant to
Section 7.1.7.7 of the General Contract. The retainage shall be funded by Lender
to, or at the direction of, Borrower upon Borrower's  written  certification  to
Lender  that  all  "punch  list   items"  have  been   resolved  to   Borrower's
satisfaction,    accompanied    by   a   certificate    from   the    Borrower's
Architect/Engineer and Lender's Inspector certifying to the same, and subject to
Lender's approval of such items.

D. Each Work-Related Advance shall be conditioned upon Lender's receipt and
approval of all items required to be delivered by Borrower pursuant to Exhibit I
hereof.

E.  Work-Related  Advances  shall be subject to the receipt of Title Policy
endorsements   required  pursuant  to  the  Construction   Covenants,   trailing
mechanics'  and  materialmen's  lien  waivers on a thirty (30) day basis and any
surveys required pursuant to the Construction Covenants.

F.  Lender  will  make  the  initial  Work-Related  Advance  and the  final
Work-Related  Advance  directly  to the agent of the Title  Company  (the "Title
Agent")  if  necessary  in order for  Lender to obtain  the Title  Policy or any
endorsement thereto. Other Work-Related Advances may, at Borrower's election, be
made directly to Borrower  provided that all conditions  precedent to the making
of an Advance have been satisfied.

G. Lender shall have the right to approve or disapprove  disbursements  for
stored or ordered goods.  Without limiting the generality of such right,  Lender
may  condition  its  approval of  disbursements  of the Loan for  payments of or
deposits  upon  stored or  ordered  goods  upon  Lender's  prior  receipt of the
following:

(i) Evidence reasonably  satisfactory to Lender that such goods are covered
by the  Insurance  Policies  required to be delivered  pursuant to the Loan
Agreement;

(ii)  Evidence  reasonably  satisfactory  to Lender from the vendor of such
goods that,  upon full payment to the vendor,  ownership of such goods will
vest in the name of  Borrower  free and clear of any liens or claims of the
vendor or any other third party;

(iii) (a) Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the goods are and
upon disbursement  shall be stored upon the Real Property in a manner which
is  adequate to protect the goods  against  theft and damage and  otherwise
satisfactory to Lender; or

evidence (including the original warehouse receipt)  reasonably  satisfactory to
Lender  that  the  goods  are  being  fabricated  or  sold  by a  reputable  and
creditworthy vendor, that the goods are being or will be stored in a

bonded warehouse or storage yard unless the goods are still being fabricated and
that the  warehouse  or storage  yard has been  notified  of  Lender's  security
interest.

H.  Lender  shall have been  provided  with paid  invoices  relating to the
construction  of the  Time-Share  Project  for all Work  through the date of the
previous Work-Related Advance.

I. No  intervening  matters  shall have  affected  the priority of Lender's
Mortgage.

J.  Lender  shall have been  provided  with a  certification  by  Borrower,
Teton's  supervising  architect,  the General  Contractor and Lender's Inspector
that:  (a) all Work  theretofore  performed  has been  performed in  substantial
accordance with the Plans;  (b) all  governmental  licenses and permits required
for the Improvements as then completed have been obtained;  (c) the Improvements
as then completed do not violate and if further completed in accordance with the
Plans will not violate any law,  ordinance,  rule or regulation or any covenant,
condition or  restriction  affecting the Time-Share  Project;  (d) the remaining
undisbursed proceeds of the Loan are sufficient to pay for the completion of the
Improvements;  and (e) the Work-Related Advance is in an amount not in excess of

required by any governmental  authority having  jurisdiction over the Time-Share
Project have been completed with results satisfactory to that authority

the best of  Borrower's  Knowledge,  there  shall  exist no Event of  Default or
Incipient Default as of the date of any such proposed Work-Related Advance.

M.  Lender  shall  receive  copies of any  building  permits  that are then
required to be obtained by Borrower.

S.8.A.  Borrower  represents  and  warrants  to Lender  that  prior to that
recordation of the Mortgage,  no services,  work,  equipment or materials of any
kind that may give rise to any mechanics or similar  statutory lien,  including,
without limitation,  site work, clearing,  grubbing,  draining or fencing of the
Real  Property  were  performed or  commenced on the Real  Property or otherwise
provided in connection  with the Work,  except to the extent that such services,
work, equipment, materials have been fully disclosed in writing to Lender and to
Title Insurer and the Title Policy insures the priority of the Mortgage over all
mechanics and similar liens.

B.  Borrower  represents  and warrants to Lender that all utility  services
(including  water,  storm  and  sanitary  sewer,  gas,  electric  and  telephone
facilities and garbage removal) necessary for the Completion of the Work and the
intended use of the Real  Property as a Time-Share  Project are available to the
Real  Property (or will be upon  Completion);  that,  to the best of  Borrower's
Knowledge,  the suppliers of such  utilities have the capacity to serve the Real
Property  and are  committed  to supply such  utilities  in such  amounts as are
required upon Completion; and all fees and deposits due to the suppliers of such
utilities have been paid current or amounts adequate for such purposes have been
reserved in the Budget.

C. Lender shall  employ an  independent  architect  or engineer  ("Lender's
Inspector") to: (a) review the Plans, the Budget and the Construction Contracts;
(b) make periodic  inspections  of the Real Property and the Work so that Lender
may monitor  whether  Borrower is in compliance with the terms and conditions of
this  Agreement  with  respect  to  completion  of the Work;  and (c) review and
approve the monthly draw request, perform an analysis of the anticipated cost of
the Work, and certify that each Work-Related Advance Request is not in excess of
the Work  completed and the amount to which Borrower is entitled under the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The cost of retaining Lender's Inspector shall
be borne by Borrower.

(1) Lender may require an inspection of the Work by Lender's  Inspector (a)
prior to each  Work-Related  Advance;  (b)  monthly or more  frequently  if
deemed  necessary by Lender during the course of  construction of the Work;
(c) upon  Completion of the Work;  and (d) at such other time as Lender may
deem  necessary due to actual or suspected  non-compliance  with the Plans,
Construction Contract(s), the Loan Documents,

10
<PAGE>

any  law,   regulation  or  private   restriction,   sound   architectural,
engineering  or  construction   principles  or  commonly   accepted  safety
standards or  Borrower's  failure to satisfy the  requirements  of the Loan
Documents.

(2) Lender  shall have no duty to  supervise  or to review and  inspect the
Plans, the Construction Contract(s),  any budget proposed to be the Budget,
the construction of the Work, or any books and records pertaining  thereto.
Any inspection  made by Lender shall be for the sole purpose of determining
whether the  Obligations  are being  performed and of  preserving  Lender's
rights under the Loan Documents. If Lender, or Lender's Inspector acting on
behalf of Lender,  should  review or inspect  the Plans,  the  Construction
Contract(s),  the  Budget,  the  construction  of the Work or any books and
records  pertaining  thereto,  Lender and Lender's  Inspector shall have no
liability or obligation to Borrower or any third person arising out of such
inspection;  and neither Borrower nor any third person shall be entitled to
rely upon any such inspection or review.  Inspection not followed by notice
of default shall not  constitute (a) a waiver of any default then existing;
(b) an acknowledgment  or  representation  by Lender or Lender's  Inspector
that there has been or will be compliance with the Plans,  the Construction
Contract(s),  the Budget, the Loan Documents,  applicable laws, regulations
and private restrictions, sound construction,  engineering or architectural
principles or commonly accepted safety standards,  or that the construction
is free  from  defective  materials  or  workmanship;  or (c) a  waiver  of
Lender's  right to insist that  Completion  of the Work occur in accordance
with the Plans,  Construction  Contract(s),  the  Budget,  Loan  Documents,
applicable   laws,   regulations   and   restrictions   of  record,   sound
construction,  engineering or  architectural  principles or commonly safety
standards and free from  defective  materials and  workmanship.  Lender and
Lender's  Inspector  owe no duty of care to Borrower or any third person to
protect  against,  or inform Borrower or any third person of, the existence
of negligence,  faulty,  inadequate or defective  design or construction of
the Work.

(3) To the extent  that any  construction  within the  Project is funded by
sources  other  than the Loan  contemplated  herein  (including  Borrower's
equity), Borrower shall allow Lender's Inspector (at Borrower's expense) to
review and inspect such  construction  work and such construction work must
meet Lender's standards and specifications.

D.  Borrower  shall  strictly  enforce  all  material   provisions  of  the
Construction   Contract,   the   Architect/Engineer   Agreement  and  all  other
contract(s) for the  construction  of the Time-Share  Project to ensure that the
other parties thereto are required to promptly and diligently perform all of its
or their  obligations  thereunder  and in such a manner as to preserve  Lender's
security interest in the Collateral and the Time-Share  Project.  Borrower shall
timely  perform all its  obligations  under the  aforementioned  agreements  and
contracts.  No material change,  amendment or modification shall be made to such
contract(s) without the prior written consent of Lender.

E. No materials,  equipment,  fixtures or any other part of the  Time-Share
Project,  or articles of personal  property  placed in the  Time-Share  Project,
shall  be  purchased  or  installed  under  any  security   agreement  or  other
arrangements  wherein  the seller  reserves  or purports to reserve the right to
remove or to  repossess  any such items or to consider  them  personal  property
after their incorporation into the Time-Share Project.

F. Borrower shall commence  construction  of the  Improvements on or before
the date hereof,  shall  continue the Work without  material  interruption,  and
shall cause Completion on or before the Required  Completion Date subject to the
occurrence  of Force  Majeure  Events  not to  exceed  ninety  (90)  days in the
aggregate.  Borrower  shall (a) permit no  material  deviations  to occur in the
progress,  timing or completion of construction of the Time-Share  Project;  (b)
cause the Time-Share Project to be constructed  substantially in accordance with
the Budget;  (c) otherwise abide by the Work Progress Schedule and Budget in all
material  respects;  and (d)  cause  the  Completion  of the  Work in a good and
workmanlike  manner  substantially  according to the Plans,  free from all legal
charges,  encumbrances  and rights of third  parties  (other than the  Permitted
Encumbrances and the Mortgage), and in accordance with all applicable ordinances
and statutes, including zoning laws, all covenants,  conditions and restrictions
running  with  the  land,  and  all   regulations  and  building  codes  of  any
governmental  or  municipal  agency  having  jurisdiction  over  the  Time-Share
Project.

G. Borrower shall pay when due all costs, expenses and claims pertaining to
the Work and deliver to Lender during the course of the Work in order to monitor
and/or  provide  assurance  that the Work is proceeding  lien free in accordance
with the  requirements  of this Agreement:  bills of sale,  conveyances and paid
invoices  pertaining to the Work;  all waivers and releases of lien or claims on
the Real Property and/or the Improvements on account of the Work Lender may

Lender, additional engineering or architectural studies and reports as Lender or
Lender's Inspector may require.

restrictions,   the  Loan  Documents,   sound   construction,   engineering  and
architectural  principles and commonly  accepted safety  standards and free from
defective  materials  and  workmanship.  No  material  changes,  alterations  or
modifications  shall  be  made in the  Plans  or in any of the  other  Principal
Work-Related  Items  without  Lender's  prior  written  approval.  The foregoing
notwithstanding, Borrower shall be permitted to make changes in the Plans to the
extent that such change order (a) does not  increase the cost of the  Time-Share
Project by more than Twenty-Five  Thousand Dollars  ($25,000) or, with all other
changes,  does not increase the cost of the Time-Share  Project by more than One
Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000),  and (b) does not materially  affect the
design,  structural  integrity or quality of the  Improvements.  Borrower  shall
deliver to Lender,  immediately upon execution  thereof,  all change orders with
respect to the Work,  including  those  within the scope of clauses  (a) and (b)
above.

I.  Borrower  shall  not enter  into any  Architect/Engineer  Agreement  or
Construction  Contract (other than those  contracts and agreements  which Lender

and with such parties as Lender may approve in writing.

J.  Borrower  shall  record,  or  cause  to be  recorded,  all  notices  of
commencement/completion  and similar  notices  permitted by applicable  laws and

M. Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,  to Lender prior to or
concurrently with each Work-Related  Advance,  a date down endorsement in a form
acceptable to Lender  issued by the Title Company  insuring that the Mortgage at
the time of each Work-Related  Advance,  constitutes a valid first priority lien
upon the Real  Property or title,  subject only to the  Permitted  Encumbrances;
upon  construction  of the  foundation for any building  comprising  part of the
Improvements  deliver,  or cause  to be  delivered,  to  Lender  an  endorsement
("foundation  endorsement") insuring that the foundations,  as constructed,  are
located  within all set-back and boundary  lines of the Real Property and do not
encroach upon any easements, rights of way (public or private) or upon any other
adjoining  landowner's  property;  and upon the final advance of the  retainage,
Borrower shall deliver,  or cause Title Agent to deliver,  to Lender a date down
endorsement or a re-issued title policy  ("Re-Issued  Title Policy") meeting the
substantive requirements set forth above.

N. Borrower  shall notify Lender in writing if and when the unpaid costs of
Completion of the Work exceed or appear likely to exceed the undisbursed portion
of the Loan and any undisbursed Required Completion Assurance Deposit(s) held by
Lender.

O. Borrower  shall deliver to Lender  promptly  after the completion of the
foundation and, if required by Lender, after the pouring of a street,  curbstone
or concrete slab on the Real Property,  a survey prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Loan Agreement,  showing such  Improvements,  their location
within  the  boundary  and set back  lines of the  Real  Property  and a lack of

satisfying the requirements of Loan Agreement;

P. Borrower shall,  after obtaining  knowledge or receiving notice thereof,

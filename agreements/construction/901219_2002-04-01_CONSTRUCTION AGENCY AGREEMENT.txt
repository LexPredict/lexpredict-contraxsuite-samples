Following the execution and delivery of the Manufacturing Facility Supplement as
provided above and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth
in Section 4.3 of the Participation Agreement, such Manufacturing Facility
Supplement, and Exhibit A to the Manufacturing Facility Supplement attached
thereto, shall constitute a part of this Agreement.

2.4     Construction Materials; Construction Documents.

(a)     Traville Facility

(i)     Construction Agent shall develop, define, refine
and detail proposed budgets, construction schedules and Traville
Plans and Specifications for the Traville Facility. Construction
Agent shall cause each such proposal to provide for compliance
and conformance with generally accepted construction practices,
Applicable Law, Insurance Requirements, Environmental
Requirements and Section 2.6(a) and shall cause each such
proposal to have a reasonable likelihood that it can be
completed as intended on time and within budget. In addition,
the budget for the Traville Facility shall not exceed Two
Hundred and Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($225,000,000), except
as otherwise provided in clause (ii) below. Construction Agent
shall cause such proposal to be provided to the Construction
Consultant for review and approval. Upon the approval of any
such proposal by the Construction Consultant of such proposed
construction budget, construction schedule or plans and
specifications for the Traville Facility, such proposed
construction budget, construction schedule or plans and
specifications shall become, as applicable, the approved
construction budget (as amended or modified from time to time in
accordance with the Terms of this Agreement, the "Approved
Traville Construction Budget"), the approved construction
schedule (as amended or modified from time to time in accordance
with the Terms of this Agreement, the "Approved Traville
Construction Schedule") and the approved plans and
specifications (as amended or modified from time to time in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Approved
Traville Plans and Specifications") for the Traville Facility.
Failure of the Construction Consultant to respond within sixty
(60) days of receipt in writing of any such proposal will be
deemed rejection thereof, however, if the Construction
Consultant requests additional information or clarifications,
such sixty (60) day period will commence from the date when all
such requests have been satisfied. If the Construction
Consultant shall reject or not expressly approve any such
proposal, then Construction Agent shall consult with the
Construction Consultant, revise such proposal and resubmit it,
repeating such process until all Traville Construction Materials
are approved or deemed to be approved.

(ii)    During the Construction Period, Construction
Agent may enter into any changes, supplements, amendments or
revisions ("change orders") to the Traville Construction
Materials so long as the change order could not reasonably have
any adverse effect on the as-built value, utility, residual
value at the end of the Lease Term or useful life of the
Traville Facility or extend Substantial Completion of the
Property beyond the Outside Completion Date (such a change order
that results in an adverse affect described above with respect
to either

CONSTRUCTION AGENCY AGREEMENT (HGSI)


Property, a "Material Change Order"), and the costs attributable
to such change order, together with the costs of all other
change orders in respect of the Traville Facility, do not result
in a net increase in the Approved Traville Construction Budget
unless and only to the extent that the Approved Manufacturing
Construction Budget has been decreased by a like amount.

(b)     Manufacturing Facility

(i)     Construction Agent shall develop, define, refine
and detail proposed budgets, construction schedules and
Manufacturing Plans and Specifications for the Manufacturing
Facility. Construction Agent shall cause each such proposal to
provide for compliance and conformance with generally accepted
construction practices, Applicable Law, Insurance Requirements,
Environmental Requirements and Section 2.6(a) and shall cause
each such proposal to have a reasonable likelihood that it can
be completed as intended on time and within budget. In addition,
the budget for the Manufacturing Facility shall not exceed Two
Hundred and Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($225,000,000), except
as otherwise provided in clause (ii) below. Construction Agent
shall cause such proposal to be provided to the Construction
Consultant for review and approval. Upon the approval of any
such proposal by the Construction Consultant of such proposed
construction budget, construction schedule or plans and
specifications for the Manufacturing Facility, such proposed
construction budget, (as amended or modified from time to time
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Approved
Manufacturing Construction Budget"), the approved construction
schedule (as amended or modified from time to time in accordance
with the Terms of this Agreement, the "Approved Manufacturing
Construction Schedule") and the approved plans and
specifications (as amended or modified from time to time in
accordance with the Terms of this Agreement, the "Approved
Manufacturing Plans and Specifications") for the Manufacturing
Facility. Failure of the Construction Consultant to respond
within sixty (60) days of receipt in writing of any such
proposal will be deemed rejection thereof, however, if the
Construction Consultant requests additional information or
clarifications, such sixty (60) day period will commence from
the date when all such requests have been satisfied. If the
Construction Consultant shall reject or not expressly approve
any such proposal, then Construction Agent shall consult with
the Construction Consultant, revise such proposal and resubmit
it, repeating such process until all Manufacturing Construction
Materials are approved or deemed to be approved.

(ii)    During the Construction Period, Construction
Agent may enter into change orders to the Manufacturing
Construction Materials so long as the costs attributable to such
change order, together with the costs of all other change orders
in respect of the Manufacturing Facility, do not result in a net
increase in the Approved Manufacturing Budget unless and only to
the extent that the Approved Traville Construction Budget has
been decreased by a like amount; provided that Material Change
Orders must comply with clause (iii) below.

respect to either Property, Construction Agent shall submit a
proposal outlining any such proposed change order to the
Construction Consultant for approval. The approval process for
Material Change Orders shall allow the Construction Consultant
twenty (20) days to review any submission and to accept or
reject such submission (or request additional information in
respect thereof) with a failure to respond after twenty (20)
days being deemed acceptance thereof.

(c)     Subject to each of the terms and conditions in this
Agreement, Construction Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement by or through agents, developers, consultants, advisors,
contractors, employees or attorneys-in-fact (other than the Construction

enter into such agreements with architects and contractors as
Construction Agent deems necessary or desirable for the completion of
the Construction pursuant hereto (as such documents may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified except as prohibited hereby, the
"Construction Documents").

(d)     Certifications. Any amendment to either the Traville
Construction Materials or the Manufacturing Construction Materials for
which Construction Agent does not seek the approval of Lessor shall be
deemed a certification by Construction Agent that such amendment
complies with the foregoing requirement.

2.5     Assignment Under Construction. Construction Agent hereby
collaterally assigns all Material Construction Documents and all the proceeds
(including liquidated damages, insurance proceeds and warranty payments), if
any, payable to Construction Agent or its affiliates under the Construction

Majeure Event. Any such request shall be in writing delivered to Lessor
and Administrative Agent and shall contain a certification by
Construction Agent (1) describing the facts and circumstances giving
rise to such Force Majeure Event, the expected duration of such Force
Majeure Event and the date Construction Agent reasonably believes

Property within such extension period in accordance with the Traville
Construction Materials or the Manufacturing Construction Materials, as
applicable (excluding all Construction Period Accrued Interest,
Construction Period Accrued Yield and Construction Period Fees
applicable to such Property accruing during such extension period) and
(3) that the occurrence of such Force Majeure Event and the Construction
to occur following such date will not materially affect the appraised
value set forth in the applicable As-Built Appraisal delivered with
respect to such Site pursuant to Section 4.1(s) or 4.3(q), as
applicable, of the Participation Agreement. Construction Agent shall
also supply to Lessor and Administrative Agent such other information as
each such Person may reasonably request. The consent of Lessor under

made that the request meets the requirements set forth herein in all
material respects.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the applicable Outside
Completion Date for such Property shall be automatically extended for the period
(not to exceed a total of sixty (60) days following the original Outside
Completion Date for such Property) necessary to achieve Substantial Completion
for such Property in light of such Force Majeure Event, provided, that (A) the
length of the extension required in light of such Force Majeure Event is certain
(either because the Force Majeure Event has ended or because Construction Agent
has entered into a replacement contract with a definite term (unimpeded by such
Force Majeure Event) to complete the work originally interrupted by the Force
Majeure Event), and (B) Construction Agent delivers to the Administrative Agent
certification (without assumptions or, except as set forth therein,
qualifications) as to and describing the items supporting each of the matters

Participation Agreement) from Lessor (a) both Properties in the event
that, as of the date of the termination of this Agreement, the Lease
Commencement Date shall have not yet occurred with respect to either
Property, (b) only the Traville Facility in the event that, as of the
date of the termination of this Agreement, the Lease Commencement Date
shall have already occurred with respect to the Manufacturing Facility
but shall have not yet occurred with respect to the Traville Facility,
or (c) only the Manufacturing Facility in the event that, as of the date
of the termination of this Agreement, the Lease Commencement Date shall
have already occurred with respect to the Traville Facility but shall
have not yet occurred with respect to the Manufacturing Facility, by
paying immediately upon such exercise an amount equal to the excess of
(x) (1) in the event that Construction Agent exercises its option to
purchase both Properties pursuant to clause (ii)(a) above, the aggregate
Lease Balance, plus, without duplication, any other amounts then due and
owing under the Operative Documents, as of the date of such payment, (2)
in the event that Construction Agent exercises its option to purchase
only the Traville Facility pursuant to clause (ii)(b) above, the
Traville Lease Balance, plus, without duplication, any other amounts

Operative Documents, as of the date of such payment, or (3) in the event

Manufacturing Lease Balance, plus, without duplication, any other
amounts then due and owing with respect to the Manufacturing Facility

amounts paid by Construction Agent under clause (i) above. Unless
Construction Agent shall have so exercised the purchase option, Lessor
shall cause each Property to be sold in accordance with Section 5.3(a).
If Construction Agent shall have so exercised the purchase option (and
made all applicable payments in respect thereof), Lessor shall promptly
convey title to the Improvements applicable to the Property or
Properties so purchased to Lessee or their designee in accordance with
Article XV of the Lease assuming for these purposes that said Article of
the Lease were then applicable.

5.2     Survival.

(a)     The termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part,
pursuant to Section 5.1 shall in no event relieve Construction Agent of
their liability hereunder which accrued prior to such termination, all
of which shall survive any such termination.

<PAGE>

CONSTRUCTION AGENCY AGREEMENT (HGSI)


(b)     Construction Agent's right to purchase one or both of
the Properties within five (5) Business Days following the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1.2 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement until the termination of such five (5)
Business Day period.

5.3     Remedies Cumulative; Waivers. Upon the occurrence and
continuance of a Construction Agency Event of Default, at Lessor's option and
without limiting Lessor in the exercise of any other right or remedy Lessor may
have on account (including, without limitation, any remedies under any other
Operative Document or as set forth in Section 5.1.2), and without any further
demand or notice, but subject to Section 5.4 below and the proviso of the first
sentence of Section 5.1.2 and the second sentence of Section 5.1.2 above, Lessor
may cause the following to occur:

(a)     Lessor shall have all the rights and may pursue any of
the remedies hereunder with respect to Construction Period Maximum
Guaranty Amount as are provided to it in the Lease with respect to the
payment of Residual Value Guaranty Amount as if those provisions were
incorporated herein including, Lessor acting as exclusive sales agent
for the Properties. Lessor and Administrative Agent may foreclose the
lien of the Lessee Deed of Trust on all or any portion of the Properties
and other Collateral, including all or any of such Sites and the related
Deed of Trust. In addition, Lessor may exercise its remedies under the
Security Agreement.

(b)     Lessor may continue this Agreement in effect for so long
as Lessor shall determine, and Lessor may enforce all of Lessor's rights
and remedies under this Agreement, and require the completion of the
Improvements by Construction Agent as herein described, so long as
Lessor satisfies its obligations under Section 4.1 and provides or
otherwise obtains the funds therefor and advances such funds to
Construction Agent.

(c)     Lessor may terminate this Agreement at any time,
notwithstanding a prior election under Section 5.3(b) to cause the
completion of the Improvements with respect thereto directly through
Lessor or one or more successor construction agents.

(d)     Lessor may exercise any other right or remedy that may
be available to it under Applicable Laws or in equity, or proceed by
appropriate court action (legal or equitable) to enforce the terms or to
recover damages for the breach hereof.

(e)     Subject to the provisions hereof, as a matter of right
and with notice to Construction Agent or anyone claiming under
Construction Agent, and without regard to the then value of the
Collateral or the interest of any Lessee therein, Lessor shall have the
right to apply to any court having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or
receivers of the Collateral or any portion thereof at Lessee and
Construction Agent's sole cost and expense (subject to Section 5.4
hereof), and Construction Agent hereby irrevocably consents to such
appointment and waive notice of any application therefor. Any such
receiver or receivers shall have all the usual powers and duties of
receivers in like or similar cases and all the powers and duties of
Lessor in case of entry as provided in this Agreement and shall continue
as such and exercise all such powers until the latest to



15
<PAGE>

CONSTRUCTION AGENCY AGREEMENT (HGSI)


occur of (i) the date of confirmation of sale of the applicable
Collateral; (ii) the disbursement of all proceeds of such Collateral
collected by such receiver and the payment of all expenses incurred in
connection therewith; or (iii) the termination of such receivership with
the consent of Lessor or pursuant to an order by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

(f)     To the extent permitted by, and subject to the mandatory
requirements of, any Applicable Law, each and every right, power and
remedy herein specifically given to Lessor or otherwise in this
Agreement shall be cumulative and, subject to Section 5.4, shall be in
addition to every other right, power and remedy herein specifically
given or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute, and
each and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein given
or otherwise existing may be exercised from time to time and as often
and in such order as may be deemed expedient by Lessor, and the exercise
or the beginning of the exercise of any power or remedy shall not be
construed to be a waiver of the right to exercise at the same time or
thereafter any other right, power or remedy. Lessor's consent to any
request made by Construction Agent shall not be deemed to constitute or
preclude the necessity for obtaining Lessor's consent, in the future, to
all similar requests. No express or implied waiver by Lessor of any
Construction Agency Event of Default shall in any way be, or be
construed to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Construction
Agency Event of Default. To the extent permitted by any Applicable Law,
Construction Agent hereby waives any rights now or hereafter conferred
by statute or otherwise that may require Lessor to sell, lease or
otherwise use the Properties, any Site, the other collateral or any part
thereof in mitigation of Lessor's damages upon the occurrence of a
Construction Agency Event of Default or that may otherwise limit or
modify any of Lessor's rights or remedies under this Article V.

(g)     No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on
the part of Lessor, any right, remedy, power or privilege under this
Agreement or under the other Operative Documents shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided
in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

(h)     Upon termination of this Agreement as a result of a
Construction Agency Event of Default, Construction Agent shall pay on
behalf of Lessor to the Administrative Agent, for application in
accordance with Article X of the Participation Agreement, in immediately
available funds, the Construction Period Maximum Guaranty Amount.

5.4     Limitation on Recourse Liability of Construction Agent.

(a)     Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the
contrary, the aggregate amount payable by Construction Agent on a
recourse basis under this Article V as the result of the occurrence of a
Construction Agency Event of Default shall be subject to the limitations
on the recourse liability of Construction Agent set forth in Section
11.2 of the Participation Agreement.

CONSTRUCTION AGENCY AGREEMENT (HGSI)


(b)     Lessor's exercise of any remedy provided hereunder or
otherwise available at law or equity, including any demand for
reimbursements of amounts expended by or on behalf of Lessor to cure any
Construction Agency Event of Default shall not impair or otherwise
reduce Construction Agent's obligation to pay the Construction Period
Maximum Guaranty Amount and the timely application of such amount to the
outstanding principal amount and accrued interest thereon under the Loan
Agreement in accordance with the Participation Agreement.

5.5     Lessor's Right to Cure Construction Agent's Defaults. Lessor,
without waiving or releasing any obligation or Construction Agency Event of
Default, may (but shall be under no obligation to) remedy any Construction
Agency Event of Default, and in furtherance of such right, Lessor may make
Advance Requests, execute Construction Documents and otherwise exercise all
rights and perform all duties of Construction Agent hereunder and Lessee under
the Participation Agreement with respect to the Construction. All reasonable out
of pocket costs and expenses so incurred (including reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel), together with interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date on
which such sums or expenses are paid by Lessor, shall (subject to Section 5.4
above) be funded and paid by Lessor through Advances.

5.6     Determination of Whether Budget is "In Balance".

(a)     If Administrative Agent determines that either the
Approved Traville Construction Budget or the Approved Manufacturing
Construction Budget may not be In Balance, Administrative Agent shall
give notice to such effect to Construction Agent, together with a
reasonably detailed explanation of the basis for Administrative Agent's
determination and to the extent available calculations upon which
Administrative Agent or the Construction Consultant has based its
determination. Within ten (10) days following Construction Agent's
receipt of such notice, Construction Agent shall deliver a certification
to Administrative Agent that either (i) the Approved Traville
Construction Budget or the Approved Manufacturing Construction Budget,
as applicable, is not In Balance and describing the steps Construction
Agent is taking to remedy such condition, if any, or (ii) the Approved
Traville Construction Budget or the Approved Manufacturing Construction
Budget, as applicable, is In Balance and stating sufficient detail to
describe why Construction Agent believes the Approved Traville
Construction Budget or the Approved Manufacturing Construction Budget,
as applicable, is In Balance.

(b)     If after receipt by Administrative Agent of a
certification from Construction Agent pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(ii)
above that the Approved Traville Construction Budget or the Approved
Manufacturing Construction Budget, as applicable, is In Balance,
Administrative Agent still disagrees with such certification,
Construction Agent and Administrative Agent shall, for a period of
thirty (30) days following Administrative Agent's receipt of such
certification, consult with each other and use their reasonable efforts
to resolve such dispute as to whether the applicable Construction Budget
is In Balance.

(c)     Upon the occurrence of either (i) Construction Agent's
delivery of certification pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(i) above that the
Approved Traville Construction Budget or the Approved Manufacturing
Construction Budget, as applicable, is not In



17
<PAGE>

CONSTRUCTION AGENCY AGREEMENT (HGSI)


Balance, or (ii) the thirty (30) day consultation period referred to in
Section 5.6(b) above shall expire and any Agent shall continue to
disagree with Construction Agent's assertion that the Approved Traville
Construction Budget or the Approved Manufacturing Construction Budget,
as applicable, is In Balance, Lessor shall have the option, exercisable
in its sole discretion upon notice to Construction Agent, to require
Construction Agent to deposit (a "Balancing Deposit) with Lessor within
five (5) Business Days an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount
which if paid to Construction Agent would, together with any Available
Commitments and Other Available Proceeds, be sufficient to make the
Approved Traville Construction Budget or the Approved Manufacturing
Construction Budget, as applicable, In Balance and (y) the Construction
Period Maximum Guaranty Amount.

(d)     In the event that Construction Agent is required to make
a Balancing Deposit pursuant to Section 5.6(c) above, such Balancing
Deposit shall evidence a portion of the Construction Period Maximum
Guaranty Amount and any amounts withdrawn from the Balancing Deposit to
fund Property Costs shall reduce dollar for dollar the Construction
Period Maximum Guaranty Amount.

5.7     Limitations on Construction Agent's Liability. In any action or
proceeding involving any state law, any federal bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization law, or any other law affecting the rights of creditors
generally, if the obligations of Construction Agent under the Operative
Documents would otherwise be held or determined to be voidable, invalid or
unenforceable as a fraudulent transfer or otherwise as a result or on account of
the amount of its liability under the Operative Documents, then, notwithstanding
any other provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall,
without any further action by Construction Agent or any other Person, be
automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount which is valid and
enforceable.

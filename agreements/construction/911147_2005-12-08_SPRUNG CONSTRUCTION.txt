methods listed in Section 7.3.3 of AIA Document A201-1997.




§
6.2 In
calculating adjustments to subcontracts (except those awarded with the Owner's
prior consent on the basis of cost
plus
a fee), the terms "cost" and "fee" as used in Section 7.3.3.3 of AIA Document
A201-1997 and the terms "costs"
and "a reasonable allowance for overhead and profit" as used in Section 7.3.6
of
AIA Document A201-1997 shall have the meanings assigned to them in AIA Document
A201-1997 and shall not be modified by Articles 5, 7 and
8 of
this Agreement. Adjustments to subcontracts awarded with the Owner's prior
consent on the basis of cost plus a fee shall be calculated in accordance with

"costs" as used in the above-referenced provisions of AIA Document A201-1997
shall mean the Cost of the Work as defined in Article 7 of
this
Agreement and the terms "fee" and "a reasonable allowance for overhead and
profit" shall mean the Contractor's Fee as defined in Section 5.1.2 of this
Agreement.

specific provision is made in Section 5.1 for adjustment of the Contractor's
Fee
in the case of changes in the Work, or if the extent of such changes is such,

5.1 will cause substantial inequity to the Owner or Contractor, the Contractor's
Fee shall be equitably adjusted on the basis of the Fee established for the
original Work, and the Guaranteed Maximum Price shall be adjusted
accordingly.

appropriate agreements with the Contractor. The Owner may
designate specific persons or entities from whom the Contractor shall obtain

the
Work; and (3) has submitted
a bid that conforms to the requirements of the Contract Documents without
reservations or exceptions, but the
Owner
requires that another bid be accepted, then the Contractor may require that
a
Change Order be issued to adjust

the Contractor and the amount of the subcontract or other agreement actually
signed with the person or entity
designated by the Owner.

§
12.1 PROGRESS PAYMENTS

§

upon Applications for Payment submitted to the Architect by the Contractor
and
Certificates for

Payment
issued by the Architect, the Owner shall make progress payments on account
of
the Contract Sum to the

Contractor
as provided below and elsewhere in the Contract Documents.




§
12.1.2
The
period covered by each Application for Payment shall be one calendar month
ending on the last day of the
month, or as follows:







§
12.1.3
Provided
that an Application for Payment is received by the Architect not later than
the
First day of a month, the Owner shall make payment to the Contractor not later
than the Fifteenth day of the same month. If an Application
for Payment is received by the Architect after the application date fixed above,
payment shall be made by
the
Owner not later than Fifteen ( 15 ) days after the Architect receives the
Application for Payment.



































§
12.1.4 With
each
Application for Payment, the Contractor shall submit payrolls, petty cash
accounts, receipted invoices
or invoices with check vouchers attached, and any other evidence required by
the
Owner or Architect to demonstrate that cash disbursements already made by the
Contractor on account of the Cost of the Work equal or exceed
(1) progress payments already received by the Contractor; less (2) that portion
of those payments attributable to
the
Contractor's Fee; plus (***WEEKLY*** payrolls for the period covered by the
present Application for Payment.




§
12.1.5
Each
Application for Payment shall be based on the most recent schedule of values
submitted by the Contractor
in accordance with the Contract Documents. The schedule of values shall allocate
the entire Guaranteed Maximum
Price among the various portions of the Work, except that the Contractor's
Fee
shall be shown as a single separate
item. The schedule of values shall be prepared in such form and supported by
such data to substantiate its accuracy
as the Architect may require. This schedule, unless objected to by the
Architect, shall be used as a basis for reviewing
the Contractor's Applications for Payment.




§
12.1.6 Applications
for Payment shall show the percentage of completion of each portion of the
Work
as of the end of
the
period covered by the Application for Payment. The percentage of completion
shall be the lesser of (1) the percentage of that portion of the Work which
has
actually been completed; or (2) the percentage obtained by dividing
(a) the expense that has actually been incurred by the Contractor on account
of
that portion of the Work for which the Contractor has made or intends to make
actual payment prior to the next Application for Payment by (b) the
share
of the Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion of the Work in the
schedule of values.




§
12.1.7 Subject
to other provisions of the Contract Documents, the amount of each progress
payment shall be computed as follows:






.1


take
that portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable to
completed Work as determined by multiplying the percentage of completion
of each portion of the Work by the share of the
Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion of the Work in
the
schedule of values. Pending final determination of cost to the Owner
of
changes in the Work, amounts not in dispute shall be included as
provided
in Section 7.3.8 of AIA Document
A201-1997;











.2


add
that portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable to
materials and equipment delivered
and suitably stored at the site for subsequent incorporation in the
Work,
or if approved in advance by the Owner, suitably stored off the site
at a
location agreed upon in writing;









.3 add
the
Contractor's Fee, less retainage of ***TEN PERCENT (10%) OF PRIMARY SUBCONTRACTORS,
UP TO 50% COMPLETION ONLY*** ).The Contractor's Fee    shall be
computed upon the
Cost
of the Work described in the two preceding Clauses at the rate stated in Section
5.1.2 or, if the Contractor's Fee
is
stated as a fixed sum in that Subparagraph, shall be an amount that bears the
same ratio to that fixed-sum fee as the Cost of the Work in the two preceding
Clauses bears to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of the Work
upon
its completion;





.4


subtract
the aggregate of previous payments made by the
Owner;











.5


subtract
the shortfall, if any, indicated by the Contractor in the documentation
required by Section 12.1.4 to substantiate prior Applications for
Payment,
or resulting from errors subsequently discovered
by the Owner's accountants in such documentation;
and











.6


subtract
amounts, if any, for which the Architect has withheld or nullified
a
Certificate for Payment as provided in Section 9.5 of AIA Document
A201-1997.









§
12.1.8 Except
with the Owner's prior approval, payments to Subcontractors shall be subject
to
retainage of not less than
Ten
percent ( 10.00% ). The Owner and the Contractor shall agree upon a mutually
acceptable procedure for review
and approval of payments and retention for Subcontractors.




§
12.1.9 In
taking
action on the Contractor's Applications for Payment, the Architect shall be
entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of the information furnished
by the Contractor and shall not be deemed to represent that the
Architect has made a detailed examination, audit or arithmetic verification
of
the documentation submitted in accordance with Section 12.1.4 or other
supporting data; that the Architect has made exhaustive or continuous
on-site
inspections or that the Architect has made examinations to ascertain how or
for
what purposes the Contractor has
used
amounts previously paid on account of the Contract. Such examinations, audits
and verifications, if required by the Owner, will be performed by the Owner's
accountants acting in the sole interest of the Owner.









































§12.2
FINAL PAYMENT

§
12.2.1 Final
payment, constituting the entire unpaid balance of the Contract Sum, shall
be
made by the Owner to

the
Contractor when:






.1


the
Contractor has fully performed the Contract except for the Contractor's
responsibility to correct Work
as provided in Section 12.2.2 of AIA Document A201-1997, and to satisfy
other requirements, if any, which extend beyond final payment;
and











.2


a
final Certificate for Payment has been issued by the
Architect.









§
12.2.2 The
Owner's final payment to the Contractor shall be made no later than 30 days
after the issuance of the Architect's
final Certificate for Payment, or as follows:







§
12.2.3 The
Owner's accountants will review and report in writing on the Contractor's final
accounting within 30 days
after delivery of the final accounting to the Architect by the Contractor.
Based
upon such Cost of the Work as the Owner's accountants report to be substantiated
by the Contractor's final accounting, and provided the other conditions of
Section 12.2.1 have been met, the Architect will, within seven days after
receipt of the written report of the Owner's accountants, either issue to the
Owner a final Certificate for Payment with a copy to the Contractor, or notify
the Contractor and Owner in writing of the Architect's reasons for withholding
a
certificate as provided in Section
9.5.1 of the AIA Document A201-1997. The time periods stated in this Section
12.2.3 supersede those stated in Section 9.4.1 of the AIA Document
A201-1997.




§
12.2.4 If
the
Owner's accountants report the Cost of the Work as substantiated by the
Contractor's final accounting to
be
less than claimed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall be entitled to demand
arbitration of the disputed amount without a further decision of the Architect.
Such demand for arbitration shall be made by the Contractor within 30 days
after
the Contractor's receipt of a copy of the Architect's final Certificate for
Payment; failure to demand arbitration within this 30-day period shall result
in
the substantiated amount reported by the Owner's accountants becoming binding
on
the Contractor. Pending a final resolution by arbitration, the Owner shall
pay
the Contractor the amount certified in the Architect's final Certificate for
Payment.




§
12.2.5 If,
subsequent to final payment and at the Owner's request, the Contractor incurs
costs described in Article 7 and
not
excluded by Article 8 to correct defective or nonconforming Work, the Owner
shall reimburse the Contractor such costs and the Contractor's Fee applicable
thereto on the same basis as if such costs had been incurred prior to final
payment, but not in excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price. If the Contractor
has participated in savings as provided in Section 5.2, the amount of such
savings shall be recalculated and appropriate credit
given to the Owner in determining the net amount to be paid by the Owner to
the
Contractor.




ARTICLE
13 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION

§
13.1
The
Contract may be terminated by the Contractor, or by the Owner for convenience,
as provided in Article 14
of AIA
Document A201-1997. However, the amount to be paid to the Contractor under
Section 14.1.3 of AIA Document A201-1997 shall not exceed the amount the
Contractor would be entitled to receive under Section 13.2 below,
except that the Contractor's Fee shall be calculated as if the Work had been
fully completed by the Contractor, including a reasonable estimate of the Cost
of the Work for Work not actually completed.




§
13.2 The
Contract may be terminated by the Owner for cause as provided in Article 14
of
AIA Document A201-1997. The amount, if any, to be paid to the Contractor under
Section 14.2.4 of AIA Document A201-1997 shall not cause the Guaranteed Maximum
Price to be exceeded, nor shall it exceed an amount calculated as
follows:




§
13.2.1 Take
the
Cost of the Work incurred by the Contractor to the date of
termination;






































§
13.2.2 Add
the
Contractor's Fee computed upon the Cost of the Work to the date of termination
at the rate stated in Section
5.1.2 or, if the Contractor's Fee is stated as a fixed sum in that Section,
an
amount that bears the same ratio to that fixed-sum Fee as the Cost of the Work
at the time of termination bears to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost
of the Work upon its completion; and




§
13.2.3 Subtract
the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.




§
13.3 The
Owner
shall also pay the Contractor fair compensation, either by purchase or rental
at
the election of the Owner, for any equipment owned by the Contractor that the
Owner elects to retain and that is not otherwise included in
the
Cost of the Work under Section 13.2.1. To the extent that the Owner elects
to
take legal assignment of subcontracts
and purchase orders (including rental agreements), the Contractor shall, as
a
condition of receiving the payments
referred to in this Article 13, execute and deliver all such papers and take
all
such steps, including the legal assignment of such subcontracts and other
contractual rights of the Contractor, as the Owner may require for the purpose
of fully vesting in the Owner the rights and benefits of the Contractor under
such subcontracts or purchase
orders.




§
13.4 The
Work
may be suspended by the Owner as provided in Article 14 of AIA Document
A201-1997; in such case,
the
Guaranteed Maximum Price and Contract Time shall be increased as provided in
Section 14.3.2 of AIA Document
A201-1997 except that the term "profit" shall be understood to mean the
Contractor's Fee as described in Sections 5.1.2 and Section 6.4 of this
Agreement.

ADDITIONAL
PROVISIONS

GENERAL
CONTRACT COST PLUS A FEE WITH A GMP, A111 - 1997






1.
Effect
of Additional Provisions.
These
Additional Provisions control over conflicting portions of the attached
A111
(the Contract Form), the A201 General Conditions (the General Conditions),
and
other Contract Documents.




2.
Additional
General Conditions.
The
General Conditions for this project shall be AIA A201, 1997, subject


to
modification as set forth herein.




3.
Architect
Role. INTENTIONALLY
DELETED




4.
Building
Permit.
The
Owner shall secure and pay for all building permits, land use approvals,
approvals from any government agency, ALL UTILITY FEES, and other permits
and
approvals necessary to perform the Work. If the Owner does not secure such
permits and approvals within the time periods required in order to perform
the
work on a timely basis, the Contractor shall be entitled to an appropriate
adjustment to the Contract Sum or Contract Time.




5.
Changes.
Unless
otherwise agreed, additive change orders shall increase the Contract Sum
by the
cost of the work, including the cost of any associated design work plus
a
contractor’s fee of FIVE PERCENT (5%) (or such other change order fee as may be
stated in the Contract documents) and deductive change orders shall reduce
the
Contract Sum only by the cost of the work associated with the deduction.
For
deductive changes, the profit, overhead or fee associated with the subject
work
shall not be utilized in calculating the reduction to the Contract Sum.
The
Contract Time shall be extended to reflect the impacts of any changes.
Change
Orders signed by the parties shall not be deemed to address the cumulative
impacts on the Contract Sum or Contract Time of numerous change orders,
and such
cumulative impacts may be the subject of appropriate claim proceedings
by
Contractor. If, in connection with any change, the parties have not agreed
on
the amount properly due in connection with the change or the adjustment,
if any,
to the Contract Time resulting from such change, or otherwise have not
finalized
a change order, the Contractor may nonetheless submit payment requests
for
change order work performed and materials delivered as part of the normal
payment process, and the Owner shall in good faith pay the undisputed portion
of
the change order work and materials in accordance with the provisions hereof
for
progress and final payments. If Owner requests a proposal for a change
in the
Work and subsequently elects not to proceed with the change, a Change Order
shall be issued to reimburse Contractor for reasonable costs incurred for
estimating services involved in the preparation of proposed revisions to
the
Contract.




6
Change
Directives.
The
Owner may utilize Construction Change Directives to direct changes in the
work
without Contractor’s written agreement only to the extent that the aggregate
costs for all pending Construction Change Directive work does not exceed
$5,000.
Contractor may refuse to perform any Construction Change Directive where
the
anticipated costs associated with such Construction Change Directive, together
with incurred or projected costs on other Construction Change Directives
will
exceed $
5,000.00. Work initiated by Construction Change Directive but subsequently
covered by an executed Change Order shall not be included in such computation,
provided that such Change Order is paid on a timely basis. In addition,
for work
performed under Change Directive, Owner shall pay Contractor’s costs of such
work plus the applicable fee (less retainage as provided herein) as part
of the
regular progress payment process pending finalization of a Change Order
adjusting the Contract Sum.




7
.Miscellaneous
Site/Design Issues.
With
respect to Contractor’s review of contract documents, design documents, field
conditions and submittals under Article 3 of the General Conditions, Contractor
shall perform only such review as is reasonable and customary in the industry.
Contractor is entitled to perform the Work in accordance with submittals
approved by the Architect. Contractor shall not be obligated to perform
any
design, architectural or engineering services unless, and only to the extent,
such services are specifically required to be performed by Contractor by
Contract Documents other than the General Conditions. Any such design,
architectural or engineering services required of Contractor shall be performed
according to reasonable standards of care applicable to such professional
services. Contractor shall not be responsible for the safety or adequacy
of
means, methods, techniques, sequences and procedures for the work specified
in
the Contract Documents.



8.
Time
of Performance.
Contractor will endeavor to substantially complete the work as required,
subject
to and conditioned on the delivery of the Notice to Proceed, final construction
plans and the issuance of all required building permits and approvals as
specified. The Contract Time and Contract Sum shall be adjusted to reflect
the
impacts of design and permit delays, material increases in the general
scope of
the project, changes, delays attributable to the Owner, Architect, and
other
factors beyond Contractor’s reasonable control. Owner recognizes that the
failure to provide final plans and all required building permits within
the time
set forth above will have a significant impact on project time and costs,
in
particular because of the potential for procurement delays and winter
conditions.





9.
INTENTIONALLY
DELETED









10.
Insurance.
To the
extent Contractor provides Builder’s Risk or other insurance applicable to the
Project, the Contractor shall pay the deductible associated with any claim.
Contractor’s insurance obligations shall be as set forth in the Insurance
Requirements Exhibit, rather than those in the General Conditions.




11.
Drawings.
Owner
shall have the responsibility to procure timely responses from the Architect
to
Contractor’s and Subcontractors’ requests for information or clarification
regarding the drawings or other aspects of the design or design intent.
Owner
acknowledges that the failure to provide timely responses to such requests
may
have a material impact on the progress of the Work. Contractor shall be
entitled
to an appropriate adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time from
any
failure to provide such requested information within a time frame consistent
with the project schedule.




12.
Schedule
of Values.
The
Contract Sum is effective with respect to the total cost of the work for
the
entire project. A schedule of values itemizing the categories of work
constituting the project, if not already established, shall be developed
and
agreed to by the parties. The schedule of values is informational only
as a
reference for billing and evaluation. However, actual costs in a category
may
vary from and exceed the scheduled value for that category, and the scheduled
value for a category shall not be construed as a limit to the costs that
may be
incurred in that category.







13
Contractor’s
Contingency.
The
schedule of values and Contract Sum shall include a contractor’s contingency
which contingency is for the sole use and benefit of the Contractor. Contractor
may use the contingency for any purpose relating to the project, including:
cost
overruns; delays; or; labor disputes; material or equipment price changes;
and
any other cost incurred by contractor in connection with the project Owner
recognizes that the contingency reflects the problems inherent in a project
of
this scale and that the Contract Sum is based in part on the availability
of
this contingency. The Contractor’s contingency is not available for use by or
for the benefit of the Owner or any other party, and shall not be used
to cover:
changes to the work; design revisions or problems; delays or interference
of the
Owner Architect or third parties for which Contractor is not responsible;
matters related to land use proceedings; unknown conditions; allowance
adjustments; unusually severe weather; or similar items for which Contractor
is
not responsible. The unused contingency will not be part of the shared
savings
should the final cost be less than the GMP.





























14.
Allowances.
The
Contract Sum may include allowances as identified in the Allowance Exhibit
or
other Contract Documents. The allowances are inserted to reflect costs
in
categories that have not been determined at the present time. Actual costs
will
depend on future decisions and selections, and may vary substantially from
the
allowance figures. The Allowances should not be viewed as a representation
regarding what the costs will actually be. On all allowance items, Contractor
shall be entitled to his actual cost plus the Contractor’s Fee. Where actual
costs exceed the allowance, the Contract Sum shall be increased by the
added
cost plus the Contractor’s Fee on those added costs; where actual costs are less
than the allowance, the Contract Sum shall be reduced by the amount by
which the
actual costs are less than the allowance.




15.
Labor
Rates.
Rates
for project personnel are set forth in the Labor Rate Exhibit L. The time
actually spent by such personnel on work or tasks related to the project
shall
be charged as a cost of the work at the hourly rates specified in Exhibit
L. For
the referenced personnel, these rates shall be used instead of actual costs
and
the other provisions of Article 7 of the Contract Form shall not apply.
The
parties have agreed to use these rates in part because of the difficulty
and
expense of determining actual labor costs. The labor rates cover all wages,
salaries, vacation or sick time, burden and direct or indirect expense
associated with such labor. Contractor shall be entitled to revise said
rates 12
months after the commencement date, provided that any increase is consistent
with (i) standard rates charged by Contractor, and (ii) increases in
construction labor rates in the local market generally. Notwithstanding
the
provisions of Articles 7 and 8 of the Contract Form, costs of personnel
at
Contractor’s principal office or other offices performing tasks specifically
related to the project shall be a recoverable project cost at the specified
rates.



16.
Equipment
Rates.
Rates
for equipment owned by Contractor (but not subcontractors) are attached
hereto
on the Equipment Rate Exhibit L. The time actually spent utilizing such
equipment on the project shall be charged as a cost of the work at the
rates
specified in the Equipment Rate Exhibit. These rates shall be used instead
of
attempting to determine actual costs, and the other provisions of Article
7 of
the Contract Form shall not apply. The parties have agreed to use these
rates in
part because of the difficulty and expense in determining actual costs.
The
equipment rates cover the acquisition of owned equipment, depreciation,
major
maintenance etc. but do not include the costs of transportation to and
from the
site, fuel, minor maintenance or the cost of associated operators. Contractor
shall be entitled to revise said rates 12 months after the commencement,
provided that any increase is consistent with (i) standard rates charged
by
Contractor, and (ii) increases in construction equipment rates in the local
market generally.




17.
Progress Payments.
Progress payments shall be calculated as follows:




A. Take
the
value of the completed work through the date of the Application for
Payment.




B. Add
the
costs of materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored at the site
for
subsequent incorporation in the Work, or if approved in advance by the
Owner,
suitably stored off the site at a location agreed upon in writing.





C. Add
the
Contractor’s Fee based on value of the completed work and stored material and
equipment.




D. Deduct
retainage in the amount of 10% of cost billings related to
subcontractors




E. Deduct
the aggregate of previous payment made by the Owner.

Owner
shall pay the balance so computed to Contractor.



18.
Documentation.
The
Application for Payment shall include information showing the costs incurred,
and a calculation showing the amount due. The Application need not include
underlying invoices or other cost documents, provided that Owner shall
have
access to such documents in accordance with Article 11 of the Contract
Form. The
costs and expenses associated with inspecting, auditing, copying or otherwise
reviewing Contractor’s cost data shall be a cost of the work.






























19.
Materials
Delivered to the Site.
‘Completed Work’ for purposes of billing shall include materials stored on site
for incorporation into the work or stored at an offsite location agreed
to by
Owner and Contractor.




20.

A. For
a
period of one year after substantial completion, Contractor warrants that
the
Work will be free from defects not inherent in the quality required or
permitted
and that the Work will conform to the requirements of the Contract Documents.

properly
approved and authorized, may be considered defective. The Contractor’s warranty
excludes remedy for damage or defect caused by abuse, modifications not
executed
by the Contractor, improper or insufficient maintenance, improper operation,
normal wear and tear and normal usages.




B. Where
the
work is comprised of separate buildings or areas that, upon substantial
completion of such building or areas, are separately used or occupied by
owner,
the one- year warranty period shall run from the date of substantial completion
of such building or area.




C. Owner
shall provide Contractor written notice of any warranty claims within the
one-year period, and Contractor shall have no responsibility for claims
or
defects for which such notice is not provided. Upon receipt of proper notice
of
claim, Contractor shall promptly repair or replace the defective work.

or
replace and the manner in which the work will be performed. Warranty work
shall
be performed to reasonable industry standards. Contractor’s sole responsibility
shall be to repair or replace the defective work, and Contractor shall
have no
responsibility for consequential or other damages.




D. This
warranty is in lieu of any other warranties or other remedy for defective
work,
express or implied and shall operate only for the benefit of the Owner
and its
successors in title.




21.

the
Contractor may pursue any remedy available at law or in equity,
including,
if applicable, termination for material default.










22.
Retainage.







A



When
the work is 50% complete, provided the Work is substantially
in compliance
with the Contract Documents and schedule, no further retainage
shall be
held.









B.
At
Contractor’s request, and provided the work is substantially in compliance with
the Contract Documents and schedule, the Owner shall release retainage
in an
amount equal to subcontractor retainage for any subcontract that has been
fully
performed and accepted so that final payment can be made on said subcontract.

































C.
Upon
substantial completion, all retention shall be forthwith paid to Contractor,
provided that Owner may withhold 150% of the estimated costs to complete
punch
list or other remaining work.



23.
Attorneys
Fees.
In the
event of any dispute, the court or arbitrator(s) as the case may be shall
have
authority, in the sound exercise of discretion, to award costs and attorneys
fees to the party whose position is substantially favored.







24.

Article 14.3
of the General Conditions for a period in excess of 60 days in
the
aggregate.











25.



Claims.
Contractor shall provide written notice of any claims, including
claims
for adjustment to the Contract Sum or Contract Time, change orders,
delays, concealed or unknown conditions, or other claim, within
a
reasonable time after the Contractor recognizes the condition
giving rise
to the Claim. Owner shall respond to any claim promptly and in
good faith,
and shall process any applicable change orders with due diligence.
In
accordance with paragraph 6, claim amounts that are not disputed
shall be

Overtime/Acceleration.
The Contract Sum shall be adjusted to reflect overtime or other
acceleration costs incurred by the Contractor, plus any applicable
fee, in
connection with any Leave in acceleration of the Project Schedule
approved
by Owner, Leave in Owners Agent. Nothing herein shall relieve

Work will be free from defects not inherent in the quality required or
permitted
and that the Work will conform to the requirements of the Contract Documents.

approved and authorized, may be considered defective. The Contractor’s warranty
excludes remedy for damage or defect caused by abuse, modifications not

normal wear and tear and normal usages.




Where
the
Work is comprised of separate building or areas that, upon substantial
completion of such building or areas, are separately used or occupied by
Owner,
the one-year warranty period shall run from the date of substantial completion
of such building or area.




Owner
shall provide Contractor written notice of any warranty claims within the
one-year period, and Contractor shall have no responsibility for claims
or
defects for which such notice is not provided. Upon receipt of proper notice
of
claim, Contractor shall promptly repair or replace the defective work.
Contractor shall, in its reasonable discretion, determine whether to repair
or
replace and the manner in which the work will be performed. Warranty work
shall
be performed to reasonable industry standards. Contractor’s sole responsibility
shall be to repair or replace the defective work, and Contractor shall
have no
responsibility for consequential or other damages.




This
warranty is in lieu of any other warranties or other remedy for defective
work,
express or implied and shall operate only for the benefit of the Owner
and its
successors in title.

ARTICLE
1 GENERAL PROVISIONS



§1.1
BASIC DEFINITIONS

§
1.1.1 THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

The
Contract Documents consist of the Agreement between Owner and Contractor
(hereinafter the Agreement), Conditions
of the Contract (General, Supplementary and other Conditions), Drawings,
Specifications, Addenda issued prior to execution of the Contract, other
documents listed in the Agreement and Modifications issued after execution
of
the Contract. A Modification is (1) a written amendment to the Contract signed
by both parties, (2) a Change
Order, (3) a Construction Change Directive or (4) a written order for a minor
change in the Work issued by the Architect. Unless specifically enumerated
in
the Agreement, the Contract Documents do not include other documents such as
bidding requirements (advertisement or invitation to bid, Instructions to
Bidders, sample forms, the
Contractor's bid or portions of Addenda relating to bidding
requirements).



§1.1.2
THE CONTRACT

The
Contract Documents form the Contract for Construction. The Contract represents
the entire and integrated agreement
between the parties hereto and supersedes prior negotiations, representations
or
agreements, either written or
oral.
The Contract may be amended or modified only by a Modification. The Contract
Documents shall not be construed to create a contractual relationship of any
kind (1) between the Architect and Contractor, (2) between the Owner and a
Subcontractor or Sub-subcontractor, (3) between the Owner and Architect or
(4)
between any persons or entities other than the Owner and Contractor. The
Architect shall, however, be entitled to performance and enforcement of
obligations under the Contract intended to facilitate performance of the
Architect's duties.



§1.1.3
THE WORK

The
term
"Work" means the construction and services required by the Contract Documents,
whether completed or partially completed, and includes all other labor,
materials, equipment and services provided or to be provided by the
Contractor to fulfill the Contractor's obligations. The Work may constitute
the
whole or a part of the Project.



§1.1.4
THE PROJECT

The
Project is the total construction of which the Work performed under the Contract
Documents may be the whole or a part and which may include construction by
the
Owner or by separate contractors.



§1.1.5
THE DRAWINGS

The
Drawings are the graphic and pictorial portions of the Contract Documents
showing the design, location and dimensions of the Work, generally including
plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules and diagrams.



§
1.1.6 THE SPECIFICATIONS

The
Specifications are that portion of the Contract Documents consisting of the
written requirements for materials, equipment, systems, standards and
workmanship for the Work, and performance of related services.



§
1.1.7 THE PROJECT MANUAL

The
Project Manual is a volume assembled for the Work which may include the bidding
requirements, sample forms, Conditions of the Contract and
Specifications.



§
1.2 CORRELATION AND INTENT OF THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS



§
1.2.1
The
intent of the Contract Documents is to include all items necessary for the
proper execution and completion of the Work by the Contractor. The Contract
Documents are complementary, and what is required by one
shall
be as binding as if required by all; performance by the Contractor shall be
required only to the extent consistent
with the Contract Documents and reasonably inferable from them as being
necessary to produce the indicated results.



§
1.2.2
Organization of the Specifications into divisions, sections and articles, and
arrangement of Drawings shall not control
the Contractor in dividing the Work among Subcontractors or in establishing
the
extent of Work to be performed
by any trade.



§
1.2.3
Unless
otherwise stated in the Contract Documents, words which have well-known
technical or construction industry
meanings are used in the Contract Documents in accordance with such recognized
meanings.







/s/ RR

/s/ LH

/s/ TS





































§1.3
CAPITALIZATION

§
1.3.1
Terms
capitalized in these General Conditions include those which are (1) specifically
defined, (2) the titles

of
numbered articles or (3) the titles of other documents published by the American
Institute of Architects.



§1.4
INTERPRETATION

§
1.4.1
In the
interest of brevity the Contract Documents frequently omit modifying words
such
as "all" and "any" and
articles such as "the" and "an," but the fact that a modifier or an article
is
absent from one statement and appears in another is not intended to affect
the
interpretation of either statement.



§
1.5 EXECUTION OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

§
1.5.1
The
Contract Documents shall be signed by the Owner and Contractor. If either the
Owner or Contractor or

both
do
not sign all the Contract Documents, the Architect shall identify such unsigned
Documents upon request.



§
1.5.2
Execution of the Contract by the Contractor is a representation that the
Contractor has visited the site, become
generally familiar with local conditions under which the Work is to be performed
and correlated personal observations
with requirements of the Contract Documents.



§
1.6 OWNERSHIP AND USE OF DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS OF
SERVICE

§
1.6.1 The
Drawings, Specifications and other documents, including those in electronic
form, prepared by the Architect and the Architect's consultants are Instruments
of Service through which the Work to be executed by the Contractor is described.
The Contractor may retain one record set. Neither the Contractor nor any
Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or material or equipment supplier shall own
or
claim a copyright in the Drawings, Specifications and other documents prepared
by the Architect or the Architect's consultants, and unless otherwise indicated
the Architect and the Architect's consultants shall be deemed the authors of
them and will retain all common law, statutory and other reserved rights, in
addition to the copyrights. All copies of Instruments of Service, except the
Contractor's
record set, shall be returned or suitably accounted for to the Architect, on
request, upon completion of the
Work.
The Drawings, Specifications and other documents prepared by the Architect
and
the Architect's consultants, and copies thereof furnished to the Contractor,
are
for use solely with respect to this Project. They are not
to be
used by the Contractor or any Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or material
or
equipment supplier on other projects
or for additions to this Project outside the scope of the Work without the
specific written consent of the Owner, Architect and the Architect's
consultants. The Contractor, Subcontractors, Sub-subcontractors and material
or
equipment suppliers are authorized to use and reproduce applicable portions
of
the Drawings, Specifications and other documents prepared by the Architect
and
the Architect's consultants appropriate to and for use in the execution of
their
Work under the Contract Documents. All copies made under this authorization
shall bear the statutory copyright notice, if any, shown on the Drawings,
Specifications and other documents prepared by the Architect and the Architect's
consultants. Submittal or distribution to meet official regulatory requirements
or for other purposes in connection with this Project is not to be construed
as
publication in derogation of the Architect's or
Architect's consultants' copyrights or other reserved rights.



ARTICLE
2 OWNER

§
2.1 GENERAL

§
2.1.1
The
Owner is the person or entity identified as such in the Agreement and is
referred to throughout the Contract
Documents as if singular in number. The Owner shall designate in writing a
representative who shall have express
authority to bind the Owner with respect to all matters requiring the Owner's
approval or authorization. Except
as
otherwise provided in Section 4.2.1, the Architect does not have such authority.
The term "Owner" means the
Owner
or the Owner's authorized representative.



§
2.1.2
The
Owner shall furnish to the Contractor within fifteen days after receipt of
a
written request, information necessary and relevant for the Contractor to
evaluate, give notice of or enforce mechanic's lien rights. Such information
shall include a correct statement of the record legal title to the property
on
which the Project is located, usually
referred to as the site, and the Owner's interest therein.



§
2.2 INFORMATION AND SERVICES REQUIRED OF THE OWNER

§
2.2.1
The
Owner shall, at the written request of the Contractor, prior to commencement
of
the Work and thereafter, furnish
to the Contractor reasonable evidence that financial arrangements have been
made
to fulfill the Owner's obligations under the Contract. Furnishing of such
evidence shall be a condition precedent to commencement or


/s/ RR

/s/ LH

/s/ TS








































continuation
of the Work. After such evidence has been furnished, the Owner shall not
materially vary such financial
arrangements without prior notice to the Contractor.



§
2.2.2
Except
for permits and fees, including those required under Section 3.7.1, which are
the responsibility of the Contractor
under the Contract Documents, the Owner shall secure and pay for necessary
approvals, easements, assessments
and charges required for construction, use or occupancy of permanent structures
or for permanent changes
in existing facilities.



§
2.2.3
The
Owner shall furnish surveys describing physical characteristics, legal
limitations and utility locations for the
site
of the Project, and a legal description of the site. The Contractor shall be
entitled to rely on the accuracy of information
furnished by the Owner but shall exercise proper precautions relating to the
safe performance of the Work.



§
2.2.4
Information or services required of the Owner by the Contract Documents shall
be
furnished by the Owner with
reasonable promptness. Any other information or services relevant to the
Contractor's performance of the Work under the Owner's control shall be
furnished by the Owner after receipt from the Contractor of a written
request
for such information or services.



§
2.2.5
Unless
otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, the Contractor will be furnished,
free of charge, such copies
of
Drawings and Project Manuals as are reasonably necessary for execution of the
Work.



§
2.3 OWNER'S RIGHT TO STOP THE WORK

§
2.3.1
If the
Contractor fails to correct Work which is not in accordance with the
requirements of the Contract Documents
as required by Section 12.2 or persistently fails to carry out Work in
accordance with the Contract Documents,
the Owner may issue a written order to the Contractor to stop the Work, or
any
portion thereof, until the cause
for
such order has been eliminated; however, the right of the Owner to stop the
Work
shall not give rise to a duty on the part of the Owner to exercise this right
for the benefit of the Contractor or any other person or entity, except to
the
extent required by Section 6.1.3.



§
2.4 OWNER'S RIGHT TO CARRY OUT THE WORK

§
2.4.1
If the
Contractor defaults or neglects to carry out the Work in accordance with the
Contract Documents and fails within a seven-day period after receipt of written
notice from the Owner to commence and continue correction of such default or
neglect with diligence and promptness, the Owner may after such seven-day period
give the Contractor
a second written notice to correct such deficiencies within a three-day period.
If the Contractor within such
three-day period after receipt of such second notice fails to commence and
continue to correct any deficiencies, the Owner may, without prejudice to other
remedies the Owner may have, correct such deficiencies. In such case an
appropriate
Change Order shall be issued deducting from payments then or thereafter due
the
Contractor the reasonable cost of correcting such deficiencies, including
Owner's expenses and compensation for the Architect's additional
services made necessary by such default, neglect or failure. Such action by
the
Owner and amounts charged
to the Contractor are both subject to prior approval of the Architect. If
payments then or thereafter due the Contractor
are not sufficient to cover such amounts, the Contractor shall pay the
difference to the Owner.



ARTICLE
3 CONTRACTOR



§
3.1 GENERAL



§
3.1.1
The
Contractor is the person or entity identified as such in the Agreement and
is
referred to throughout the Contract
Documents as if singular in number. The term "Contractor" means the Contractor
or the Contractor's authorized
representative.



§
3.1.2
The
Contractor shall perform the Work in accordance with the Contract
Documents.



§
3.1.3
The
Contractor shall not be relieved of obligations to perform the Work in
accordance with the Contract Documents either by activities or duties of the
Architect in the Architect's administration of the Contract, or by tests,
inspections
or approvals required or performed by persons other than the
Contractor.



§
3.2 REVIEW OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS AND FIELD CONDITIONS BY
CONTRACTOR

§
3.2.1
Since
the Contract Documents are complementary, before starting each portion of the
Work, the Contractor

shall
carefully study and compare the various Drawings and other Contract Documents
relative to that portion of the




/s/ RR

/s/ LH

/s/ TS



































Work,
as
well as the information furnished by the Owner pursuant to Section 2.2.3, shall
take field measurements of any
existing conditions related to that portion of the Work and shall observe any
conditions at the site affecting it. These obligations are for the purpose
of
facilitating construction by the Contractor and are not for the purpose of
discovering
errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in the Contract Documents; however, any
errors, inconsistencies or omissions
discovered by the Contractor shall be reported promptly to the Architect as
a
request for information in such
form
as the Architect may require.



§
3.2.2
Any
design errors or omissions noted by the Contractor during this review shall
be
reported promptly to the Architect,
but it is recognized that the Contractor's review is made in the Contractor's
capacity as a contractor and not as a licensed design professional unless
otherwise specifically provided in the Contract Documents. The Contractor
is not required to ascertain that the Contract Documents are in accordance
with
applicable laws, statutes, ordinances,
building codes, and rules and regulations, but any nonconformity discovered
by
or made known to the Contractor shall be reported promptly to the

are physical examples which illustrate materials, equipment or workmanship
and
establish standards
by which the Work will be judged.



§
3.12.4 Shop
Drawings, Product Data, Samples and similar submittals are not Contract
Documents. The purpose of their
submittal is to demonstrate for those portions of the Work for which submittals
are required by the Contract Documents
the way by which the Contractor proposes to conform to the information given
and
the design concept expressed in the Contract Documents. Review by the Architect
is subject to the limitations of Section 4.2.7. Informational submittals upon
which the Architect is not expected to take responsive action may be so
identified in the Contract Documents. Submittals which are not required by
the
Contract Documents may be returned by the Architect without action.



§
3.12.5 The
Contractor shall review for compliance with the Contract Documents, approve
and
submit to the Architect
Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples and similar submittals required by the

§
3.12.8 The
Work
shall be in accordance with approved submittals except that the Contractor
shall
not be relieved of responsibility
for deviations from requirements of the Contract Documents by the Architect's
approval of Shop Drawings, Product Data, Samples or similar submittals unless
the Contractor has specifically informed the Architect in
writing of such deviation at the time of submittal and (1) the Architect has
given written approval to the specific deviation
as a minor change in the Work, or (2) a Change Order or Construction Change
Directive has been issued authorizing the deviation. The Contractor shall not
be
relieved of responsibility for errors or omissions in Shop Drawings, Product
Data, Samples or similar submittals by the Architect's approval
thereof.



§
3.12.9 The
Contractor shall direct specific attention, in writing or on resubmitted Shop
Drawings, Product Data, Samples or similar submittals, to revisions other than

are
specifically required by the Contract Documents for a portion of the
Work
or unless the Contractor needs to provide such services in order to carry out
the Contractor's responsibilities
for construction means, methods, techniques, sequences and procedures. The
Contractor shall not be required
to provide professional services in violation of applicable law. If professional
design services or certifications by a design professional related to systems,
materials or equipment are specifically required of the Contractor
by the Contract Documents, the Owner and the Architect will specify all
performance and design criteria that
such
services must satisfy. The Contractor shall cause such services or
certifications to be provided by a properly licensed design professional, whose
signature and seal shall appear on all drawings, calculations, specifications,
certifications, Shop Drawings and other submittals prepared by such
professional. Shop Drawings and other submittals related to the Work designed
or
certified by such professional, if prepared by others, shall bear such
professional's written approval when submitted to the Architect. The Owner
and
the Architect shall be entitled to rely upon the adequacy, accuracy and
completeness of the services, certifications or approvals performed by such
design professionals, provided the Owner and Architect have specified to the
Contractor all performance and design criteria
that such services must satisfy. Pursuant to this Section 3.12.10, the Architect
will review, approve or take other appropriate action on submittals only for
the
limited purpose of checking for conformance with information given and the
design concept expressed in the Contract Documents. The Contractor shall not
be
responsible for the adequacy
of the performance or design criteria required by the Contract
Documents.

about
the
Project waste materials, rubbish, the Contractor's tools, construction
equipment, machinery and surplus

materials.

from loss on account thereof,
but shall not be responsible for such defense or loss when a particular design,
process or product of a particular
manufacturer or manufacturers is required by the Contract Documents or where
the
copyright violations are contained in Drawings, Specifications or other
documents prepared by the Owner or Architect. However, if the Contractor has
reason to believe that the required design, process or product is an
infringement of a copyright or a patent,
the Contractor shall be responsible for such loss unless such information is
promptly furnished to the Architect.

of
tangible property (other
than the Work itself), but only to the extent caused by the negligent acts
or
omissions of the Contractor, a Subcontractor,
anyone directly or indirectly employed by them or anyone for whose acts they
may
be liable, regardless of whether or not such claim, damage, loss or expense
is
caused in part by a party indemnified hereunder. Such
obligation shall not be construed to negate, abridge, or reduce other rights
or
obligations of indemnity which would otherwise exist as to a party or person
described in this Section 3.18.



§
3.18.2 In
claims
against any person or entity indemnified under this Section 3.18 by an employee

§
4.2.1
The
Architect will provide administration of the Contract as described in the
Contract Documents, and will be an
Owner's representative (1) during construction, (2) until final payment is
due
and (3) with the Owner's concurrence, from time to time during the one-year
period for correction of Work described in Section 12.2. The Architect
will have authority to act on behalf of the Owner only to the extent provided
in
the Contract Documents, unless otherwise modified in writing in accordance
with
other provisions of the Contract.



§
4.2.2
The
Architect, as a representative of the Owner, will visit the site at intervals
appropriate to the stage of the Contractor's
operations (1) to become generally familiar with and to keep the Owner informed
about the progress and
quality of the portion of the Work completed, (2) to endeavor to guard the
Owner
against defects and








/s/ RR

/s/ LH

/s/ TS



































deficiencies
in the Work, and (3) to determine in general if the Work is being performed
in a
manner indicating that the Work, when fully completed, will be in accordance
with the Contract Documents. However, the Architect will not
be
required to make exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check the
quality or quantity of the Work. The Architect will neither have control over
or
charge of, nor be responsible for, the construction means, methods, techniques,
sequences or procedures, or for the safety precautions and programs in
connection with the Work, since these
are
solely the Contractor's rights and responsibilities under the Contract
Documents, except as provided in Section
3.3.1.



§
4.2.3
The
Architect will not be responsible for the Contractor's failure to perform the
Work in accordance with the requirements

Architect will review and certify the amounts due the Contractor and will issue
Certificates for Payment in such amounts.



§
4.2.6
The
Architect will have authority to reject Work that does not conform to the
Contract Documents. Whenever the
Architect considers it necessary or advisable, the Architect will have authority
to require inspection or testing of the
Work
in accordance with Sections 13.5.2 and 13.5.3, whether or not such Work is
fabricated, installed or completed. However, neither this authority of the
Architect nor a decision made in good faith either to exercise or not to
exercise such authority shall give rise to a duty or responsibility of the
Architect to the Contractor, Subcontractors,
material and equipment suppliers, their agents or employees, or other persons
or
entities performing portions of the Work.



§
4.2.7
The
Architect will review and approve or take other appropriate action upon the
Contractor's submittals such as
Shop
Drawings, Product Data and Samples, but only for the limited purpose of checking
for conformance with information
given and the design concept expressed in the Contract Documents. The
Architect's action will be taken with
such
reasonable promptness as to cause no delay in the Work or in the activities
of
the Owner, Contractor or separate contractors, while allowing sufficient time
in
the Architect's professional judgment to permit adequate review.
Review of such submittals is not conducted for the purpose of determining the
accuracy and completeness of other
details such as dimensions and quantities, or for substantiating instructions
for installation or performance of equipment or systems, all of which remain
the
responsibility of the Contractor as required by the Contract Documents. The
Architect's review of the Contractor's submittals shall not relieve the
Contractor of the obligations under
Sections 3.3, 3.5 and 3.12. The Architect's review shall not constitute approval
of safety precautions or, unless otherwise specifically stated by the Architect,
of any construction means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures. The
Architect's approval of a specific item shall not indicate approval of an
assembly of which the item is
a
component.

Architect will prepare Change Orders and Construction Change Directives, and
may
authorize minor changes
in the Work as provided in Section 7.4.

Architect will interpret and decide matters concerning performance under and
requirements of, the Contract Documents on written request of either the Owner
or Contractor. The Architect's response to such requests will be made in writing
within any time limits agreed upon or otherwise with reasonable promptness.
If
no agreement is made concerning the time within which interpretations required
of the Architect shall be furnished in compliance with this Section 4.2, then
delay shall not be recognized on account of failure by the Architect to furnish
such interpretations until 15 days after written request is made for
them.



§
4.2.12 Interpretations
and decisions of the Architect will be consistent with the intent of and
reasonably inferable from the Contract Documents and will be in writing or
in
the form of drawings. When making such interpretations and

both Owner and Contractor, will not
show
partiality to either and will not be liable for results of interpretations
or
decisions so rendered in good faith.

§
4.3 CLAIMS AND DISPUTES



§
4.3.1
Definition. A Claim is a demand or assertion by one of the parties seeking,
as a
matter of right, adjustment or interpretation of Contract terms, payment of
money, extension of time or other relief with respect to the terms of the
Contract.
The term "Claim" also includes other disputes and matters in question between
the Owner and Contractor arising out of or relating to the Contract. Claims
must
be initiated by written notice. The responsibility to substantiate
Claims shall rest with the party making the Claim.



§
4.3.2
Time
Limits on Claims. Claims by either party must be initiated within 21 days after
occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claim or within 21 days after the
claimant first recognizes the condition giving rise to the Claim, whichever
is later. Claims must be initiated by written notice to the Architect and the
other party.



§
4.3.3
Continuing Contract Performance. Pending final resolution of a Claim except
as
otherwise agreed in writing or
as
provided in Section 9.7.1 and Article 14, the Contractor shall proceed
diligently with performance of the Contract
and the Owner shall continue to make payments in accordance with the Contract
Documents.



§
4.3.4
Claims
for Concealed or Unknown Conditions. If conditions are encountered at the site
which are (1) subsurface or otherwise concealed physical conditions which differ
materially from those indicated in the Contract Documents or (2) unknown
physical conditions of an unusual nature, which differ materially from those
ordinarily found
to
exist and generally recognized as inherent in construction activities of the
character provided for in the Contract
Documents, then notice by the observing party shall be given to the other party
promptly before conditions are disturbed and in no event later than 21 days
after first observance of the conditions. The Architect will promptly
investigate
such conditions and, if they differ materially and cause an increase or decrease
in the Contractor's cost of, or time required for, performance of any part
of
the Work, will recommend an equitable adjustment in the Contract
Sum or Contract Time, or both. If the Architect determines that the conditions
at the site are not materially different
from those indicated in the Contract Documents and that no change in the terms
of the Contract is justified, the
Architect shall so notify the Owner and Contractor in writing, stating the
reasons. Claims by either party in opposition to such determination must be
made
within 21 days after the Architect has given notice of the decision. If the
conditions encountered are materially different, the Contract Sum and Contract
Time shall be equitably adjusted, but
if
the Owner and Contractor cannot agree on an adjustment in the Contract Sum
or
Contract Time, the adjustment shall be referred to the Architect for initial
determination, subject to further proceedings pursuant to Section
4.4.



§
4.3.5
Claims
for Additional Cost. If the Contractor wishes to make Claim for an increase
in
the Contract Sum, written notice as provided herein shall be given before
proceeding to execute the Work. Prior notice is not required for Claims relating
to an emergency endangering life or property arising under Section
10.6.



§
4.3.6
If the
Contractor believes additional cost is involved for reasons including but not
limited to (1) a written interpretation from the Architect, (2) an order by
the
Owner to stop the Work where the Contractor was not at fault, (3)
a
written order for a minor change in the Work issued by the Architect, (4)
failure of payment by the Owner, (5) termination
of the Contract by the Owner, (6) Owner's suspension or (7) other reasonable
grounds, Claim shall be filed
in
accordance with this Section 4.3.

§
4.3.7
Claims
for Additional Time

§
4.3.7.1 If
the
Contractor wishes to make Claim for an increase in the Contract Time, written
notice as provided herein
shall be given. The Contractor's Claim shall include an estimate of cost and
of
probable effect of delay on progress of the Work. In the case of a continuing
delay only one Claim is necessary.



§
4.3.7.2 If
adverse weather conditions are the basis for a Claim for additional time, such
Claim shall be documented by data substantiating that weather conditions were
abnormal for the period of time, could not have been reasonably anticipated
and had an adverse effect on the scheduled construction.



§
4.3.8
Injury
or Damage to Person or Property. If either party to the Contract suffers injury
or damage to person or property because of an act or omission of the other
party, or of others for whose acts such party is legally responsible, written
notice of such injury or damage, whether or not insured, shall be given to
the
other party within a
reasonable time not exceeding 21 days after discovery. The notice shall provide
sufficient detail to enable the other party to investigate the
matter.



§
4.3.9
If unit
prices are stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed upon, and
if
quantities originally contemplated
are materially changed in a proposed Change Order or Construction Change
Directive so that application of such unit prices to quantities of Work proposed
will cause substantial inequity to the Owner or Contractor, the applicable
unit
prices shall be equitably adjusted.



§
4.3.10 Claims
for Consequential Damages. The Contractor and Owner waive Claims against each
other for consequential
damages arising out of or relating to this Contract. This mutual waiver
includes:

and
reputation, and for loss of profit except anticipated profit arising directly
from the Work.



This
mutual waiver is applicable, without limitation, to all consequential damages
due to either party's termination in
accordance with Article 14. Nothing contained in this Section 4.3.10 shall
be
deemed to preclude an award of liquidated
direct damages, when applicable, in accordance with the requirements of the
Contract Documents.



§
4.4 RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS AND DISPUTES

§
4.4.1
Decision
of Architect. Claims, including those alleging an error or omission by the
Architect but excluding those arising under Sections 10.3 through 10.5, shall
be
referred initially to the Architect for decision. An initial decision by the
Architect shall be required as a condition precedent to mediation, arbitration
or litigation of all Claims
between the Contractor and Owner arising prior to the date final payment is
due,
unless 30 days have passed after
the
Claim has been referred to the Architect with no decision having been rendered
by the Architect. The Architect will not decide disputes between the Contractor
and persons or entities other than the Owner.



§
4.4.2
The
Architect will review Claims and within ten days of the receipt of the Claim
take one or more of the following actions: (1) request additional supporting
data from the claimant or a response with supporting data from the
other
party, (2) reject the Claim in whole or in part, (3) approve the Claim, (4)
suggest a compromise, or (5) advise
the parties that the Architect is unable to resolve the Claim if the Architect
lacks sufficient information to evaluate
the merits of the Claim or if the Architect concludes that, in the Architect's
sole discretion, it would be inappropriate
for the Architect to resolve the Claim.



§
4.4.3
In
evaluating Claims, the Architect may, but shall not be obligated to, consult
with or seek information from either
party or from persons with special knowledge or expertise who may assist the
Architect in rendering a decision. The Architect may request the Owner to
authorize retention of such persons at the Owner's expense.



§
4.4.4
If the
Architect requests a party to provide a response to a Claim or to furnish
additional supporting data, such
party shall respond, within ten days after receipt of such request, and shall
either provide a response on the requested
supporting data, advise the Architect when the response or supporting data
will
be furnished or advise the Architect
that no supporting data will be furnished. Upon receipt of the response or
supporting data, if any, the Architect will either reject or approve the Claim
in whole or in part.

§
4.4.5
The
Architect will approve or reject Claims by written decision, which shall state
the reasons therefor and which shall notify the parties of any change in the
Contract Sum or Contract Time or both. The approval or rejection of
a
Claim by the Architect shall be final and binding on the parties but subject
to
mediation and arbitration.



§
4.4.6
When a
written decision of the Architect states that (1) the decision is final but
subject to mediation and arbitration
and (2) a demand for arbitration of a Claim covered by such decision must be
made within 30 days after the
date
on which the party making the demand receives the final written decision, then
failure to demand arbitration within
said 30 days' period shall result in the Architect's decision becoming final
and
binding upon the Owner and Contractor. If the Architect renders a decision
after
arbitration proceedings have been initiated, such decision may be
entered as evidence, but shall not supersede arbitration proceedings unless
the
decision is acceptable to all parties concerned.



§
4.4.7
Upon
receipt of a Claim against the Contractor or at any time thereafter, the
Architect or the Owner may, but is
not
obligated to, notify the surety, if any, of the nature and amount of the Claim.
If the Claim relates to a possibility of a Contractor's default, the Architect
or the Owner may, but is not obligated to, notify the surety and request the
surety's assistance in resolving the controversy.



§
4.4.8
If a
Claim relates to or is the subject of a mechanic's lien, the party asserting
such Claim may proceed in accordance with applicable law to comply with the
lien
notice or filing deadlines prior to resolution of the Claim by the Architect,
by
mediation or by arbitration.



§
4.5 MEDIATION

§
4.5.1
Any
Claim arising out of or related to the Contract, except Claims relating to
aesthetic effect and except those waived
as
provided for in Sections 4.3.10, 9.10.4 and 9.10.5 shall, after initial decision
by the Architect or 30 days after submission of the Claim to the Architect,
be
subject to mediation as a condition precedent to arbitration or the institution
of legal or equitable proceedings by either party.



§
4.5.2
The
parties shall endeavor to resolve their Claims by mediation which, unless the
parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be in accordance with the Construction
Industry Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association
currently in effect. Request for mediation shall be filed in writing with the
other party to the Contract and
with
the American Arbitration Association. The request may be made concurrently
with
the filing of a demand for arbitration but, in such event, mediation shall
proceed in advance of arbitration or legal or equitable proceedings,
which
shall be stayed pending mediation for a period of 60 days from the date of
filing, unless stayed for a longer period by agreement of the parties or court
order.



§
4.5.3
The
parties shall share the mediator's fee and any filing fees equally. The
mediation shall be held in the place where the Project is located, unless
another location is mutually agreed upon. Agreements reached in mediation shall
be enforceable as settlement agreements in any court having jurisdiction
thereof.



§
4.6 ARBITRATION



§

as
provided for in Sections 4.3.10, 9.10.4 and 9.10.5, shall, after decision by

to arbitration. Prior to arbitration, the parties shall endeavor to resolve
disputes by mediation in accordance with the provisions of Section
4.5.



§
4.6.2
Claims
not resolved by mediation shall be decided by arbitration which, unless the
parties mutually agree otherwise,
shall be in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of
the
American Arbitration Association currently in effect. The demand for arbitration
shall be filed in writing with the other party to the Contract
and with the American Arbitration Association, and a copy shall be filed with
the Architect.



§
4.6.3
A demand
for arbitration shall be made within the time limits specified in Sections
4.4.6
and 4.6.1 as applicable, and in other cases within a reasonable time after
the
Claim has arisen, and in no event shall it be made after
the
date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such Claim
would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations as determined pursuant
to Section 13.7.

employees or consultants, except by written consent containing specific
reference to the Agreement and signed by the Architect, Owner, Contractor

other person or entity sought to be joined. No arbitration shall include, by
consolidation or joinder or in any other
manner, parties other than the Owner, Contractor, a separate contractor as
described in Article 6 and other persons substantially involved in a common
question of fact or law whose presence is required if complete relief is to

accorded in arbitration. No person or entity other than the Owner, Contractor
or
a separate contractor as described in Article 6 shall be included as an original
third party or additional third party to an arbitration whose interest or
responsibility is insubstantial. Consent to arbitration involving an additional
person or entity shall not constitute consent to arbitration of a Claim not
described therein or with a person or entity not named or described therein.
The
foregoing agreement to arbitrate and other agreements to arbitrate with an
additional person or entity duly consented to by parties to the Agreement shall
be specifically enforceable under applicable law in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.

arbitration must assert in the demand
all Claims then known to that party on which arbitration is permitted to be
demanded.

after award of the Contract, shall furnish in writing to the Owner through
the
Architect the names of persons or entities (including those who are to furnish

Owner
or Architect has made reasonable
and timely objection. The Contractor shall not be required to contract with
anyone to whom the Contractor has made reasonable objection.

By
appropriate agreement, written where legally required for validity, the

to the extent of the Work to be performed by the Subcontractor, to be bound
to
the Contractor by terms of the Contract Documents, and to assume toward the
Contractor all the obligations and responsibilities, including the
responsibility for safety of the Subcontractor's Work, which the Contractor,
by
these Documents, assumes toward the Owner and Architect. Each subcontract
agreement shall preserve and protect the rights of the Owner and Architect
under
the Contract Documents with respect to the Work to be performed by the
Subcontractor so
that
subcontracting thereof will not prejudice such rights, and shall allow to the
Subcontractor, unless specifically provided

redress against the Contractor that the Contractor, by the Contract Documents,
has against the Owner. Where appropriate, the Contractor shall require each
Subcontractor to enter into similar agreements with Sub-subcontractors. The
Contractor
shall make available to each proposed Subcontractor, prior to the execution
of
the subcontract agreement, copies
of
the Contract Documents to which the Subcontractor will be bound, and, upon
written request of the Subcontractor,

under
bond relating to the Contract.

Subcontractor's compensation
shall be equitably adjusted for increases in cost resulting from the
suspension.

own
forces, and to award separate contracts in connection with other portions of
the
Project or other construction or

operations
on the site under Conditions of the Contract identical or substantially similar

separate Owner-Contractor Agreement.



§
6.1.3
The
Owner shall provide for coordination of the activities of the Owner's own forces
and of each separate contractor with the Work of the Contractor, who shall
cooperate with them. The Contractor shall participate with other separate
contractors and the Owner in reviewing their construction schedules when
directed to do so. The Contractor
shall make any revisions to the construction schedule deemed necessary after
a
joint review and mutual agreement.
The construction schedules shall then constitute the schedules to be used by
the
Contractor, separate contractors
and the Owner until subsequently revised.



§
6.1.4
Unless
otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, when the Owner performs
construction or operations related
to the Project with the Owner's own forces, the Owner shall be deemed to be
subject to the same obligations and
to
have the same rights which apply to the Contractor under the Conditions of
the
Contract, including, without excluding others, those stated in Article 3, this
Article 6 and Articles 10, 11 and 12.

construction or operations by the
Owner
or a separate contractor, the Contractor shall, prior to proceeding with that
portion of the Work, promptly report
to
the Architect apparent discrepancies or defects in such other construction
that
would render it unsuitable for
such
proper execution and results. Failure of the Contractor so to report shall

is fit and proper to receive the Contractor's Work, except as to defects not
then reasonably discoverable.



§
6.2.3
The
Owner shall be reimbursed by the Contractor for costs incurred by the Owner
which are payable to a separate contractor because of delays, improperly timed

§
7.3.1 A Construction Change Directive is a written order prepared by
the Architect and signed by the Owner and Architect, directing a change in
the
Work prior to agreement on adjustment, if any, in the Contract Sum or Contract
Time, or both. The Owner may by Construction Change Directive, without
invalidating the Contract, order changes in
the
Work within the general scope of the Contract consisting of additions, deletions
or other revisions, the Contract

§
7.3.3
If the
Construction Change Directive provides for an adjustment to the Contract Sum,
the adjustment shall be based
on
one of the following methods:



.1



mutual
acceptance of a lump sum properly itemized and supported by sufficient
substantiating data to permit
evaluation;








.2



unit
prices stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed
upon;








.3


cost
to be determined in a manner agreed upon by the parties and a mutually
acceptable fixed or percentage
fee; or








.4



as
provided in Section 7.3.6.








§

Upon
receipt of a Construction Change Directive, the Contractor shall promptly

in
the Contract Sum or Contract
Time.



§
7.3.5
A
Construction Change Directive signed by the Contractor indicates the agreement
of the Contractor therewith,
including adjustment in Contract Sum and Contract Time or the method for
determining them. Such agreement
shall be effective immediately and shall be recorded as a Change
Order.



§
7.3.6
If the
Contractor does not respond promptly or disagrees with the method for adjustment
in the Contract Sum, the
method and the adjustment shall be determined by the Architect on the basis
of
reasonable expenditures and savings of those performing the Work attributable
to
the change, including, in case of an increase in the Contract Sum, a reasonable
allowance for overhead and profit. In such case, and also under Section 7.3.3.3,
the Contractor shall
keep and present, in such form as the Architect may prescribe, an itemized
accounting together with appropriate
supporting data. Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, costs
for
the purposes of this Section
7.3.6 shall be limited to the following:



.1

fringe benefits required
by agreement or custom, and workers' compensation insurance;

.4


costs
of premiums for all bonds and insurance, permit fees, and sales,
use or
similar taxes related to the Work; and









.5


additional
costs of supervision and field office personnel directly attributable
to
the change.








§
7.3.7
The
amount of credit to be allowed by the Contractor to the Owner for a deletion
or
change which results in a net
decrease in the Contract Sum shall be actual net cost as confirmed by the
Architect. When both additions and credits covering related Work or
substitutions are involved in a change, the allowance for overhead and profit
shall be
figured on the basis of net increase, if any, with respect to that
change.



§
7.3.8
Pending
final determination of the total cost of a Construction Change Directive to
the
Owner, amounts not in dispute
for such changes in the Work shall be included in Applications for Payment
accompanied by a Change Order indicating the parties' agreement with part or
all
of such costs. For any portion of such cost that remains in dispute,
the Architect will make an interim determination for purposes of monthly
certification for payment for those costs.
That determination of cost shall adjust the Contract Sum on the same basis
as a
Change Order, subject to the right of either party to disagree and assert a
claim in accordance with Article 4.



§
7.3.9
When the
Owner and Contractor agree with the determination made by the Architect
concerning the adjustments
in the Contract Sum and Contract Time, or otherwise reach agreement upon the
adjustments, such agreement
shall be effective immediately and shall be recorded by preparation and
execution of an appropriate Change
Order.



§
7.4 MINOR CHANGES IN THE WORK

§
7.4.1
The
Architect will have authority to order minor changes in the Work not involving

The
issuance of a Certificate for Payment will constitute a representation by the
Architect to the Owner, based on the Architect's evaluation of the Work and
the
data comprising the Application for Payment, that the Work has
progressed to the point indicated and that, to the best of the Architect's
knowledge, information and belief, the quality of the Work is in accordance
with
the Contract Documents. The foregoing representations are subject to an
evaluation of the Work for conformance with the Contract Documents upon
Substantial Completion, to results of subsequent
tests and inspections, to correction of minor deviations from the Contract
Documents prior to completion and
to
specific qualifications expressed by the Architect. The issuance of a
Certificate for Payment will further constitute a representation that the
Contractor is entitled to payment in the amount certified. However, the issuance
of
a
Certificate for Payment will not be a representation that the Architect has
(1)
made exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or
quantity of the Work, (2) reviewed construction means, methods, techniques,
sequences
or procedures, (3) reviewed copies of requisitions received from Subcontractors
and material suppliers and
other
data requested by the Owner to substantiate the Contractor's right to payment,
or (4) made examination to ascertain how or for what purpose the Contractor
has
used money previously paid on account of the Contract Sum.



§
9.5 DECISIONS TO WITHHOLD CERTIFICATION

§
9.5.1
The
Architect may withhold a Certificate for Payment in whole or in part, to the
extent reasonably necessary to
protect the Owner, if in the Architect's opinion the representations to the
Owner required by Section 9.4.2 cannot be made. If the Architect is unable
to
certify payment in the amount of the Application, the Architect will notify
the
Contractor
and Owner as provided in Section 9.4.1. If the Contractor and Architect cannot
agree on a revised amount,
the Architect will promptly issue a Certificate for Payment for the amount
for
which the Architect is able to make
such
representations to the Owner. The Architect may also withhold a Certificate
for
Payment or, because of subsequently
discovered evidence, may nullify the whole or a part of a Certificate for
Payment previously issued, to such
extent as may be necessary in the Architect's opinion to protect the Owner
from
loss for which the Contractor is responsible, including loss resulting from
acts
and omissions described in Section 3.3.2, because of:



.1


defective
Work not remedied;

/s/ LH

/s/ TS








































.2


third
party claims filed or reasonable evidence indicating probable filing
of
such claims unless security
acceptable to the Owner is provided by the Contractor;









.3


failure
of the Contractor to make payments properly to Subcontractors or
for
labor, materials or equipment;








.4


reasonable
evidence that the Work cannot be completed for the unpaid balance
of the
Contract Sum;








.5


damage
to the Owner or another contractor;









.6


reasonable
evidence that the Work will not be completed within the Contract
Time, and
that the unpaid
balance would not be adequate to cover actual or liquidated damages
for
the anticipated delay; or









.7


persistent
failure to carry out the Work in accordance with the Contract
Documents.








§
9.5.2
When the
above reasons for withholding certification are removed, certification will
be
made for amounts previously
withheld.



§
9.6 PROGRESS PAYMENTS

§
9.6.1
After
the Architect has issued a Certificate for Payment, the Owner shall make payment
in the manner and

within
the time provided in the Contract Documents, and shall so notify the
Architect.



§
9.6.2
The
Contractor shall promptly pay each Subcontractor, upon receipt of payment from
the Owner, out of the amount
paid to the Contractor on account of such Subcontractor's portion of the Work,
the amount to which said Subcontractor is entitled, reflecting percentages
actually retained from payments to the Contractor on account of such
Subcontractor's portion of the Work. The Contractor shall, by appropriate
agreement with each Subcontractor, require each Subcontractor to make payments
to Sub-subcontractors in a similar manner.



§
9.6.3
The
Architect will, on request, furnish to a Subcontractor, if practicable,
information regarding percentages of completion
or amounts applied for by the Contractor and action taken thereon by the
Architect and Owner on account of portions of the Work done by such
Subcontractor.



§
9.6.4
Neither
the Owner nor Architect shall have an obligation to pay or to see to the payment
of money to a Subcontractor
except as may otherwise be required by law.



§
9.6.5
Payment
to material suppliers shall be treated in a manner similar to that provided
in
Sections 9.6.2, 9.6.3 and 9.6.4.



§
9.6.6
A
Certificate for Payment, a progress payment, or partial or entire use or
occupancy of the Project by the Owner
shall not constitute acceptance of Work not in accordance with the Contract
Documents.



§
9.6.7
Unless
the Contractor provides the Owner with a payment bond in the full penal sum
of
the Contract Sum, payments received by the Contractor for Work properly
performed by Subcontractors and suppliers shall be held by the
Contractor for those Subcontractors or suppliers who performed Work or furnished
materials, or both, under contract
with the Contractor for which payment was made by the Owner. Nothing contained
herein shall require money to be placed in a separate account and not commingled
with money of the Contractor, shall create any fiduciary liability or tort
liability on the part of the Contractor for breach of trust or shall entitle
any
person or entity to an award of punitive damages against the Contractor for
breach of the requirements of this provision.



§
9.7 FAILURE OF PAYMENT

§
9.7.1
If the
Architect does not issue a Certificate for Payment, through no fault of the
Contractor, within seven days after
receipt of the Contractor's Application for Payment, or if the Owner does not
pay the Contractor within seven days after the date established in the Contract
Documents the amount certified by the Architect or awarded by arbitration,
then the Contractor may, upon seven additional days' written notice to the
Owner
and Architect, stop the Work until payment of the amount owing has been
received. The Contract Time shall be extended appropriately and the
Contract Sum shall be increased by the amount of the Contractor's reasonable
costs of shut-down, delay and start-up,
plus interest as provided for in the Contract Documents.

§
9.8 SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION



§
9.8.1
Substantial Completion is the stage in the progress of the Work when the Work
or
designated portion thereof is sufficiently complete in accordance with the
Contract Documents so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work for its
intended use.



§
9.8.2
When the
Contractor considers that the Work, or a portion thereof which the Owner agrees
to accept separately, is substantially complete, the Contractor shall prepare
and submit to the Architect a comprehensive list of items
to
be completed or corrected prior to final payment. Failure to include an item
on
such list does not alter the responsibility of the Contractor to complete all
Work in accordance with the Contract Documents.



§
9.8.3
Upon
receipt of the Contractor's list, the Architect will make an inspection to
determine whether the Work or designated
portion thereof is substantially complete. If the Architect's inspection
discloses any item, whether or not included
on the Contractor's list, which is not sufficiently complete in accordance
with
the Contract Documents so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work or
designated portion thereof for its intended use, the Contractor shall, before
issuance of the Certificate of Substantial Completion, complete or correct
such
item upon notification by the Architect. In such case, the Contractor shall
then
submit a request for another inspection by the Architect to determine
Substantial Completion.



§
9.8.4
When the
Work or designated portion thereof is substantially complete, the Architect
will
prepare a Certificate
of Substantial Completion which shall establish the date of Substantial
Completion, shall establish responsibilities of the Owner and Contractor for
security, maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and insurance,
and shall fix the time within which the Contractor shall finish all items on
the
list accompanying the Certificate. Warranties required by the Contract Documents
shall commence on the date of Substantial Completion of
the
Work or designated portion thereof unless otherwise provided in the Certificate
of Substantial Completion.



§
9.8.5
The
Certificate of Substantial Completion shall be submitted to the Owner and
Contractor for their written acceptance
of responsibilities assigned to them in such Certificate. Upon such acceptance
and consent of surety, if any,
the
Owner shall make payment of retainage applying to such Work or designated
portion thereof. Such payment shall
be
adjusted for Work that is incomplete or not in accordance with the requirements
of the Contract Documents.



§
9.9 PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OR USE

§
9.9.1
The
Owner may occupy or use any completed or partially completed portion of the
Work
at any stage when such portion is designated by separate agreement with the
Contractor, provided such occupancy or use is consented to by the insurer as
required under Section 11.4.1.5 and authorized by public authorities having
jurisdiction over the Work. Such partial occupancy or use may commence whether
or not the portion is substantially complete, provided the Owner and Contractor
have accepted in writing the responsibilities assigned to each of them for
payments, retainage,
if any, security, maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and
insurance, and have agreed in writing
concerning the period for correction of the Work and commencement of warranties
required by the Contract Documents.
When the Contractor considers a portion substantially complete, the Contractor
shall prepare and submit
a
list to the Architect as provided under Section 9.8.2. Consent of the Contractor
to partial occupancy or use shall not be unreasonably withheld. The stage of
the
progress of the Work shall be determined by written agreement between
the Owner and Contractor or, if no agreement is reached, by decision of the
Architect.



§
9.9.2
Immediately prior to such partial occupancy or use, the Owner, Contractor and
Architect shall jointly inspect the
area
to be occupied or portion of the Work to be used in order to determine and
record the condition of the Work.



§
9.9.3
Unless
otherwise agreed upon, partial occupancy or use of a portion or portions of
the
Work shall not constitute
acceptance of Work not complying with the requirements of the Contract
Documents.



§
9.10 FINAL COMPLETION AND FINAL PAYMENT

§
9.10.1 Upon
receipt of written notice that the Work is ready for final inspection and
acceptance and upon receipt of a final Application for Payment, the Architect
will promptly make such inspection and, when the Architect finds the Work
acceptable under the Contract Documents and the Contract fully performed, the
Architect will promptly issue a
final
Certificate for Payment stating that to the best of the Architect's knowledge,
information and belief, and on the basis of the Architect's on-site visits
and
inspections, the Work has been completed in accordance with terms and conditions
of the Contract Documents and that the entire balance found to be due the
Contractor and noted in




/s/ RR

/s/ LH

/s/ TS



































the
final
Certificate is due and payable. The Architect's final Certificate for Payment
will constitute a further representation
that conditions listed in Section 9.10.2 as precedent to the Contractor's being
entitled to final payment have been fulfilled.



§
9.10.2 Neither
final payment nor any remaining retained percentage shall become due until
the
Contractor submits to
the
Architect (1) an affidavit that payrolls, bills for materials and equipment,
and
other indebtedness connected with the Work for which the Owner or the Owner's
property might be responsible or encumbered (less amounts withheld
by Owner) have been paid or otherwise satisfied, (2) a certificate evidencing
that insurance required by the Contract Documents to remain in force after
final
payment is currently in effect and will not be canceled or allowed to
expire
until at least 30 days' prior written notice has been given to the Owner, (3)
a
written statement that the Contractor knows of no substantial reason that the
insurance will not be renewable to cover the period required by the
Contract Documents, (4) consent of surety, if any, to final payment and (5),
if
required by the Owner, other data establishing payment or satisfaction of
obligations, such as receipts, releases and waivers of liens, claims, security
interests
or encumbrances arising out of the Contract, to the extent and in such form
as
may be designated by the Owner.
If
a Subcontractor refuses to furnish a release or waiver required by the Owner,
the Contractor may furnish a bond satisfactory to the Owner to indemnify the
Owner against such lien. If such lien remains unsatisfied after payments are
made, the Contractor shall refund to the Owner all money that the Owner may
be
compelled to pay in discharging
such lien, including all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.



§
9.10.3 If,
after
Substantial Completion of the Work, final completion thereof is materially
delayed through no fault of
the
Contractor or by issuance of Change Orders affecting final completion, and
the
Architect so confirms, the Owner shall, upon application by the Contractor
and
certification by the Architect, and without terminating the Contract, make
payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed and
accepted. If the remaining balance for Work not fully completed or corrected
is
less than retainage stipulated in the Contract Documents, and if bonds have
been
furnished, the written consent of surety to payment of the balance due for
that
portion of the Work fully completed and accepted shall be submitted by the
Contractor to the Architect prior to certification
of such payment. Such payment shall be made under terms and conditions governing
final payment, except that it shall not constitute a waiver of
claims.



§
9.10.4 The
making of final payment shall constitute a waiver of Claims by the Owner except
those arising from:



.1



liens,
Claims, security interests or encumbrances arising out of the Contract
and
unsettled;








.2


failure
of the Work to comply with the requirements of the Contract Documents;
or









.3


terms
of special warranties required by the Contract
Documents.








§
9.10.5 Acceptance
of final payment by the Contractor, a Subcontractor or material supplier shall
constitute a waiver
of
claims by that payee except those previously made in writing and identified
by
that payee as unsettled at the
time
of final Application for Payment.

the Owner shall furnish in writing
to the Contractor and Architect the names and qualifications of persons or
entities who are to perform tests verifying the presence or absence of such
material or substance or who are to perform the task of removal or safe
containment of such material or substance. The Contractor and the Architect
will
promptly reply to the Owner in writing stating whether or not either has
reasonable objection to the persons or entities proposed by the Owner. If either
the Contractor or Architect has an objection to a person or entity proposed
by
the Owner, the Owner shall propose another to whom the Contractor and the
Architect have no reasonable objection. When the material or substance
has been rendered harmless, Work in the affected area shall resume upon written

or both, at or adjacent to
the
site by property insurance under policies separate from those insuring the

otherwise.

covered by property insurance obtained pursuant to this Section 11.4 or other
property insurance applicable to the Work, except such rights as they
have
to
proceeds of such insurance held by the Owner as fiduciary. The Owner or
Contractor, as appropriate, shall require of the Architect, Architect's
consultants, separate contractors described in Article 6, if any, and the
subcontractors,
sub-subcontractors, agents and employees of any of them, by appropriate
agreements, written where legally
required for validity, similar waivers each in favor of other parties enumerated
herein. The policies shall provide
such waivers of subrogation by endorsement or otherwise. A waiver of subrogation
shall be effective as to a person
or
entity even though that person or entity would otherwise have a duty of
indemnification, contractual or otherwise, did not pay the insurance premium
directly or indirectly, and whether or not the person or entity had an
insurable
interest in the property damaged.



§
11.4.8 A
loss
insured under Owner's property insurance shall be adjusted by the Owner as
fiduciary and made payable
to the Owner as fiduciary for the insureds, as their interests may appear,
subject to requirements of any applicable
mortgagee clause and of Section 11.4.10. The Contractor shall pay Subcontractors
their just shares of insurance proceeds received by the Contractor, and by
appropriate agreements, written where legally required for validity, shall
require Subcontractors to make payments to their Sub-subcontractors in similar
manner.



§
11.4.9
If
required in writing by a party in interest, the Owner as fiduciary shall, upon
occurrence of an insured loss, give
bond
for proper performance of the Owner's duties. The cost of required bonds shall
be charged against proceeds received as fiduciary. The Owner shall deposit
in a
separate account proceeds so received, which the Owner
shall distribute in accordance with such agreement as the parties in interest
may reach, or in accordance with an
arbitration award in which case the procedure shall be as provided in Section
4.6. If after such loss no other special
agreement is made and unless the Owner terminates the Contract for convenience,
replacement of damaged property shall be performed by the Contractor after
notification of a Change in the Work in accordance with Article 7.



§
11.4.10 The
Owner
as fiduciary shall have power to adjust and settle a loss with insurers unless
one of the parties in interest
shall object in writing within five days after occurrence of loss to the Owner's
exercise of this power; if such objection is made, the dispute shall be resolved
as provided in Sections 4.5 and 4.6. The Owner as fiduciary shall, in
the
case
of arbitration, make settlement with insurers in accordance with directions
of
the arbitrators. If distribution of insurance proceeds by arbitration is
required, the arbitrators will direct such distribution.



§
11.5 PERFORMANCE BOND AND PAYMENT BOND

§
11.5.1
The
Owner shall have the right to require the Contractor to furnish bonds covering
faithful performance of the
Contract and payment of obligations arising thereunder as stipulated in bidding
requirements or specifically required in the Contract Documents on the date
of
execution of the Contract.

12 UNCOVERING AND CORRECTION OF WORK § 12.1 UNCOVERING OF
WORK

§
12.1.1 If a portion of the Work is covered contrary to the Architect's
request or to requirements specifically expressed
in the Contract Documents, it must, if required in writing by the Architect,
be
uncovered for the Architect's examination and be replaced at the Contractor's
expense without change in the Contract Time.



§
12.1.2
If a
portion of the Work has been covered which the Architect has not specifically
requested to examine prior to its being covered, the Architect may request
to
see such Work and it shall be uncovered by the Contractor. If such Work is
in
accordance with the Contract Documents, costs of uncovering and replacement
shall, by appropriate Change
Order, be at the Owner's expense. If such Work is not in accordance with the
Contract Documents, correction shall be at the Contractor's expense unless
the
condition was caused by the Owner or a separate contractor
in which event the Owner shall be responsible for payment of such
costs.



§
12.2 CORRECTION OF WORK

§
12.2.1 BEFORE OR AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

§
12.2.1.1 The
Contractor shall promptly correct Work rejected by the Architect or failing
to
conform to the

requirements
of the Contract Documents, whether discovered before or after Substantial
Completion and whether or

not
fabricated, installed or completed. Costs of correcting such rejected Work,
including additional testing and

inspections
and compensation for the Architect's services and expenses made necessary
thereby, shall be at the

Contractor's
expense.



§
12.2.2 AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

§
12.2.2.1 In
addition to the Contractor's obligations under Section 3.5, if, within one
year
after the date of Substantial
Completion of the Work or designated portion thereof or after the date for
commencement of warranties established under Section 9.9.1, or by terms of
an
applicable special warranty required by the Contract Documents, any
of
the Work is found to be not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract
Documents, the Contractor shall
correct it promptly after receipt of written notice from the Owner to do so
unless the Owner has previously given
the
Contractor a written acceptance of such condition. The Owner shall give such
notice promptly after discovery of the condition. During the one-year period
for
correction of Work, if the Owner fails to notify the Contractor and give the
Contractor an opportunity to make the correction, the Owner waives the rights
to
require correction by the Contractor and to make a claim for breach of warranty.
If the Contractor fails to correct nonconforming Work within a reasonable time
during that period after receipt of notice from the Owner or Architect,
the Owner may correct it in accordance with Section 2.4.



§
12.2.2.2 The
one-year period for correction of Work shall be extended with respect to
portions of Work first performed
after Substantial Completion by the period of time between Substantial
Completion and the actual performance of the Work.



§
12.2.2.3 The
one-year period for correction of Work shall not be extended by corrective
Work
performed by the Contractor
pursuant to this Section 12.2.



§
12.2.3
The
Contractor shall remove from the site portions of the Work which are not in
accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents and are neither
corrected by the Contractor nor accepted by the Owner.



§
12.2.4 The
Contractor shall bear the cost of correcting destroyed or damaged construction,
whether completed or partially completed, of the Owner or separate contractors
caused by the Contractor's correction or removal of Work which is not in
accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.



§
12.2.5 Nothing
contained in this Section 12.2 shall be construed to establish a period of
limitation with respect to other obligations which the Contractor might have
under the Contract Documents. Establishment of the one-year period for
correction of Work as described in Section 12.2.2 relates only to the specific
obligation of the Contractor to
correct the Work, and has no relationship to the time within which the
obligation to comply with the Contract

Documents
may be sought to be enforced, nor to the time within which proceedings may
be
commenced to establish the
Contractor's liability with respect to the Contractor's obligations other than
specifically to correct the Work.



§
12.3 ACCEPTANCE OF NONCONFORMING WORK

§
12.3.1 If
the
Owner prefers to accept Work which is not in accordance with the requirements
of
the Contract Documents, the Owner may do so instead of requiring its removal
and
correction, in which case the Contract Sum will
be
reduced as appropriate and equitable. Such adjustment shall be effected whether
or not final payment has been
made.

13.5.1
Tests, inspections and approvals of portions of the Work required by the

testing laboratory or entity acceptable to the Owner, or with the appropriate
public authority, and shall bear all related costs of tests, inspections and
approvals. The Contractor shall give the Architect timely notice of when and
where tests and inspections are to be made so that the Architect may be present
for such procedures. The Owner shall bear costs of tests, inspections or
approvals which do not become requirements until after bids are received or
negotiations concluded.



§
13.5.2
If the
Architect, Owner or public authorities having jurisdiction determine that
portions of the Work require additional
testing, inspection or approval not included under Section 13.5.1, the Architect
will, upon written authorization from the Owner, instruct the Contractor to
make
arrangements for such additional testing, inspection or approval by an entity
acceptable to the Owner, and the Contractor shall give timely notice to the
Architect of when
and
where tests and inspections are to be made so that the Architect may be present
for such procedures. Such costs,
except as provided in Section 13.5.3, shall be at the Owner's
expense.

LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT


2.1  Loans-General.

(a)       Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at
any time and from time to time from the Closing Date through the Banking
Day immediately prior to the Maturity Date, each Bank shall, pro rata
according to that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the then applicable Commitment,
make Advances to Borrower under the Commitment in such amounts as Borrower
may request that do not result in the sum of (i) the aggregate principal
amount outstanding under the Notes, plus (ii) the Aggregate Effective
Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit plus (iii) the Swing Line
Outstandings exceeding the then applicable Commitment. Prior to the
Completion Date, Borrower may borrow, but may not repay and reborrow under
the Commitment (provided that this sentence shall not restrict the ability
of Borrower prior to the Completion Date to redesignate an outstanding Loan
as an Alternate Base Loan or as a Eurodollar Rate Loan with the same or a
different Interest Period). Subsequent to the Completion Date, subject to
the limitations set forth herein, Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow
under the Commitment without premium or penalty.

(b)       Subject to the next sentence, each Loan shall be made pursuant to a
Request for Loan which shall specify the requested (i) date of such Loan,
(ii) type of Loan, (iii) amount of such Loan, and (iv) in the case of a
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Interest Period for such Loan. Unless the
Managing Agent has notified, in its sole and absolute discretion, Borrower
to the contrary, a Loan may be requested by telephone by a Responsible
Official of Borrower, in which case Borrower shall confirm such request by
promptly delivering a Request for Loan in person or by telecopier
conforming to the preceding sentence to the Managing Agent. Managing Agent
shall incur no liability whatsoever hereunder in acting upon any telephonic
request for Loan purportedly made by a Responsible Official of Borrower,
and Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Managing Agent from any loss,
cost, expense or liability as a result of so acting.

(c)       Promptly following receipt of a Request for Loan, the Managing Agent
shall notify each Bank by telephone or telecopier (and if by telephone,
promptly confirmed by telecopier) of the date and type of the Loan, the
applicable Interest Period, and that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Loan. Not
later than 11:00 a.m., California time, on the date specified for any Loan
(which must be a Banking

<PAGE>

Day), each Bank shall make its Pro Rata Share of the Loan in immediately
available funds available to the Managing Agent at the Managing Agent's
Office. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions set forth
in Article 9, all Advances shall be credited on that date in immediately
available funds to the Designated Deposit Account.

(d)       Unless the Requisite Banks otherwise consent, each Loan shall be not
less than $5,000,000.

(e)       The Advances made by each Bank shall be evidenced by that Bank's Note.

(f)       A Request for Loan shall be irrevocable upon the Managing Agent's
first notification thereof.

(g)       If no Request for Loan (or telephonic request for Loan referred to in
the second sentence of Section 2.1(b), if applicable) has been made within
the requisite notice periods set forth in Section 2.2 or 2.3 prior to the
end of the Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Loan, then on the last
day of such Interest Period, such Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be
automatically converted into an Alternate Base Rate Loan in the same
amount.

(h)       If a Loan is to be made on the same date that another Loan is due and
payable, Borrower or the Banks, as the case may be, shall make available to
the Managing Agent the net amount of funds giving effect to both such Loans
and the effect for purposes of this Agreement shall be the same as if
separate transfers of funds had been made with respect to each such Loan.

2.2  Alternate Base Rate Loans.  Each request by Borrower for an
Alternate Base Rate Loan shall be made pursuant to a Request for Loan (or
telephonic or other request for loan referred to in the second sentence of
Section 2.1(b), if applicable) received by the Managing Agent, at the Managing
Agent's Office, not later than 9:00 a.m. California time, on the date (which
must be a Banking Day) of the requested Alternate Base Rate Loan.  All Loans
shall constitute Alternate Base Rate Loans unless properly designated as a
Eurodollar Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.3.

<PAGE>

2.3  Eurodollar Rate Loans.

(a)       Each request by Borrower for a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made
pursuant to a Request for Loan (or telephonic or other request for Loan
referred to in the second sentence of Section 2.1(b), if applicable)
received by the Managing Agent, at the Managing Agent's Office, not later
than 9:00 a.m., California time, at least three (3) Eurodollar Banking Days
before the first day of the applicable Eurodollar Period.

(b)       On the date which is two (2) Eurodollar Banking Days before the first
day of the applicable Eurodollar Period, the Managing Agent shall confirm
its determination of the applicable Eurodollar Rate (which determination
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error) and promptly shall
give notice of the same to Borrower and the Banks by telephone or
telecopier (and if by telephone, promptly confirmed by telecopier).

(c)       Unless the Managing Agent and the Requisite Banks otherwise consent,
no more than twelve (12) Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be outstanding at any
one time.

(d)       No Eurodollar Rate Loan may be requested during the continuation of a
Default or Event of Default.

(e)       Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to fund any Eurodollar
Rate Advance in the Designated Eurodollar Market.

2.4  Letters of Credit.

(a)       Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at any time and from time
to time from the Closing Date through the Banking Day immediately prior to
the Maturity Date, the Issuing Bank shall issue such Letters of Credit
under the Commitment as Borrower may request by a Request for Letter of
Credit; provided that (i) giving effect to all such Letters of Credit, the
sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Notes, plus
(B) the Aggregate Effective Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit
plus (C) the Swing Line Outstandings do not exceed the then applicable
Commitment and (ii) the Aggregate Effective Amount under all outstanding
Letters of Credit shall not exceed $20,000,000. Each Letter of Credit shall
be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Issuing Bank. Unless all the
Banks otherwise consent in a writing delivered to the Managing Agent, the
term of any Letter of Credit shall not exceed one (1) year or extend beyond
the Maturity Date.

<PAGE>

(b)       Each Request for Letter of Credit shall be submitted to the Issuing
Bank, with a copy to the Managing Agent, at least five (5) Banking Days
prior to the date upon which the related Letter of Credit is proposed to be
issued. The Managing Agent shall promptly notify the Issuing Bank whether
such Request for Letter of Credit, and the issuance of a Letter of Credit
pursuant thereto, conforms to the requirements of this Agreement. Upon
issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the
Managing Agent, and the Managing Agent shall promptly notify the Banks, of
the amount and terms thereof.

(c)       Upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, each Bank shall be deemed to
have purchased at par a pro rata participation in such Letter of Credit
from the Issuing Bank in an amount equal to that Bank's Pro Rata Share.
Without limiting the scope and nature of each Bank's participation in any
Letter of Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Bank has not been
reimbursed by Borrower for any payment required to be made by the Issuing
Bank under any Letter of Credit, each Bank shall, pro rata according to its
Pro Rata Share, pay the purchase price for such participation to the
Issuing Bank through the Managing Agent promptly upon demand therefor. The
obligation of each Bank to so pay the participation purchase price to the
Issuing Bank shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
by the occurrence of an Event of Default or any other occurrence or event.
Any such payment of the purchase price shall not relieve or otherwise
impair the obligation of Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the
amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
together with interest as hereinafter provided.

(d)       Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank through the Managing Agent
an amount equal to any payment made by the Issuing Bank with respect to
each Letter of Credit within one (1) Banking Day after written demand made
by the Issuing Bank therefor, together with interest on such amount from
the date of any payment made by the Issuing Bank at the rate applicable to
Alternate Base Rate Loans for three Business Days and thereafter at the
Default Rate. The principal amount of any such payment shall be used to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for the payment made by it under the Letter of
Credit and, to the extent that the Banks have not reimbursed the Issuing
Bank pursuant to Section 2.4(c), the interest amount of any such
payment shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank. Each Bank that has
paid the participation purchase price to the Issuing Bank pursuant to
Section 2.4(c) shall thereupon acquire a pro rata participation, to
the extent of such payment, in the claim of the Issuing Bank against
Borrower for reimbursement of principal and interest under this

<PAGE>

Section 2.4(d) and shall share, in accordance with that pro rata
participation, in any principal payment made by Borrower with respect to
such claim and in any interest payment made by Borrower (but only with
respect to periods subsequent to the date such Bank paid the participation
purchase price to the Issuing Bank) with respect to such claim.

(e)       Borrower may, pursuant to a Request for Loan, request that Advances be
made pursuant to Section 2.1(a) to provide funds for the payment required
by Section 2.4(d) and, for this purpose, the conditions precedent set forth
in Article 9 shall not apply. The proceeds of such Advances shall be paid
directly to the Issuing Bank to reimburse it for the payment made by it
under the Letter of Credit.

(f)       If Borrower fails to make the payment required by Section 2.4(d)
within the time period therein set forth, in lieu of the payment of the
participation purchase price to the Issuing Bank under Section 2.4(c) the
Issuing Bank may (but is not required to), without notice to or the consent
of Borrower, instruct the Managing Agent to cause Advances to be made by
the Banks under the Commitment in an aggregate amount equal to the amount
paid by the Issuing Bank with respect to that Letter of Credit and, for
this purpose, the conditions precedent set forth in Article 9 shall not
apply. The proceeds of such Advances shall be paid directly to the Issuing
Bank to reimburse it for the payment made by it under the Letter of Credit.

(g)       The issuance of any supplement, modification, amendment, renewal, or
extension to or of any Letter of Credit shall be treated in all respects
the same as the issuance of a new Letter of Credit, except that the Issuing
Bank's issuance fees shall be payable as set forth in the letter agreement
referred to in Section 3.5.

(h)       The obligation of Borrower to pay to the Issuing Bank the amount of
any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit shall be
absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable, subject only to performance by
the Issuing Bank of its obligations to Borrower under Uniform Commercial
Code Section 5109. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower's obligations
to the Issuing Bank shall not be affected by any of the following
circumstances:

(i)   any lack of validity or
enforceability of the Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other
agreement or instrument relating thereto;

<PAGE>

(ii)   any amendment or waiver of or any
consent to departure from the Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any
other agreement or instrument relating thereto, with the consent of
Borrower;

(iii)   the existence of any claim,
setoff, defense, or other rights which Borrower may have at any time
against the Issuing Bank, the Managing Agent or any Bank, any
beneficiary of the Letter of Credit (or any persons or entities for
whom any such beneficiary may be acting) or any other Person, whether
in connection with the Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other
agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated
transactions;

(iv)   any demand, statement, or any
other document presented under the Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent, invalid, or insufficient in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever
so long as any such document appeared to comply with the terms of the
Letter of Credit;

(v)   payment by the Issuing Bank in
good faith under the Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft
or any accompanying document which does not strictly comply with the
terms of the Letter of Credit;

(vi)   the existence, character,
quality, quantity, condition, packing, value or delivery of any
Property purported to be represented by documents presented in
connection with any Letter of Credit or any difference between any
such Property and the character, quality, quantity, condition, or
value of such Property as described in such documents;

(vii)   the time, place, manner, order
or con tents of shipments or deliveries of Property as described in
documents presented in connection with any Letter of Credit or the
existence, nature and extent of any insurance relative thereto;

(viii)   the solvency or financial
responsibility of any party issuing any documents in connection with a
Letter of Credit;

<PAGE>

(ix)   any failure or delay in notice of
shipments or arrival of any Property;

(x)    any error in the transmission of
any message relating to a Letter of Credit not caused by the Issuing
Bank, or any delay or interruption in any such message;

(xi)   any error, neglect or default of
any correspondent of the Issuing Bank in connection with a Letter of
Credit (but without prejudice to any claim by Borrower against such
correspondent);

(xii)  any consequence arising from
acts of God, war, insurrection, civil unrest, disturbances, labor
disputes, emergency conditions or other causes beyond the control of
the Issuing Bank;

(xiii) so long as the Issuing Bank in
good faith determines that the contract or document appears to comply
with the terms of the Letter of Credit, the form, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of any contract or document referred to in
any document submitted to the Issuing Bank in connection with a Letter
of Credit; and

(xiv)  where the Issuing Bank has acted
in good faith and observed general banking usage, any other
circumstances whatsoever.

(i)       The Issuing Bank shall be entitled to the protection accorded to the
Managing Agent pursuant to Section 11.6, mutatis mutandis.

(j)       The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, as published
in its most current version by the International Chamber of Commerce, shall
be deemed a part of this Section and shall apply to all Letters of Credit
to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Law.

2.5  Voluntary Reduction of Commitment.  Borrower shall have the
right, at any time and from time to time, with out penalty or charge, upon at
least three (3) Banking Days' prior written notice by a Responsible Official of
Borrower to the Managing Agent, voluntarily to reduce, permanently and
irrevocably, in aggregate principal amounts in an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 but not less than $5,000,000, or to terminate, all or a portion of
the then undisbursed portion of the Commitment; provided that the Commitment
may not be so

<PAGE>

reduced below an amount equal to the sum of (a) the Aggregate Effective Amount
of all outstanding Letters of Credit plus (b) the Swing Line Outstandings. The
Managing Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of any reduction or termination
of the Commitment under this Section. Any voluntary reduction of the Commitment
under this Section shall be applied to reduce such Reduction Amount as may be
specified by Borrower or, if no such specification is made, to reduce the
Reduction Amount for the most remote Reduction Date (to the extent of such
reduction) and thereafter to earlier Reduction Dates (to the extent not
previously applied) in the reverse order of their occurrence.

2.6  Contingent Reduction of Commitment.  The Commitment shall be
permanently reduced (a) as of the last day of the fourth full Fiscal Quarter
ending after the Completion Date, by an amount equal to Available Cash Flow for
the fiscal period consisting of that Fiscal Quarter and the three immediately
preceding Fiscal Quarters and (b) as of the last day of any subsequent Fiscal
Quarter if the Leverage Ratio is on that date 2.25 to 1.00 or greater, by an
amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of Available Cash Flow for that Fiscal
Quarter. Any reduction of the Commitment under this Section shall be applied to
reduce the Reduction Amount for the most remote Reduction Date (to the extent of
such reduction) and thereafter to earlier Reduction Dates (to the extent not
previously applied) in the reverse order of their occurrence.

2.7  Automatic Reduction of Commitment.  The Commitment shall be
permanently reduced as of the date upon which a Cash Equity Contribution is
required to be made under the Keep-Well Agreement by an amount equal to the
Banks' Percentage of the portion thereof (if any) attributable to the amount
subtracted from the numerator of the Leverage Ratio pursuant to the calculation
set forth in Section 2(a) of the Keep-Well Agreement.  Any reduction of the
Commitment under this Section shall be applied to reduce the Reduction Amount
for the most remote Reduction Date (to the extent of such reduction) and
thereafter to earlier Reduction Dates (to the extent not previously applied) in
the reverse order of their occurrence.

2.8  Scheduled Reduction of Commitment.  Subject to the last sentences
of Sections 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7, on each Reduction Date, the Commitment shall
automatically be permanently reduced by the applicable Reduction Amount.

2.9  Optional Termination of Commitment.  Following the occurrence of
a Change of Ownership or a Member Change in Control, the Requisite Banks may in
their sole and absolute discretion elect, during the thirty (30) day period
immediately subsequent to the later of (a) such occurrence or (b) the earlier of
(i) receipt of Borrower's written notice to the

<PAGE>

Managing Agent of such occurrence or (ii) if no such notice has been received by
the Managing Agent, the date upon which the Managing Agent has actual knowledge
thereof, to terminate the Commitment, in which case the Commitment shall be
terminated effective on the date which is thirty (30) days subsequent to written
notice from the Managing Agent to Borrower thereof.

2.10  Managing Agent's Right to Assume Funds Available for Advances.
Unless the Managing Agent shall have been notified by any Bank no later than
10:00 a.m. on the Banking Day of the proposed funding by the Managing Agent of
any Loan that such Bank does not intend to make available to the Managing Agent
such Bank's portion of the total amount of such Loan, the Managing Agent may
assume that such Bank has made such amount available to the Managing Agent on
the date of the Loan and the Managing Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. If the Managing
Agent has made funds available to Borrower based on such assumption and such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Managing Agent by such
Bank, the Managing Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount
on demand from such Bank. If such Bank does not pay such corresponding amount
forthwith upon the Managing Agent's demand therefor, the Managing Agent promptly
shall notify Borrower and Borrower shall pay such corresponding amount to the
Managing Agent. The Managing Agent also shall be entitled to recover from such
Bank interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date
such corresponding amount was made available by the Managing Agent to Borrower
to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Managing Agent, at a
rate per annum equal to the daily Federal Funds Rate. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to relieve any Bank from its obligation to fulfill its share of the
Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Managing Agent or Borrower may
have against any Bank as a result of any default by such Bank hereunder.

2.11  Swing Line.  (a)  The Swing Line Bank shall from time to time
from the Completion Date through the Banking Day immediately prior to the
Maturity Date make Swing Line Loans to Borrower in such amounts as Borrower may
request, provided that (i) after giving effect to such Swing Line Loan, the
Swing Line Outstandings do not exceed $10,000,000, (ii) without the consent of
all of the Banks, no Swing Line Loan may be made during the continuation of an
Event of Default and (iii) the Swing Line Bank has not given at least twenty-
four (24) hours prior notice to Borrower that availability under the Swing Line
is suspended or terminated.  Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow under this
Section.  Unless notified to the contrary by the Swing Line Bank, borrowings
under the Swing Line may be made in amounts which are integral multiples of
$100,000 upon telephonic request by a Responsible Official of Borrower made to
the Managing Agent not later than 1:00 p.m., California

<PAGE>

time, on the Banking Day of the requested borrowing (which telephonic request
shall be promptly confirmed in writing by telecopier). Promptly after receipt of
such a request for borrowing, the Managing Agent shall provide telephonic
verification to the Swing Line Bank that, after giving effect to such request,
availability for Loans will exist under Section 2.1(a) (and such verification
shall be promptly confirmed in writing by telecopier). Unless notified to the
contrary by the Swing Line Bank, each repayment of a Swing Line Loan shall be in
an amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000. If Borrower instructs the
Swing Line Bank to debit its demand deposit account at the Swing Line Bank in
the amount of any payment with respect to a Swing Line Loan, or the Swing Line
Bank otherwise receives repayment, after 3:00 p.m., California time, on a
Banking Day, such payment shall be deemed received on the next Banking Day. The
Swing Line Bank shall promptly notify the Managing Agent of the Swing Loan
Outstandings each time there is a change therein and promptly notify the
Managing Agent and the Banks if it suspends or terminates availability under the
Swing Line.

(a)  Swing Line Loans shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate per
annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus (if applicable) an interest rate
equal to the excess of the Applicable Alternate Base Rate Margin over the
Applicable Commitment Fee Rate or minus (if applicable) an interest rate equal
to the excess of the Applicable Commitment Fee Rate over the Applicable
Alternate Base Rate Margin.  Interest shall be payable on such dates, not more
frequent than monthly, as may be specified by the Swing Line Bank and in any
event on the Maturity Date.  The Swing Line Bank shall be responsible for
invoicing Borrower for such interest.  The interest payable on Swing Line Loans
is solely for the account of the Swing Line Bank (subject to clause (d) below).

(b)  The Swing Line Loans shall be payable within five (5) Banking
Days after demand made by the Swing Line Bank and in any event on the Maturity
Date.

(c)  Upon the making of a Swing Line Loan in accordance with Section

2.11(a), each Bank shall be deemed to have purchased from the Swing Line Bank a
participation therein in an amount equal to that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the
Commitment times the amount of the Swing Line Loan.  Upon demand made by the
Swing Line Bank, each Bank shall, according to its Pro Rata Share of the
Commitment, promptly provide to the Swing Line Bank its purchase price therefor
in an amount equal to its participation therein.  The obligation of each Bank to
so provide its purchase price to the Swing Line Bank shall be absolute and
unconditional (except only demand made by the Swing Line Bank) and shall not be
affected by the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default; provided that no
Bank shall be obligated to purchase its Pro Rata Share of

<PAGE>

(i)  Swing Line Loans to the extent that Swing Line Outstandings are in excess
of $10,000,000 or to the extent that the sum of the Indebtedness evidenced by
the Notes plus the Aggregate Effective Amount of all outstanding Letters
of Credit plus the Swing Line Outstandings exceeds the Commitment and (ii)
any Swing Line Loan made (absent the consent of all of the Banks) during the
continuation of an Event of Default. Each Bank that has provided to the Swing
Line Bank the purchase price due for its participation in Swing Line Loans shall
thereupon acquire a pro rata participation, to the extent of such payment, in
the claim of the Swing Line Bank against Borrower for principal and interest and
shall share, in accordance with that pro rata participation, in any principal
payment made by Borrower with respect to such claim and in any interest payment
made by Borrower (but only with respect to periods subsequent to the date such
Bank paid the Swing Line Bank its purchase price) with respect to such claim.

(d)  In the event that the Swing Line Outstandings are outstanding ten
(10) consecutive Banking Days, then on the next Banking Day (unless Borrower has
made other arrangements acceptable to the Swing Line Bank to pay the Swing Line
Outstandings in full), Borrower shall request a Loan pursuant to Section 2.1(a)
sufficient to pay the Swing Line Outstandings in full.  In addition, upon any
demand for payment of the Swing Line Outstandings by the Swing Line Bank (unless
Borrower has made other arrangements acceptable to the Swing Line Bank to reduce
the Swing Line Outstandings to $0), Borrower shall request a Loan pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) sufficient to repay all Swing Line Outstandings (and, for this
purpose, Section 2.1(d) shall not apply).   In each case, the Managing Agent
shall automatically provide the responsive Advances made by each Bank to the
Swing Line Bank (which the Swing Line Bank shall then apply to the Swing Line
Outstandings).  In the event that Borrower fails to request a Loan within the
time specified by Section 2.2 on any such date, the Managing Agent may, but is
not required to, without notice to or the consent of Borrower, cause Advances to
be made by the Banks under the Commitment in amounts which are sufficient to
reduce the Swing Line Outstandings as required above.  The conditions precedent
set forth in Article 9 shall not apply to Advances to be made by the Banks
pursuant to the three preceding sentences but the Banks shall not be obligated
to make such Advances to the extent that the conditions set forth in Section

2.11(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) were not satisfied as to any Swing Line Loan which is
part of such Swing Line Outstandings.  The proceeds of such Advances shall be
paid directly to the Swing Line Bank for application to the Swing Line
Outstandings.

2.12  Collateral and Guaranty.  The Obligations shall be secured by
the Collateral pursuant to the Collateral Documents, be from time to time
guaranteed by the Subsidiaries of Borrower (if any) pursuant to the Subsidiary
Guaranty and

<PAGE>

enjoy the benefits of the Completion Guaranty and Keep-Well Agreement.

2.13  Senior Indebtedness.  The Obligations shall be "Senior
Indebtedness" with respect to all Subordinated Obligations and all payments with
respect thereto shall be subject to Section 6.1.

<PAGE>

PAYMENTS AND FEES


3.1  Principal and Interest.

(a)       Interest shall be payable on the outstanding daily unpaid principal
amount of each Advance from the date thereof until payment in full is made
and shall accrue and be payable at the rates set forth or provided for

after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding
under any Debtor Relief Law, with interest on overdue interest at the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

(b)       Interest accrued on each Alternate Base Rate Loan on each Quarterly
Payment Date, shall be due and payable on that day. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 3.9, the unpaid principal amount of any
Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate per
annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Alternate Base
Rate Margin. Each change in the interest rate under this Section 3.1(b)
due to a change in the Alternate Base Rate shall take effect simultaneously
with the corresponding change in the Alternate Base Rate.

(c)       Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Rate Loan which is for a term of
three months or less shall be due and payable on the last day of the
related Eurodollar Period. Interest accrued on each other Eurodollar Rate
Loan shall be due and payable on the date which is three months after the
date such Eurodollar Rate Loan was made (and, in the event that all of the
Banks have approved a Eurodollar Period of longer than six months, every
three months thereafter through the last day of the Eurodollar Period) and
on the last day of the related Eurodollar Period. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 3.9, the unpaid principal amount of any Eurodollar
Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for that Eurodollar Rate Loan plus the Applicable Eurodollar Rate
Margin.

(d)       If not sooner paid, the principal Indebted ness evidenced by the Notes
shall be payable as follows:

(i)  the amount, if any, by which the sum of
(A) the principal outstanding Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes,
plus (B) the Aggregate Effective Amount of all outstanding Letters of
Credit plus (C) the Swing Line Outstandings at any time exceeds the
then applicable Commitment, shall be payable immediately; and

<PAGE>

(ii)  the principal Indebtedness evidenced by
the Notes shall in any event be payable on the Maturity Date.

(e)       The Notes may, at any time and from time to time, voluntarily be paid
or prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty, except that with
respect to any voluntary prepayment under this Section (i) any partial
prepayment shall be not less than $5,000,000, (ii) the Managing Agent shall
have received written notice of any prepayment by 9:00 a.m. California time
on the date of prepayment (which must be a Banking Day) in the case of an
Alternate Base Rate Loan, and, in the case of a Euro dollar Rate Loan,
three (3) Banking Days before the date of prepayment, which notice shall
identify the date and amount of the prepayment and the Loan(s) being
prepaid, (iii) each prepayment of principal on any Eurodollar Rate Loan
shall be accompanied by payment of interest accrued to the date of payment
on the amount of principal paid and (iv) any payment or prepayment of all
or any part of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of
the applicable Interest Period shall be subject to Section 3.8(e).
Promptly following receipt of a notice of prepayment under clause (ii)
above, the Managing Agent shall notify each Bank by telephone or telecopier
(and if by telephone, promptly confirmed by telecopier) of the date and
amount thereof.

3.2  Arrangement Fee.  On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to the
Arranger an arrangement fee in the amount heretofore agreed upon by letter
agreement between Borrower and the Arranger.  Such arrangement fee is for the
services of the Arranger in arranging the credit facilities under this Agreement
and is fully earned when paid.  The arrangement fee paid to the Arranger is
solely for its own account and is nonrefundable.

3.3  Upfront Fees.  On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to the
Managing Agent, for the accounts of the Managing Agent and the Co-Agent, upfront
fees in the amounts heretofore agreed upon by letter agreement among Borrower,
the Managing Agent and the Arranger.  On the Closing Date, Borrower shall
further pay to the Managing Agent, for the respective accounts of the Banks

(other than the Managing Agent and Co-Agent) pro rata according to their Pro
Rata Share of the Commitment, an upfront fee in an amount equal to .75% (75
basis points) of the amount of the Pro Rata Share of the Commitment of each such
Bank. Such upfront fees are for the credit facilities committed by each Bank
under this Agreement and are fully earned when paid. The upfront fees paid to
each Bank are solely for its own account and are nonrefundable.

<PAGE>

3.4  Commitment Fees.  From the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to
the Managing Agent, for the ratable accounts of the Banks pro rata according to
their Pro Rata Share of the Commitment, a commitment fee equal to the Applicable
Commitment Fee Rate per annum times the average daily amount by which the
Commitment exceeds the sum of (a) the aggregate principal amount outstanding
under the Notes (but not the Swing Line Outstandings) plus (b) the Aggregate
Effective Amount under all outstanding Standby Letters of Credit.  The
commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment
Date and on the Maturity Date.

3.5  Letter of Credit Fees.  With respect to each Letter of Credit,
Borrower shall pay the following fees:

(a)       concurrently with the issuance of each Standby Letter of Credit,
a letter of credit issuance fee to the Issuing Bank for the sole
account of the Issuing Bank, in an amount set forth in a letter
agreement between Borrower and the Issuing Bank;

(b)       concurrently with the issuance of each Standby Letter of Credit,
to the Managing Agent for the ratable account of the Banks in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share of the Commitment, a standby
letter of credit fee in an amount equal to the Applicable Standby
Letter of Credit Fee as of the date of such issuance times the face
amount of such Standby Letter of Credit through the termination or
expiration of such Standby Letter of Credit, which the Managing Agent
shall promptly pay to the Banks; and

(c)       concurrently with each issuance, negotiation, drawing or
amendment of each Commercial Letter of Credit, to the Issuing Bank for
the sole account of the Issuing Bank, issuance, negotiation, drawing
and amendment fees in the amounts set forth from time to time as the
Issuing Bank's published scheduled fees for such services.

Each of the fees payable with respect to Letters of Credit under this Section is
earned when due and is nonrefundable.

3.6  Agency Fees.  Borrower shall pay to the Managing Agent an agency
fee in such amounts and at such times as heretofore agreed upon by letter
agreement between Borrower and the Managing Agent.  The agency fee is for the
services to be performed by the Managing Agent in acting as Managing Agent and
is fully earned on the date paid. The agency fee paid to the Managing Agent is
solely for its own account and is nonrefundable.

<PAGE>

3.7  Increased Commitment Costs.  If any Bank shall determine in good
faith that the introduction after the Closing Date of any applicable law, rule,
regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any central bank or
other Governmental Agency charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by such Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending Office) or any
corporation controlling the Bank, with any request, guideline or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such
central bank or other authority, affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be main tained by such Bank or any corporation
controlling such Bank and (taking into consideration such Bank's or such
corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's desired
return on capital) determines in good faith that the amount of such capital is
increased, or the rate of return on capital is reduced, as a consequence of its
obligations under this Agreement, then, within ten (10) Banking Days after
demand of such Bank, Borrower shall pay to such Bank, from time to time as
specified in good faith by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Bank in light of such circumstances, to the extent reasonably
allocable to such obligations under this Agreement, provided that Borrower shall
not be obligated to pay any such amount which arose prior to the date which is
ninety (90) days preceding the date of such demand or is attributable to periods
prior to the date which is ninety (90) days preceding the date of such demand.
Any request for compensation by a Bank under this Section shall set forth the
basis upon which it has been determined that such an amount is due from
Borrower, a calculation of the amount due, and a certification that the
corresponding costs or diminished rate of return on capital have been incurred
or sustained by the Bank.  If Borrower becomes obligated to pay a material
amount under this Section to any Bank, that Bank will be subject to removal in
accordance with Section 12.27; provided that Borrower shall have paid such
amount to that Bank and that Borrower, within the thirty (30) day period
following the date of such payment, shall have notified that Bank in writing of
its intent to so remove the Bank.  Each Bank's determination of such amounts
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

<PAGE>

3.8  Eurodollar Costs and Related Matters.

(a)       In the event that any Governmental Agency imposes on any Bank any
reserve or comparable requirement (including any emergency, supplemental or
other reserve) with respect to the Eurodollar Obligations of that Bank,
Borrower shall pay that Bank within five (5) Banking Days after demand all
amounts necessary to compensate such Bank (determined as though such Bank's
Eurodollar Lending Office had funded 100% of its Eurodollar Rate Advance in
the Designated Eurodollar Market) in respect of the imposition of such
reserve requirements. The Bank's determination of such amount shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(b)       If, after the date hereof, the existence or occurrence of any Special
Eurodollar Circumstance:

(1)       shall subject any Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to any
tax, duty or other charge or cost with respect to any Eurodollar Rate
Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans or its
obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances, or shall change the basis
of taxation of payments to any Bank attributable to the principal of
or interest on any Eurodollar Rate Advance or any other amounts due
under this Agreement in respect of any Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of
its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances, excluding (i) taxes imposed on or measured
in whole or in part by its overall net income by (A) any jurisdiction
(or political subdivision thereof) in which it is organized or
maintains its principal office or Eurodollar Lending Office or (B) any
jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is "doing
business," and (ii) any withholding taxes or other taxes based on
gross income imposed by the United States of America for any period
with respect to which it has failed to provide Borrower with the
appropriate form or forms required by Section 12.21, to the extent
such forms are then available under applicable Laws;

(2)       shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve not
applicable or deemed applicable on the date hereof (including any
reserve imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, special deposit, capital or similar requirements against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by,
any Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office); or

<PAGE>

(3)       shall impose on any Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office or the
Designated Eurodollar Market any other condition affecting any
Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate
Loans, its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or this
Agreement, or shall otherwise affect any of the same;

and the result of any of the foregoing, as determined in good faith by such
Bank, increases the cost to such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office of
making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Advance or in respect of any
Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans
or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or reduces the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending
Office with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes
evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances (assuming such Bank's Eurodollar Lending Office had funded 100% of
its Eurodollar Rate Advance in the Designated Eurodollar Market), then,
within five (5) Banking Days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the
Managing Agent), Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction
(determined as though such Bank's Eurodollar Lending Office had funded 100%
of its Eurodollar Rate Advance in the Designated Eurodollar Market). A
statement of any Bank claiming compensation under this subsection and
setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount or amounts to be
paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

(c)       If, after the date hereof, the existence or occurrence of any Special
Eurodollar Circumstance shall, in the good faith opinion of any Bank, make
it unlawful or impossible for such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to
make, maintain or fund its portion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan, or
materially restrict the authority of such Bank to purchase or sell, or to
take deposits of, Dollars in the Designated Eurodollar Market, or to
determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, and such
Bank shall so notify the Managing Agent, then such Bank's obligation to
make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended for the duration of such
illegality or impossibility and the Managing Agent forthwith shall give
notice thereof to the other Banks and Borrower. Upon receipt of such
notice, the outstanding principal amount of such Bank's Eurodollar Rate
Advances, together with accrued interest thereon, automatically shall be
converted to Alternate Base Rate Advances on either (1) the last day of the
Eurodollar Period(s) applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Advances if such
Bank may lawfully continue to

<PAGE>

maintain and fund such Eurodollar Rate Advances to such day(s) or (2)
immediately if such Bank may not lawfully continue to fund and maintain
such Eurodollar Rate Advances to such day(s), provided that in such event
the conversion shall not be to payment of a prepayment fee under clause (e)
of this Section. Each Bank agrees to endeavor promptly to notify Borrower
of any event of which it has actual knowledge, occurring after the Closing
Date, which will cause that Bank to notify the Managing Agent under this
Section, and agrees to designate a different Eurodollar Lending Office if
such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the
good faith judgment of such Bank, otherwise be materially disadvantageous
to such Bank. In the event that any Bank is unable, for the reasons set
forth above, to make, maintain or fund its portion of any Eurodollar Rate
Loan, such Bank shall fund such amount as an Alternate Base Rate Advance
for the same period of time, and such amount shall be treated in all
respects as an Alternate Base Rate Advance. Any Bank whose obligation to
make Eurodollar Rate Advances has been suspended under this Section shall
promptly notify the Managing Agent and Borrower of the cessation of the
Special Eurodollar Circumstance which gave rise to such suspension.

(d)       If, with respect to any proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan:

(1)       the Managing Agent reasonably determines that, by reason of
circumstances affecting the Designated Eurodollar Market generally
that are beyond the reasonable control of the Banks, deposits in
Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to any Bank
in the Designated Eurodollar Market for the applicable Eurodollar
Period; or

(2)       the Requisite Banks advise the Managing Agent that the Eurodollar
Rate as determined by the Managing Agent (i) does not represent the
effective pricing to such Banks for deposits in Dollars in the
Designated Eurodollar Market in the relevant amount for the applicable
Eurodollar Period, or (ii) will not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Banks of making the applicable Eurodollar Rate Advances;

then the Managing Agent forthwith shall give notice thereof to Borrower and
the Banks, whereupon until the Managing Agent notifies Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
obligation of the Banks to make any future Eurodollar Rate Advances shall
be suspended unless (but only if clause (2) above is the basis for such
suspension) Borrower notifies

<PAGE>

the Managing Agent in writing that it elects to pay the Enhanced Applicable
Eurodollar Rate Margin with respect to all Eurodollar Rate Loans made
during such period. The Enhanced Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin shall be
the sum of (i) the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin plus (ii) such
interest rate margin as the Requisite Banks specify is necessary to adjust
the Eurodollar Rate to a rate which represents the effective pricing to
such Banks for deposits of Dollars in the Designated Eurodollar Market in
the relevant amount for the applicable Eurodollar Period and which
adequately and fairly reflects the cost to such Banks of making the
applicable Eurodollar Rate Advances.

(e)       Upon payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Advance (other than
as the result of a conversion required under clause (c) of this Section) on
a day other than the last day in the applicable Eurodollar Period (whether
voluntarily, involuntarily, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise), or
upon the failure of Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of a Bank
to make an Advance) to borrow on the date or in the amount specified for a
Eurodollar Rate Loan in any Request for Loan, or upon the failure of
Borrower to prepay a Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date specified in a notice
of prepayment delivered to the Managing Agent pursuant to Section 3.1(e),
Borrower shall pay to the appropriate Bank within ten (10) Banking Days
after demand a prepayment fee, failure to borrow fee or failure to prepay
fee, as the case may be (determined as though 100% of the Eurodollar Rate
Advance had been funded in the Designated Eurodollar Market), equal to the
sum of:

(1)       the principal amount of the Eurodollar Rate Advance prepaid
or not borrowed or prepaid, as the case may be, times [the number of
days from and including the date of prepayment or failure to borrow or
prepay, as applicable, to but excluding the last day in the applicable
Eurodollar Period], divided by 360, times the applicable Interest
Differential (provided that the product of the foregoing formula must
be a positive number); plus

(2)       all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Bank reasonably
attributable to such payment, prepayment or failure to borrow.

Each Bank's determination of the amount of any prepayment fee, failure to
borrow fee or failure to prepay fee payable under this Section shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

<PAGE>

(f)       Each Bank agrees to endeavor promptly to notify Borrower of any event
of which it has actual knowledge, occurring after the Closing Date, which
will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant to clause (a) or clause (b)
of this Section, and agrees to designate a different Eurodollar Lending
Office if such designation will avoid the need for or reduce the amount of
such compensation and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Bank,
otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Bank. Any request for
compensation by a Bank under this Section shall set forth the basis upon
which it has been determined that such an amount is due from Borrower, a
calculation of the amount due, and a certification that the corresponding
costs have been incurred by the Bank.

(g)       If any Bank claims compensation or is excused from making or
continuing Eurodollar Rate Loans under this Section:

(i)   Borrower may at any time, upon at least
four (4) Eurodollar Banking Days' prior notice to the Managing Agent
and such Bank and upon payment in full of the amounts provided for in
this Section through the date of such payment plus any prepayment fee
(subject to clause (c) of this Section) required by clause (e) of this
Section, pay in full the affected Eurodollar Rate Advances of such
Bank or request that such Eurodollar Rate Advances be converted to
Alternate Base Rate Advances; and

(ii)  In the case where Borrower becomes
obligated to pay a material amount under this Section 3.8 to any Bank,
that Bank will be subject to removal in accordance with Section
12.27; provided that Borrower shall have paid such amount
to that Bank and that Borrower, within the thirty (30) day period
following the date of such payment, shall have notified that Bank in
writing of its intent to so remove the Bank.

3.9  Late Payments.  If any installment of principal or interest or
any fee or cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document to the Managing
Agent or any Bank is not paid when due, it shall thereafter bear interest at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the sum of the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Alternate Base Rate Margin plus 2%, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  Accrued and unpaid interest on
past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be compounded
monthly, on the last day of each calendar month, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Laws.

<PAGE>

3.10  Computation of Interest and Fees.  Computation of interest on
Alternate Base Rate Loans and all fees under this Agreement shall be calculated
on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual
number of days elapsed; computation of interest on Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days
elapsed. Borrower acknowledge that such latter calculation method will result in
a higher yield to the Banks than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days.
Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made;
interest shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on
which the Loan or such portion is paid. Any Loan that is repaid on the same day
on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, interest in excess of the maximum amount
permitted by applicable Laws shall not accrue or be payable hereunder or under
the Notes, and any amount paid as interest hereunder or under the Notes which
would otherwise be in excess of such maximum permitted amount shall instead be
treated as a payment of principal.

3.11  Non-Banking Days.  If any payment to be made by Borrower or any
other Party under any Loan Document shall come due on a day other than a Banking
Day, payment shall instead be considered due on the next succeeding Banking Day
and the extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest and fees.

3.12  Manner and Treatment of Payments.

(a)       Each payment hereunder (except payments pursuant to Sections
2.10, 3.7, 3.8, 12.3, 12.11 and 12.22) or on the Notes or under any other
Loan Document shall be made to the Managing Agent, at the Managing Agent's
Office, for the account of each of the Banks or the Managing Agent, as the
case may be, in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m.
(other than payments with respect to Swing Line Loans, which must be
received by 3:00 p.m.), California time, on the day of payment (which must
be a Banking Day).  All payments received after such time, on any Banking
Day, shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Banking Day.  The
amount of all payments received by the Managing Agent for the account of
each Bank shall be immediately paid by the Managing Agent to the applicable
Bank in immediately available funds and, if such payment was received by
the Managing Agent by 11:00 a.m., California time, on a Banking Day and not
so made available to the account of a Bank on that Banking Day, the
Managing Agent shall reimburse that Bank for the cost to such Bank of
funding the amount of such payment at the Federal Funds Rate.  All payments
shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America.

<PAGE>

(b)       Each payment or prepayment on account of any Loan shall be applied pro
rata according to the outstanding Advances made by each Bank comprising
such Loan.

(c)       Each Bank shall use its best efforts to keep a record (which may be in
tangible or electronic or other intangible form) of Advances made by it and
payments received by it with respect to each of its Notes and, subject to
Section 11.6(g), such record shall, as against Borrower, be presumptive
evidence of the amounts owing. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the
failure by any Bank to keep such a record shall not affect Borrower's
obligation to pay the Obligations.

(d)       Each payment of any amount payable by Borrower or any other Party
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free and
clear of, and without reduction by reason of, any taxes, assessments or
other charges imposed by any Governmental Agency, central bank or
comparable authority, excluding (i) taxes imposed on or measured in whole
or in part by overall net income, gross income or gross receipts and
franchise taxes imposed on any Bank by (A) any jurisdiction (or political
subdivision thereof) in which it is organized or maintains its principal
office or Eurodollar Lending Office or (B) any jurisdiction (or political
subdivision thereof) in which it is "doing business", (ii) any withholding
taxes or other taxes based on gross income imposed by the United States of
America that are not attributable to any change in any Law or the
interpretation or administration of any Law by any Governmental Agency and
(iii) any withholding tax or other taxes based on gross income imposed by
the United States of America for any period with respect to which it has
failed to provide Borrower with the appropriate form or forms required by
Section 12.21, to the extent such forms are then available under applicable
Laws (all such non-excluded taxes, assessments or other charges being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). To the extent that Borrower is
obligated by applicable Laws to make any deduction or withholding on
account of Taxes from any amount payable to any Bank under this Agreement,
Borrower shall (i) make such deduction or withholding and pay the same to
the relevant Governmental Agency and (ii) pay such additional amount to
that Bank as is necessary to result in that Bank's receiving a net
after-Tax amount equal to the amount to which that Bank would have been
entitled under this Agreement absent such deduction or withholding. If and
when receipt of such payment results in an excess payment or credit to that
Bank on account of such Taxes, that Bank shall promptly refund such excess
to Borrower. If Borrower becomes obligated to pay a material amount under
this Section to any Bank, that Bank will be subject to removal in

<PAGE>

accordance with Section 12.27; provided that Borrower shall have paid such
amount to that Bank and that Borrower, within the thirty (30) day period
following the date of such payment, shall have notified that Bank in
writing of its intent to so remove the Bank.

3.13  Funding Sources.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
obligate any Bank to obtain the funds for any Loan or Advance in any particular
place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Bank that it has
obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan or Advance in any particular
place or manner.

3.14  Failure to Charge Not Subsequent Waiver.  Any decision by the
Managing Agent or any Bank not to require payment of any interest (including
interest at the Default Rate), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan
Document, or to calculate any amount payable by a particular method, on any
occasion shall in no way limit or be deemed a waiver of the Managing Agent's or
such Bank's right to require full payment of any interest (including interest at
the Default Rate), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document, or
to calculate an amount payable by another method that is not inconsistent with
this Agreement, on any other or subsequent occasion.

3.15  Managing Agent's Right to Assume Payments Will be Made by
Borrower.  Unless the Managing Agent shall have been notified by Borrower prior
to the date on which any payment to be made by Borrower hereunder is due that
Borrower does not intend to remit such payment, the Managing Agent may, in its
discretion, assume that Borrower has remitted such payment when so due and the
Managing Agent may, in its discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to each Bank on such payment date an amount equal to such Bank's share
of such assumed payment.  If Borrower has not in fact remitted such payment to
the Managing Agent, each Bank shall forthwith on demand repay to the Managing
Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available to such Bank, together
with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such
amount was made available by the Managing Agent to such Bank to the date such
amount is repaid to the Managing Agent at the Federal Funds Rate.

3.16  Fee Determination Detail.  The Managing Agent, and any Bank,
shall provide reasonable detail to Borrower regarding the manner in which the
amount of any payment to the Managing Agent and the Banks, or that Bank, under

Article 3 has been determined, concurrently with demand for such payment.

3.17  Survivability.  All of Borrower's obligations under Sections 3.7
and 3.8 shall survive for ninety (90) days following the date on which the
Commitment is terminated, all

<PAGE>

Loans hereunder are fully paid and all Letters of Credit have expired.

<PAGE>

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


Borrower represents and warrants to the Banks that:

4.1  Existence and Qualification; Power; Compliance With Laws.
Borrower is a limited liability company duly formed, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of Nevada.  Each of the Guarantors and each of the
Members is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of their respective States of formation.  Borrower, each Member
and each Guarantor is duly qualified or registered to transact business and is
in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its Properties makes such qualification or
registration necessary, except where the failure so to qualify or register and
to be in good standing would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.  Borrower
and each Guarantor has all requisite corporate or other organizational power and
authority to conduct its business, to own and lease its Properties and to
execute and deliver each Loan Document to which it is a Party and to perform its
Obligations.  All outstanding interests in the equity capital of Borrower are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and no holder
thereof has any enforceable right of rescission under any applicable state or
federal securities Laws.  Borrower is in compliance with all Requirements of
Laws applicable to its business as at present conducted, has obtained all
authorizations, consents, approvals, orders, licenses and permits from, and has
accomplished all filings, registrations and qualifications with, or obtained
exemptions from any of the foregoing from, any Governmental Agency that are
necessary for the transaction of its business as at present conducted, except
where the failure so to comply, file, register, qualify or obtain exemptions
does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect.  The Banks acknowledge that
Borrower is not required to hold any licenses under applicable Gaming Laws until
the Completion Date and will not apply for such licenses until shortly prior to
the Completion Date.

4.2  Authority; Compliance With Other Agreements and Instruments and
Government Regulations.  The execution, delivery and performance by Borrower,
each Member and each Guarantor of the Loan Documents to which it is a Party have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other organizational action,
and do not and will not:

(a)       Require any consent or approval not hereto fore obtained of any
member, partner, director, stockholder, security holder or creditor of such
Party;

<PAGE>

(b)       Violate or conflict with any provision of such Party's charter,
articles of organization or incorporation, operating agreement or bylaws,
as applicable;

(c)       Result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien or Right
of Others upon or with respect to any Property now owned or leased or
hereafter acquired by such Party;

(d)       Violate any Requirement of Law applicable to such Party, subject to
obtaining the authorizations from, or filings with, the Governmental
Agencies described in Schedule 4.3;

(e)       Result in a breach of or constitute a default under, or cause or
permit the acceleration of any obligation owed under, any indenture or loan
or credit agreement or any other Contractual Obligation to which such Party
is a party or by which such Party or any of its Property is bound or
affected;

and none of Borrower, any Member or any Guarantor is in violation of, or default
under, any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation, or any indenture, loan
or credit agreement described in Section 4.2(e), in any respect that constitutes
a Material Adverse Effect.

4.3  No Governmental Approvals Required.  Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.3 or previously obtained or made, no authorization, consent,
approval, order, license or permit from, or filing, registration or
qualification with, any Governmental Agency is or will be required to authorize
or permit under applicable Laws the execution, delivery and performance by
Borrower and its Subsidiaries or any Member or Guarantor of the Loan Documents
to which it is a Party. All authorizations from, or filings with, any
Governmental Agency described in Schedule 4.3 will be accomplished as of the
Closing Date.

<PAGE>

4.4  Subsidiaries.

(a)       Schedule 4.4 hereto correctly sets forth the names, form of legal
entity, number of shares of capital stock issued and outstanding, number
of shares owned by Borrower or a Subsidiary of Borrower (specifying such
owner) and jurisdictions of organization of all Subsidiaries of Borrower.
Except as described in Schedule 4.4 or Schedule 6.17, Borrower does not own
any capital stock, equity interest or debt security which is convertible,
or exchangeable, for capital stock or equity interests in any Person.
Unless otherwise indicated in Schedule 4.4, all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock, or all of the units of equity interest, as the case may
be, of each Subsidiary are owned of record and beneficially by Borrower,

guaranty of present or future Indebtedness of each Guarantor of $15,000,000
or more, if as a result of such failure or sufferance any holder or holders

declare such Indebtedness due before the date on which it otherwise would
become due or the right to require Guarantors to redeem or purchase, or
offer to redeem or purchase, all or any portion of such Indebtedness

or otherwise:

(a)  Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of
Default other than an Event of Default described in Section 10.1(m):

(1)       the Commitment to make Advances, the obligation of the
Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit and all other obligations of
the Managing Agent or the Banks and all rights of Borrower and any
other Parties under the Loan Documents shall be suspended without
notice to or demand upon Borrower, which are expressly waived by
Borrower, except that all of the Banks or the Requisite Banks (as the
case may be, in accordance with Section 12.2) may waive an Event of
Default or, without waiving, determine, upon terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Banks or Requisite Banks, as the case may be, to
reinstate the Commitment and such other obligations and rights and
make further Advances, and cause the Issuing Bank to issue further
Letters of Credit which waiver or determination shall apply equally
to, and shall be binding upon, all the Banks;

<PAGE>

(2)       the Issuing Bank may, with the approval of the Managing
Agent on behalf of the Requisite Banks, demand immediate payment by
Borrower of an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all outstanding
Letters of Credit to be held by the Issuing Bank in an interest-
bearing cash collateral account as collateral hereunder; and

(3)       the Requisite Banks may request the Managing Agent to, and
the Managing Agent thereupon shall, terminate the Commitment and/or
declare all or any part of the unpaid principal of all Notes, all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable
under the Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon
the same shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without
protest, presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of
any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower.

(b)       Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of
Default described in Section 10.1(m):

(1)       the Commitment to make Advances, the obligation of the
Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit and all other obligations of
the Managing Agent or the Banks and all rights of Borrower and any
other Parties under the Loan Documents shall terminate without notice
to or demand upon Borrower, which are expressly waived by Borrower,
except that all of the Banks may waive the Event of Default or,
without waiving, determine, upon terms and conditions satisfactory to
all the Banks, to reinstate the Commitment and such other obligations
and rights and make further Advances and to cause the Issuing Bank to
issue further Letters of Credit, which determination shall apply
equally to, and shall be binding upon, all the Banks;

(2)       an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all outstanding
Letters of Credit shall be immediately due and payable to the Issuing
Bank without notice to or demand upon Borrower, which are expressly
waived by Borrower, to be held by the Issuing Bank in an interest-
bearing cash collateral account as collateral hereunder; and

(3)       the unpaid principal of all Notes, all interest accrued and
unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents
shall be forthwith due and payable, without protest, presentment,
notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of any kind, all of which
are expressly waived by Borrower.

<PAGE>

(c)       Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of
Default, the Banks and the Managing Agent, or any of them, without notice
to (except as expressly provided for in any Loan Document) or demand upon
Borrower, which are expressly waived by Borrower (except as to notices
expressly provided for in any Loan Document), may proceed (but only with
the consent of the Requisite Banks) to protect, exercise and enforce their
rights and remedies under the Loan Documents against Borrower and any other
Party and such other rights and remedies as are provided by Law or equity.

(d)       In addition to any other rights and remedies, if an Event of
Default occurs prior to the Completion Date, the Managing Agent and the
Banks shall have the right to take possession of the Project, whether in
person or through a designee or receiver, and take such steps as the
Managing Agent and the Banks reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to
complete construction of the Project, including making any changes to the
Construction Plans, Construction Budget or Construction Timetable and/or
terminating or amending any of the Architects Contracts, Engineer
Contracts, Construction Contracts or any other contract or arrangement
related to the Project; provided, however, that the Managing Agent shall be
responsible for any breach of contract resulting from any such change,
termination or amendment.  Any such action shall not be construed as an
assumption of responsibility by the Managing Agent or the Banks to complete
the Project, and such steps may be discontinued at any time.  Any such
action shall not be construed to make the Managing Agent or the Banks a
partner or joint venturer with Borrower.  All amounts expended by the
Managing Agent and the Banks for the completion of the Project shall be
deemed additional Advances and shall be secured by the Collateral
Documents.

(e)       The order and manner in which the Banks' rights and remedies are to be
exercised shall be determined by the Requisite Banks in their sole
discretion, and all payments received by the Managing Agent and the Banks,
or any of them, shall be applied first to the costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements and the reasonably allocated
costs of attorneys employed by the Managing Agent or by any Bank) of the
Managing Agent and of the Banks, and thereafter paid pro rata to the Banks
in the same proportions that the aggregate Obligations owed to each Bank
under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate Obligations owed under the
Loan Documents to all the Banks, without priority or preference among the
Banks. Regardless of how each Bank may treat payments for the purpose of
its own accounting, for the

<PAGE>

purpose of computing Borrower' Obligations here under and under the Notes,
payments shall be applied first, to the costs and expenses of the Managing
Agent and the Banks, as set forth above, second, to the payment of accrued
and unpaid interest due under any Loan Documents to and including the date
of such application (ratably, and without duplication, according to the
accrued and unpaid interest due under each of the Loan Documents), and
third, to the payment of all other amounts (including principal and fees)
then owing to the Managing Agent or the Banks under the Loan Documents.
Amounts due to a Bank under a Secured Swap Agreement shall be considered a
principal amount for purposes of the preceding sentence. No application of
payments will cure any Event of Default, or prevent acceleration, or
continued acceleration, of amounts payable under the Loan Documents, or
prevent the exercise, or continued exercise, of rights or remedies of the
Banks hereunder or thereunder or at Law or in equity.

<PAGE>

THE MANAGING AGENT


11.1  Appointment and Authorization.  Subject to Section 11.8, each
Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Managing Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan
Documents as are delegated to the Managing Agent by the terms thereof or are
reasonably incidental, as determined by the Managing Agent, thereto.  This
appointment and authorization is intended solely for the purpose of facilitating
the servicing of the Loans and does not constitute appointment of the Managing
Agent as trustee for any Bank or as representative of any Bank for any other
purpose and, except as specifically set forth in the Loan Documents to the
contrary, the Managing Agent shall take such action and exercise such powers
only in an administrative and ministerial capacity.

11.2  Managing Agent and Affiliates.  Bank of America National Trust
and Savings Association (and each successor Managing Agent) has the same rights
and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Bank and may exercise the same
as though it were not the Managing Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks"
includes Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in its
individual capacity.  Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association
(and each successor Managing Agent) and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other
business with Borrower, any Subsidiary thereof, or any Affiliate of Borrower or
any Subsidiary thereof, as if it were not the Managing Agent and without any
duty to account therefor to the Banks.  Bank of America National Trust and
Savings Association (and each successor Managing Agent) need not account to any
other Bank for any monies received by it for reimbursement of its costs and
expenses as Managing Agent hereunder, or for any monies received by it in its
capacity as a Bank hereunder.  The Managing Agent shall not be deemed to hold a
fiduciary relationship with any Bank and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Managing Agent.

11.3  Proportionate Interest in any Collateral.  The Managing Agent,
on behalf of all the Banks, shall hold in accordance with the Loan Documents all
items of any collateral or interests therein received or held by the Managing
Agent.  Subject to the Managing Agent's and the Banks' rights to reimbursement
for their costs and expenses hereunder (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements and other professional services and the reasonably allocated costs
of attorneys employed by the Managing Agent or a Bank) and subject to the
application of payments in accordance with Section

<PAGE>

10.2(d), each Bank shall have an interest in the Banks' interest in the
Collateral or interests therein in the same proportions that the aggregate
Obligations owed such Bank under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate
Obligations owed under the Loan Documents to all the Banks, without priority or
preference among the Banks, except that Obligations owed to any Bank under a
Secured Swap Agreement shall be secured on a pari passu basis with all other
Obligations up to an amount equal to the Managing Agent's then customary credit
risk factor for Swap Agreements times the notional amount of Indebtedness
covered by such Secured Swap Agreement and shall be secured on a subordinate
basis as to amounts in excess of such amount.

11.4  Banks' Credit Decisions.  Each Bank agrees that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Managing Agent, any other Bank or
the directors, officers, agents, employees or attorneys of the Managing Agent or
of any other Bank, and instead in reliance upon information supplied to it by or
on behalf of Borrower and upon such other information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own independent credit analysis and decision to enter into
this Agreement.  Each Bank also agrees that it shall, independently and without
reliance upon the Managing Agent, any other Bank or the directors, officers,
agents, employees or attorneys of the Managing Agent or of any other Bank,
continue to make its own independent credit analyses and decisions in acting or
not acting under the Loan Documents.

11.5  Action by Managing Agent.

(a)       Absent actual knowledge of the Managing Agent of the existence of a
Default, the Managing Agent may assume that no Default has occurred and is
continuing, unless the Managing Agent (or the Bank that is then the
Managing Agent) has received notice from Borrower stating the nature of the
Default or has received notice from a Bank stating the nature of the
Default and that such Bank considers the Default to have occurred and to be
continuing.

(b)       The Managing Agent has only those obligations under the Loan Documents
as are expressly set forth therein.

(c)       Except for any obligation expressly set forth in the Loan Documents
and as long as the Managing Agent may assume that no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Managing Agent may, but shall not be
required to, exercise its discretion to act or not act, except that
the Managing Agent shall be required to act or not act upon the
instructions of the Requisite Banks (or of all the Banks, to the extent
required by Section 12.2) and those instructions shall be binding upon the
Managing Agent and all the Banks, provided that the Managing Agent


<PAGE>

shall not be required to act or not act if to do so would be contrary to
any Loan Document or to applicable Law or would result, in the reasonable
judgment of the Managing Agent, in substantial risk of liability to the
Managing Agent.

(d)       If the Managing Agent has received a notice specified in clause
(a), the Managing Agent shall immediately give notice thereof to the Banks
and shall act or not act upon the instructions of the Requisite Banks (or
of all the Banks, to the extent required by Section 12.2), provided that
the Managing Agent shall not be required to act or not act if to do so
would be contrary to any Loan Document or to applicable Law or would
result, in the reasonable judgment of the Managing Agent, in substantial
risk of liability to the Managing Agent, and except that if the Requisite
Banks (or all the Banks, if required under Section 12.2) fail, for five (5)
Banking Days after the receipt of notice from the Managing Agent, to
instruct the Managing Agent, then the Managing Agent, in its sole
discretion, may act or not act as it deems advisable for the protection of
the interests of the Banks.

(e)       The Managing Agent shall have no liability to any Bank for acting, or
not acting, as instructed by the Requisite Banks (or all the Banks, if
required under Section 12.2), notwithstanding any other provision hereof.

11.6  Liability of Managing Agent.  Neither the Managing Agent nor any
of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or not taken by them under or in connection with the Loan Documents,
except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation
on the foregoing, the Managing Agent and its directors, officers, agents and
employees:

(a)       May treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the
Managing Agent receives notice of the assignment or transfer thereof, in
form satisfactory to the Managing Agent, signed by the payee, and may treat
each Bank as the owner of that Bank's interest in the Obligations for all
purposes of this Agreement until the Managing Agent receives notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof, in form satisfactory to the Managing Agent,
signed by that Bank;

(b)       May consult with legal counsel (including in-house legal
counsel), accountants (including in-house accountants) and other
professionals or experts selected by it, or with legal counsel, accountants
or other professionals or experts for Borrower and/or their Subsidiaries or
the Banks, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in good faith in accordance with any

<PAGE>

advice of such legal counsel, accountants or other professionals or
experts;

(c)       Shall not be responsible to any Bank for any statement, warranty
or representation made in any of the Loan Documents or in any notice,
certificate, report, request or other statement (written or oral) given or
made in connection with any of the Loan Documents;

(d)       Except to the extent expressly set forth in the Loan Documents,
shall have no duty to ask or inquire as to the performance or observance by
Borrower or its Subsidiaries of any of the terms, conditions or covenants
of any of the Loan Documents or to inspect any Collateral or the Property,
books or records of Borrower or their Subsidiaries;

(e)       Will not be responsible to any Bank for the due execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, effectiveness, sufficiency or value
of any Loan Document, any other instrument or writing furnished pursuant
thereto or in connection therewith, or any Collateral;

(f)       Will not incur any liability by acting or not acting in reliance
upon any Loan Document, notice, consent, certificate, statement, request or
other instrument or writing believed in good faith by it to be genuine and
signed or sent by the proper party or parties; and

(g)       Will not incur any liability for any arithmetical error in computing
any amount paid or payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof or paid or payable to or received or receivable from any Bank under
any Loan Document, including, principal, interest, commitment fees,
Advances and other amounts; provided that, promptly upon discovery of such
an error in computation, the Managing Agent, the Banks and (to the extent
applicable) Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall make such
adjustments as are necessary to correct such error and to restore the
parties to the position that they would have occupied had the error not
occurred.

11.7  Indemnification.  Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance with
its Pro Rata Share of the Commitment (if the Commitment is then in effect) or in
accordance with its proportion of the aggregate Indebtedness then evidenced by
the Notes (if the Commitment has then been terminated), indemnify and hold the
Managing Agent and its directors, officers, agents, employees and attorneys
harmless against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind

<PAGE>

or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and
disbursements and allocated costs of attorneys employed by the Managing Agent)
that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it or them in such
capacity in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents (other than
losses incurred by reason of the failure of Borrower to pay the Indebtedness
represented by the Notes) or any action taken or not taken by it as Managing
Agent thereunder, except such as result from its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation on the foregoing, each Bank shall reimburse the
Managing Agent upon demand for that Bank's Pro Rata Share of any out-of-pocket
cost or expense incurred by the Managing Agent in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, amendment, waiver,
restructuring, reorganization (including a bankruptcy reorganization),
enforcement or attempted enforcement of the Loan Documents, to the extent that
Borrower or any other Party is required by Section 12.3 to pay that cost or
expense but fails to do so upon demand. Nothing in this Section 11.7 shall
entitle the Managing Agent to recover any amount from the Banks if and to the
extent that such amount has theretofore been recovered from Borrower or any
other Party. To the extent that the Managing Agent is later reimbursed such cost
or expense by Borrower or any other Party, it shall return the amounts paid to
it by the Banks in respect of such cost or expense.

11.8  Successor Managing Agent.  The Managing Agent may, and at the
request of the Requisite Banks shall, resign as Managing Agent upon thirty (30)
days' notice to the Banks and Borrower.  If the Managing Agent shall resign as
Managing Agent under this Agreement, the Requisite Banks shall appoint from
among the Banks a successor Managing Agent for the Banks, which successor
Managing Agent shall be approved by Borrower (and such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no successor Managing Agent is appointed
prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Managing Agent, the
Managing Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the Borrower, a
successor Managing Agent from among the Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as successor Managing Agent hereunder, such successor Managing Agent
shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Managing
Agent and the term "Managing Agent" shall mean such successor Managing Agent and
the retiring Managing Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Managing Agent
shall be terminated.  After any retiring Managing Agent's resignation hereunder
as Managing Agent, the provisions of this Article 11, and Sections 12.3, 12.11
and 12.22, shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Managing Agent under this Agreement.  If (a) the
Managing Agent has not been paid its agency fees under Section 3.6 or has not
been reimbursed for any expense reimbursable to it under Section 12.3, in either
case for a period of at least one (1) year and (b) no successor Managing Agent
has accepted appointment as Managing.

<PAGE>

Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Managing
Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Managing Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Banks shall perform all of the
duties of the Managing Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Requisite
Banks appoint a successor Managing Agent as provided for above.

11.9  Foreclosure on Collateral.  In the event of foreclosure or
enforcement of the Lien created by any of the Collateral Documents, title to the
Collateral covered thereby shall be taken and held by the Managing Agent (or an
Affiliate or designee thereof) pro rata for the benefit of the Banks in
accordance with the Obligations outstanding to each of them and shall be
administered in accordance with the standard form of collateral holding
participation agreement used by the Managing Agent in comparable syndicated
credit facilities.

11.10  No Obligations of Borrower.  Nothing contained in this Article
11 shall be deemed to impose upon Borrower any obligation in respect of the due
and punctual performance by the Managing Agent of its obligations to the Banks
under any provision of this Agreement, and Borrower shall have no liability
the Managing Agent or any of the Banks in respect of any failure by the Managing
Agent or any Bank to perform any of its obligations to the Managing Agent or the
Banks under this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
where any provision of this Agreement relating to the payment of any amounts due
and owing under the Loan Documents provides that such payments shall be made by
Borrower to the Managing Agent for the account of the Banks, Borrower's
obligations to the Banks in respect of such payments shall be deemed to be
satisfied upon the making of such payments to the Managing Agent in the manner
provided by this Agreement.

Banking Days after demand, accompanied by an invoice therefor, the reasonable

States of America for any period with respect to which it has failed to provide
Borrower with the appropriate form or forms required by Section 12.21, to the
extent such forms are then required by applicable Laws, and all costs, expenses,
fees and charges payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
filing or recording of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other
instrument or writing to be delivered hereunder or thereunder, or in connection
with any transaction pursuant hereto or thereto, and shall reimburse, hold
harmless and indemnify on the terms set forth in 12.11 the Managing Agent and
the Banks from and against any and all loss, liability or legal or other expense
with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or failure to pay any such
tax, cost, expense, fee or charge or that any of them may suffer or incur by
reason of the failure of any Party to perform any of its Obligations. Any amount
payable to the Managing Agent or any Bank under this Section shall bear interest
from the second Banking Day following the date of demand for payment at the
Default Rate.

12.4  Nature of Banks' Obligations.  The obligations of the Banks
hereunder are several and not joint or joint and several. Nothing contained in
this Agreement or any other Loan Document and no action taken by the Managing
Agent or the Banks or any of them pursuant hereto or thereto may, or may be
deemed to, make the Banks a partnership, an association, a joint venture or
other entity, either among themselves or with the Borrower or any Affiliate of
any of Borrower. Each Bank's obligation to make any Advance pursuant hereto is
several and not joint or joint and several, and in the case of the initial
Advance only is conditioned upon the performance by all other Banks of their
obligations to make initial Advances. A default by any Bank will not increase
the Pro Rata Share of the Commitment attributable to any other Bank. Any Bank
not in default may, if it desires, assume in such proportion as the non-
defaulting Banks agree the obligations of any Bank in default, but is not
obligated to do so. The Managing Agent agrees that it will use its best efforts
either to induce the other Banks to assume the obligations of a Bank in default
or to obtain another Bank, reasonably satisfactory to Borrower, to replace such
a Bank in default.

12.5  Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All representations
and warranties contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any
certificate or other writing delivered by or on behalf of any one or more of the
Parties to any Loan Document, will survive the making of the Loans here under
and the execution and delivery of the Notes, and have been or will be relied
upon by the Managing Agent and each Bank, notwithstanding any investigation made
by the Managing Agent or any Bank or on their behalf.

12.6  Notices.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Loan
Documents, all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications
provided for hereunder or under any other Loan Document must be in writing and
must be mailed, telegraphed, telecopied, dispatched by commercial courier or
delivered to the appropriate party at the address set forth on the signature
pages of this Agreement or other applicable Loan Document or, as to any party to
any Loan Document, at any other address as may be designated by it in a written
notice sent to all other parties to such Loan Document in accordance with this
Section.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in any Loan Document, if any
notice, request, demand, direction or other communication required or permitted
by any Loan Document is given by mail it will be effective on the earlier of
receipt or the fourth Banking Day after deposit in the United States mail with
first class or airmail postage prepaid; if given by telegraph or cable, when
delivered to the telegraph company with charges prepaid; if given by telecopier,
when sent; if dispatched by commercial courier, on the scheduled delivery date;
or if given by personal delivery, when delivered.

12.7  Execution of Loan Documents.  Unless the Managing Agent
otherwise specifies with respect to any Loan Document, (a) this Agreement and
any other Loan Document may be executed in any number of counterparts and any
party hereto or thereto may execute any counterpart, each of which when executed
and delivered will be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, as the case may be, when taken
together will be deemed to be but one and the same instrument and (b) execution
of any such counterpart may be evidenced by a telecopier transmission of the
signature of such party.  The execution of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document by any party hereto or thereto will not become effective until
counterparts hereof or thereof, as the case may be, have been executed by all
the parties hereto or thereto.

<PAGE>

12.8  Binding Effect; Assignment.

(a)       This Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which Borrower are a
Party will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, the
Managing Agent, each of the Banks, and their respective successors and
assigns, except that Borrower may not assign its rights hereunder or
thereunder or any interest herein or therein without the prior written
consent of all the Banks.  Each Bank represents that it is not acquiring
its Note with a view to the distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (subject to any requirement that
disposition of such Note must be within the control of such Bank).  Any
Bank may at any time pledge its Note or any other instrument evidencing its
rights as a Bank under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank, but no
such pledge shall release that Bank from its obligations hereunder or grant
to such Federal Reserve Bank the rights of a Bank hereunder absent
foreclosure of such pledge.

(b)       From time to time following the Closing Date, each Bank may assign to
one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of its Pro Rata Share of
the Commitment; provided that (i) such Eligible Assignee, if not then a
Bank or an Affiliate of the assigning Bank, shall be approved by each of
the Managing Agent and (if no Event of Default then exists) Borrower
(neither of which approvals shall be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
(ii) such assignment shall be evidenced by a Commitment Assignment and
Acceptance, a copy of which shall be furnished to the Managing Agent as
hereinbelow provided, (iii) except in the case of an assignment to an
Affiliate of the assigning Bank, to another Bank or of the entire remaining
Commitment of the assigning Bank, the assign ment shall not assign a Pro
Rata Share of the Commitment that is equivalent to less than $10,000,000,
and (iv) the effective date of any such assignment shall be as specified in
the Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, but not earlier than the date
which is five (5) Banking Days after the date the Managing Agent has
received the Commitment Assignment and Acceptance. Upon the effective date
of such Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee named
therein shall be a Bank for all purposes of this Agreement, with the Pro
Rata Share of the Commitment therein set forth and, to the extent of such
Pro Rata Share, the assigning Bank shall be released from its further
obligations under this Agreement. Borrower agrees that it shall execute and
deliver (against delivery by the assigning Bank to Borrower of its Note) to
such assignee Bank, a Note evidencing that assignee Bank's Pro Rata Share
of the Commitment, and to the assigning Bank, a

<PAGE>

Note evidencing the remaining balance Pro Rata Share retained by the
assigning Bank.

(c)       By executing and delivering a Commitment Assignment and Acceptance,
the Eligible Assignee thereunder acknowledges and agrees that: (i) other
than the representation and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial
owner of the Pro Rata Share of the Commitment being assigned thereby free
and clear of any adverse claim, the assigning Bank has made no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to
any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with
this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,
genuineness or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
(ii) the assigning Bank has made no representation or warranty and assumes
no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of Borrower or
the performance by Borrower of the Obligations; (iii) it has received a
copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial
statements delivered pursuant to Section 8.1 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis
and decision to enter into such Commitment Assignment and Acceptance; (iv)
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Managing Agent or any
Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) it appoints and
authorizes the Managing Agent to take such action and to exercise such
powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Managing Agent by this
Agreement; and (vi) it will perform in accordance with their terms all of
the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be
performed by it as a Bank.

(d)       The Managing Agent shall maintain at the Managing Agent's Office
a copy of each Commitment Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a
register (the "Register") of the names and address of each of the Banks and
the Pro Rata Share of the Commitment held by each Bank, giving effect to
each Commitment Assignment and Acceptance.  The Register shall be available
during normal business hours for inspection by Borrower or any Bank upon
reasonable prior notice to the Managing Agent.  After receipt of a
completed Commitment Assignment and Acceptance executed by any Bank and an
Eligible Assignee, and receipt of an assignment fee of $2,500 from such
Bank or Eligible Assignee, the Managing Agent shall, promptly following the
effective date thereof, provide to Borrower and the Banks a revised
Schedule 1.1 giving effect there to.  Borrower, the Managing Agent and the
Banks shall deem and treat the Persons listed as Banks in the Register as
the holders and

<PAGE>

owners of the Pro Rata Share of the Commitment listed therein for all
purposes hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such Pro Rata Share
of the Commitment shall be effective, in each case unless and until a
Commitment Assignment and Acceptance effecting the assignment or transfer
thereof shall have been accepted by the Managing Agent and recorded in the
Register as provided above. Prior to such recordation, all amounts owed
with respect to the applicable Pro Rata Share of the Commitment shall be
owed to the Bank listed in the Register as the owner thereof, and any
request, authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such
request or giving such authority or consent, is listed in the Register as a
Bank shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, assignee or
transferee of the corresponding Pro Rata Share of the Commitment.

(e)       Each Bank may from time to time grant participations to one or
more banks or other financial institutions (including another Bank) in a
portion of its Pro Rata Share of the Commitment; provided, however, that
(i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the participating banks or
other financial institutions shall not be a Bank hereunder for any purpose
except, if the participation agreement so provides, for the purposes of
Sections 3.7, 3.8, 12.11 and 12.22 but only to the extent that the cost of
such benefits to Borrower does not exceed the cost which Borrower would
have incurred in respect of such Bank absent the participation, (iv)
Borrower, the Managing Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, (v) the participation interest shall
be expressed as a percentage of the granting Bank's Pro Rata Share of the
Commitment as it then exists and shall not restrict an increase in the
Commitment, or in the granting Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Commitment, so
long as the amount of the participation interest is not affected thereby,
and (vi) the consent of the holder of such participation interest shall not
be required for amendments or waivers of provisions of the Loan Documents
other than those which (A) extend the Initial Reduction Date, the Maturity
Date or any other date upon which any payment of money is due to the Banks,
(B) reduce the rate of interest on the Notes, any fee or any other monetary
amount payable to the Banks, (C) reduce the amount of any installment of
principal due under the Notes, or (D) release any material portion of the
Collateral (except as may be otherwise expressly provided for in any Loan
Document).

<PAGE>

(f)       Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the rights
of the Banks to make assignments of, and grant participations in, their Pro
Rata Shares of the Commitment shall be subject to the approval of any
Gaming Board, to the extent required by applicable Gaming Laws, and to
compliance with applicable securities laws.

12.9  Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Managing Agent or any Bank (but in each case only with the
consent of the Requisite Banks) may exercise its rights under Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable Laws and, to the extent permitted
by applicable Laws, apply any funds in any deposit account maintained with it
by Borrower and/or any Property of Borrower in its possession against the
Obligations.

12.10  Sharing of Setoffs.  Each Bank severally agrees that if it,
through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim
against Borrower, or otherwise, receives payment of the Obligations held by it
that is ratably more than any other Bank, through any means, receives in pay
ment of the Obligations held by that Bank, then, subject to applicable Laws:
(a) the Bank exercising the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or
otherwise receiving such payment shall purchase, and shall be deemed to have
simultaneously purchased, from the other Bank a participation in the Obligations
held by the other Bank and shall pay to the other Bank a purchase price in an
amount so that the share of the Obligations held by each Bank after the exercise
of the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment
shall be in the same proportion that existed prior to the exercise of the right
of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment; and (b) such
other adjustments and purchases of participations shall be made from time to
time as shall be equitable to ensure that all of the Banks share any payment
obtained in respect of the Obligations ratably in accordance with each Bank's
share of the Obligations immediately prior to, and without taking into account,
the payment; provided that, if all or any portion of a disproportionate
payment obtained as a result of the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's
lien, counterclaim or otherwise is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank
by Borrower or any Person claiming through or succeeding to the rights of
Borrower, the purchase of a participation shall be rescinded and the purchase
price thereof shall be restored to the extent of the recovery, but without
interest.  Each Bank that purchases a participation in the Obligations pursuant
to this Section shall from and after the purchase have the right to give all
notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this
Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same
extent as though the purchasing Bank were the original owner of the Obligations
purchased.  Borrower expressly consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree
that

<PAGE>

any Bank holding a participation in an Obligation so purchased may exercise any
and all rights of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim with respect to the
participation as fully as if the Bank were the original owner of the Obligation
purchased.

12.11  Indemnity by Borrower.  Borrower agrees to indemnify, save and
hold harmless the Managing Agent and each Bank and their directors, officers,
agents, attorneys and employees (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and
against:  (a) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action (except a
claim, demand, action, or cause of action for any amount excluded from the
definition of "Taxes" in Section 3.12(d)) if the claim, demand, action or cause
of action arises out of or relates to any act or omission (or alleged act or
omission) of Borrower, their Affiliates or any of their officers, directors or
stockholders relating to the Commitment, the use or contemplated use of proceeds
of any Loan, or the relationship of Borrower and the Banks under this Agreement;
(b) any administrative or investigative proceeding by any Governmental Agency
arising out of or related to a claim, demand, action or cause of action
described in clause (a) above; and (c) any and all liabilities, losses, costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and the reasonably allocated
costs of attorneys employed by any Indemnitee and disbursements of such
attorneys and other professional services) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs
as a result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand, action or cause of
action; provided that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any
loss caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or for any loss
asserted against it by another Indemnitee.  If any claim, demand, action or
cause of action is asserted against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall
promptly notify Borrower, but the failure to so promptly notify Borrower shall
not affect Borrower' obligations under this Section unless such failure
materially prejudices Borrower's right to participate in the contest of such
claim, demand, action or cause of action, as hereinafter provided.  Such
Indemnitee may (and shall, if requested by Borrower in writing) contest the
validity, applicability and amount of such claim, demand, action or cause of
action and shall permit Borrower to participate in such contest.  Any Indemnitee
that proposes to settle or compromise any claim or proceeding for which Borrower
may be liable for payment of indemnity hereunder shall give Borrower written
notice of the terms of such proposed settlement or compromise reasonably in
advance of settling or compromising such claim or proceeding and shall obtain
Borrower' prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
In connection with any claim, demand, action or cause of action covered by this
Section against more than one Indemnitee, all such Indemnitees shall be
represented by the same legal counsel (which may be a law firm engaged by the
Indemnitees or attorneys employed by an Indemnitee or a combination of the
foregoing) selected by the

<PAGE>

Indemnitees and reasonably acceptable to Borrower; provided, that if such legal
counsel determines in good faith that representing all such Indemnitees would or
could result in a conflict of interest under Laws or ethical principles
applicable to such legal counsel or that a defense or counterclaim is available
to an Indemnitee that is not available to all such Indemnitees, then to the
extent reasonably necessary to avoid such a conflict of interest or to permit
unqualified assertion of such a defense or counterclaim, each Indemnitee shall
be entitled to separate representation by legal counsel selected by that
Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to Borrower, with all such legal counsel
using reasonable efforts to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort by counsel
for all Indemnitees; and further provided that the Managing Agent (as an
Indemnitee) shall at all times be entitled to representation by separate legal
counsel (which may be a law firm or attorneys employed by the Managing Agent or
a combination of the foregoing).  Any obligation or liability of Borrower to any
Indemnitee under this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of
this Agreement, the repayment of all Loans, the expiration or termination of all
Letters of Credit and the payment and performance of all other Obligations owed
to the Banks.

12.12  Nonliability of the Banks.  Borrower acknowledges and agrees
that:

(a)       Any inspections of any Property of Borrower made by or through
the Managing Agent or the Banks are for purposes of administration of the
Loan only and Borrower is not entitled to rely upon the same (whether or
not such inspections are at the expense of Borrower);

(b)       By accepting or approving anything required to be observed,
performed, fulfilled or given to the Managing Agent or the Banks pursuant
to the Loan Documents neither the Managing Agent nor the Banks shall be
deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency, legality,
effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or
condition thereof, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not
constitute a warranty or representation to anyone with respect thereto by
the Managing Agent or the Banks;

(c)       The relationship between Borrower and the Managing Agent and the
Banks is, and shall at all times remain, solely that of borrower and
lenders; neither the Managing Agent nor the Banks shall under any
circumstance be construed to be partners or joint venturers of Borrower or
its Affiliates; neither the Managing Agent nor the Banks shall under any
circumstance be deemed to be in a relationship of confidence or trust or a
fiduciary or other "special" relationship with Borrower or its

<PAGE>

Affiliates, or to owe any fiduciary duty to Borrower or its Affiliates;
neither the Managing Agent nor the Banks undertake or assume any
responsibility or duty to Borrower or its Affiliates to select, review,
inspect, supervise, pass judgment upon or inform Borrower or its Affiliates
of any matter in connection with their Property or the operations of
Borrower or its Affiliates; Borrower and its Affiliates shall rely entirely
upon their own judgment with respect to such matters; and any review,
inspection, supervision, exercise of judgment or supply of information
undertaken or assumed by the Managing Agent or the Banks in connection with
such matters is solely for the protection of the Managing Agent and the
Banks and neither Borrower nor any other Person is entitled to rely
thereon; and

(d)       The Managing Agent and the Banks shall not be responsible or
liable to any Person for any loss, damage, liability or claim of any kind
relating to injury or death to Persons or damage to Property caused by the
actions, inaction or negligence of Borrower and/or its Affiliates and
Borrower hereby indemnifies and hold the Managing Agent and the Banks
harmless on the terms set forth in Section 12.11 from any such loss,
damage, liability or claim.

12.13  No Third Parties Benefited.  This Agreement is made for the
purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties of
Borrower, the Managing Agent and the Banks in connection with the Loans, and is
made for the sole benefit of Borrower, the Managing Agent and the Banks, and the
Managing Agent's and the Banks' successors and assigns.  Except as provided in
Sections 12.8 and 12.11, no other Person shall have any rights of any nature
hereunder or by reason hereof.

12.14  Confidentiality.  Each Bank agrees to hold any confidential
information that it may receive from Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in
confidence, except for disclosure:  (a) to other Banks; (b) to legal counsel
and accountants for Borrower or any Bank; (c) to other professional advisors to
Borrower or any Bank, provided that the recipient has accepted such information
subject to a confidentiality agreement sub stantially similar to this Section;
(d) to regulatory officials having jurisdiction over that Bank; (e) to any
Gaming Board having regulatory jurisdiction over Borrower or its Subsidiaries,
provided that each Bank agrees to use its best efforts to notify Borrower of any
such disclosure unless prohibited by applicable Laws; (f) as required by Law or
legal process or in connection with any legal proceeding to which that Bank and
Borrower are adverse parties; and (g) to another financial institution in
connection with a disposition or proposed disposition to that financial
institution of all or part of that

<PAGE>

Bank's interests hereunder or a participation interest in its Note, provided
that the recipient has accepted such informa tion subject to a confidentiality
agreement substantially similar to this Section.  For purposes of the foregoing,
"confidential information" shall mean any information respecting Borrower or its
Subsidiaries reasonably considered by Borrower to be confidential, other than
(i) information previously filed with any Governmental Agency and available to
the public, (ii) information previously published in any public medium from a
source other than, directly or indirectly, that Bank, and (iii) information
previously disclosed by Borrower to any Person not associated with Borrower
without a confidentiality agreement or obligation substantially similar to this
Section.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to create or give rise to
any fiduciary duty on the part of the Managing Agent or the Banks to Borrower.

12.15  Further Assurances.  Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall, at
their expense and without expense to the Banks or the Managing Agent, do,
execute and deliver such further acts and documents as the Requisite Banks or
the Managing Agent from time to time reasonably require for the assuring and
confirming unto the Banks or the Managing Agent of the rights hereby created or
intended now or hereafter so to be, or for carrying out the intention or
facilitating the performance of the terms of any Loan Document.

12.16  Integration.  This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents and the letter agreements referred to in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5,
comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on the
subject matter hereof.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control and govern; provided that the inclusion of supplemental
rights or remedies in favor of the Managing Agent or the Banks in any other Loan
Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement.  Each Loan Document
was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and
shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in
accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

12.17  Governing Law.  Except to the extent otherwise provided
therein, each Loan Document shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the local Laws of Nevada.

12.18  Severability of Provisions.  Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable or invalid as to any party or in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that party or jurisdiction, be inoperative,
unenforceable or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions or the

<PAGE>

operation, enforceability or validity of that provision as to any other party or
in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents
are declared to be severable.

12.19  Headings.  Article and Section headings in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents are included for convenience of reference only and are
not part of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents for any other purpose.

12.20  Time of the Essence.  Time is of the essence of the Loan
Documents.

12.21  Foreign Banks and Participants.  Each Bank that is incorporated
or otherwise organized under the Laws of a jurisdiction other than the United
States of America or any State thereof or the District of Columbia shall deliver
to Borrower (with a copy to the Managing Agent), within twenty (20) days after
the Closing Date (or after accepting an assignment or receiving a participation
interest herein pursuant to Section 12.8, if applicable) two duly completed
copies, signed by a Responsible Official, of either Form 1001 (relating to such
Bank and entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding on all payments
to be made to such Bank by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or Form 4224
(relating to all payments to be made to such Bank by Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement) of the United States Internal Revenue Service or such other evidence
(including, if reasonably necessary, Form W-9) satisfactory to Borrower and the
Managing Agent that no withholding under the federal income tax laws is required
with respect to such Bank.  Thereafter and from time to time, each such Bank
shall upon request by Borrower (a) promptly submit to Borrower (with a copy to
the Managing Agent), such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of
such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the
relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then
current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is
satisfactory to Borrower and the Managing Agent of any available exemption from,
United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such
Bank by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and (b) take such steps as shall not
be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank,
and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its
Eurodollar Lending Office, if any) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws
that Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable
to such Bank.  In the event that Borrower or the Managing Agent become aware
that a participation has been granted pursuant to Section 12.8(e) to a financial
institution that is incorporated or otherwise organized under the Laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States of America, any State thereof or the
District of Columbia, then, upon request made by Borrower or

<PAGE>

the Managing Agent to the Bank which granted such participation, such Bank shall
cause such participant financial institution to deliver the same documents and
information to Borrower and the Managing Agent as would be required under this
Section if such financial institution were a Bank.

12.22  Hazardous Material Indemnity.  Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify, hold harmless and defend (by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Managing Agent) the Managing Agent and each of the Banks (and any successor to a
Bank) and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties,
charges, administrative and judicial proceedings and orders, judgments,
remedial action requirements, enforcement actions of any kind, and all costs and
expenses incurred in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and the reasonably allocated costs of attorneys employed by the Managing Agent
or any Bank, and expenses to the extent that the defense of any such action has
not been assumed by Borrower), arising directly or indirectly out of (i) the
presence on, in, under or about any Real Property of any Hazardous Materials, or
any releases or discharges of any Hazardous Materials on, under or from any Real
Property and (ii) any activity carried on or undertaken on or off any Real
Property by Borrower or any of its predecessors in title, whether prior to or
during the term of this Agreement, and whether by Borrower or any predecessor in
title or any employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors of Borrower or
any predecessor in title, or any third persons at any time occupying or present
on any Real Property (other than a Bank or a representative of a Bank), in
connection with the handling, treatment, removal, storage, decontamination,
clean-up, transport or disposal of any Hazardous Materials at any time located
or present on, in, under or about any Real Property.  The foregoing indemnity
shall further apply to any residual contamination on, in, under or about any
Real Property, or affecting any natural resources, and to any contamination of
any Property or natural resources arising in connection with the generation,
use, handling, storage, transport or disposal of any such Hazardous Materials,
and irrespective of whether any of such activities were or will be undertaken in
accordance with applicable Laws, but the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to
Hazardous Materials on any Real Property, the presence of which is caused by the
Managing Agent or the Banks.  Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents to the contrary, the obligations of Borrower under this Section (and
under Sections 4.18 and 5.11) shall be unlimited corporate obligations of
Borrower and shall not be secured by any deed of trust on any Real Property.
Any obligation or liability of Borrower to any Indemnitee under this Section
shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the repayment of
all Loans, the expiration or

<PAGE>

termination of all Letters of Credit and the payment and performance of all
other Obligations owed to the Banks.

12.23  Gaming Boards.  The Managing Agent and each of the Banks agree
to cooperate with all Gaming Boards in connection with the administration of
their regulatory jurisdiction over Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including the
provision of such documents or other information as may be requested by any such
Gaming Board relating to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or to the Loan
Documents.

12.24  Release of Certain Liens.  The Managing Agent shall release the
Liens created by the Collateral Documents in the Leased Equipment concurrently
with the execution and delivery of the Equipment Lease.

12.25  Other Lien Releases.  The Managing Agent shall release any Lien
granted to or held by the Managing Agent on any Collateral (i) sold, transferred
or otherwise disposed of in connection with any transaction not prohibited by
the Loan Documents, (ii) constituting Property leased to Borrower or its
Subsidiaries under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction
not prohibited by the Loan Documents or which will concurrently expire and which
has not been, and is not intended by Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary to be,
renewed or extended, (iii) consisting of an instrument, if the Indebtedness
evidenced by such instrument has been finally repaid in full and (iv) if
approved or consented to by those of the Banks required by Section 12.2.  If the
Collateral so released consists of capital stock of a Subsidiary, then the
Managing Agent shall concurrently also release such Subsidiary from its
obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty.  Upon the request of the Managing
Agent, each Bank shall promptly provide written confirmation of the authority of

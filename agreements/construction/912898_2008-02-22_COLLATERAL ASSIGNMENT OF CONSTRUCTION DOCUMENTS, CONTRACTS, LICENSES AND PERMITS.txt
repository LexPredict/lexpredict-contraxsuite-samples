for loss or damage as provided above, the amount thereof, including, without
limitation, reasonable costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses shall be secured hereby and by the Deed of Trust and all other Loan

Assignor. In the absence of an Event of Default, any amounts incurred by
Administrative Agent or any Lender under this Section 2.f shall bear interest
from the tenth (10th) Banking Day following the date of demand for payment at
the Default Rate.


<PAGE>

g. That this Assignment shall be assignable by Assignee to any
successor to Assignee under the Loan Agreement and all representations,

hypothecated or otherwise encumbered the Assigned Contracts and Permits or any
of them, or its right, title and interest therein, (b) Assignor shall not
assign, sell, pledge, transfer, mortgage, hypothecate or otherwise encumber its
interests in the Assigned Contracts and Permits or any of them except to the
Lenders under the Loan Documents, (c) Assignor has not knowingly performed any
act which might prevent Assignor from performing its undertakings hereunder or
which might prevent Assignee from operating under or enforcing any of the terms
and conditions hereof or which would limit Assignee in such operation or
enforcement, (d) Assignor is not in default under the Assigned Contracts and
Permits, or any of them, and to the best knowledge of Assignor, no other party
to the respective Assigned Contracts and Permits is in default thereunder except
as disclosed in writing to Assignee, (e) except as provided in the Loan
Agreement, no amendments to any of the Assigned Contracts and Permits will be
made without the prior written consent of Assignee, and (f) on or before the
date hereof with respect to the existing Assigned Contracts and Permits, and on
or about the date of the execution of any future Construction Documents,
Assignor will deliver a copy of such Construction Documents (or an original at
Assignee's request) to Assignee and will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such of the parties thereto as Assignee may designate to execute and
deliver to Assignee a consent to this Assignment, such consent to be
substantially in the applicable form of Consent and Agreement attached hereto as
Exhibit A.

4. All notices, demands or documents which are required or permitted to be
given or served hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficiently
given when delivered or mailed in the manner set forth in the Loan Agreement.

5. Any provision in the Loan Agreement that pertains to this Assignment
shall be deemed to be incorporated herein as if such provision were fully set
forth in this Assignment. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
Assignment and the terms of the Loan Agreement, the terms of the Loan Agreement
shall prevail. A provision in this Assignment shall not be deemed to be
inconsistent with the Loan Agreement by reason of the fact that no provision in
the Loan Agreement covers such provision in this Assignment.

6. This Assignment is made for collateral purposes only and the duties and
obligations of Assignor under this Assignment shall terminate when all sums due
Assignee and/or Lenders under the Loan Documents are paid in full and all
obligations, covenants, conditions and agreements of Assignor contained in the
Loan Documents are performed and discharged. This assignment shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, without
regard to the choice of law provisions thereof.

7. It is expressly intended, understood and agreed that this Assignment and
the other Loan Documents are made and entered into for the sole protection and
benefit of Assignor, Assignee, and Lenders and their respective successors and
assigns (but in the case of assigns of Assignor, only to the extent permitted


<PAGE>

hereunder); that no other person or persons shall have any right at any time to
action hereon or rights to the proceeds of the loan evidenced and secured by the
Loan Documents; that such loan proceeds do not constitute a trust fund for the
benefit of any third party; that no third party shall under any circumstances be
entitled to any equitable lien on any such undisbursed loan proceeds at any
time; and that Assignee on behalf of Lenders shall have a lien upon and right to
direct application of any such undisbursed loan proceeds as provided in the Loan
Documents.

8. Assignor and Assignee intend and believe that each provision in this
Assignment comports with all applicable local, state or federal laws and
judicial decisions. However, if any provision or provisions, or if any portion
of any provision or provisions, in this Assignment is found by a court of law to
be in violation of any applicable local, state or federal ordinance, statute,
law, administrative or judicial decision or public policy, and if such court
should declare such portion, provision or provisions of this Assignment to be
illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable as written, then it is the
intent both of Assignor and Assignee that such portion, provision or provisions
shall be given force to the fullest possible extent that they are legal, valid
and enforceable, that the remainder of this Assignment shall be construed as if
such illegal, invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable portion, provision or
provisions were not contained therein and that the rights, obligations and
interests of Assignor and Assignee under the remainder of this Assignment shall
continue in full force and effect.

9. Each Lender is a third party beneficiary of the obligations of Assignor
and the rights and benefits accruing to Assignee hereunder.

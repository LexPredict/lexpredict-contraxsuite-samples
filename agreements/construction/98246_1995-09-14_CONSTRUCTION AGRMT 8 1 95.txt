gregate   principal  amount  of   all  Revolving  Loans  then
outstanding from  such Lender (determined on the basis of the
Dollar Equivalent for each outstanding Alternate Currency Re-
volving Loan),  plus (II)  the aggregate principal  amount of
all  Individual  Currency Loans  then  outstanding from  such
Lender (determined on  the basis of the Dollar  Equivalent of
each  such Individual  Currency Loan),  plus (III)  the SL/LC
Credit  Exposure  of  such  Lender,  shall  not  exceed  such
Lender's Commitment.   During the Commitment Period, the Core
Currency Borrowers may borrow, prepay in whole or in part and
reborrow Revolving Loans under the Aggregate Commitments, all
in accordance  with the terms  and conditions of  this Agree-
ment.

(b)  Subject  to the  terms and  conditions hereof,
Revolving Loans, (i) if to be made in Dollars (each a "Dollar
Revolving  Loan"  and,  collectively, the  "Dollar  Revolving
Loans"),  shall be made to one or more Domestic Borrowers and
shall, at the  option of such  Domestic Borrowers, be  either
ABR  Advances or Eurodollar Advances,  (ii) if to  be made in
French Francs, shall be made to the French Borrower, (iii) if
to be  made  in German  Marks, shall  be made  to the  German
Borrower, (iv)  if to be made in  Japanese Yen, shall be made
to the Japanese Borrower,  and (v) if to be  made in Sterling
Pounds,  shall be  made to  the Sterling  Borrower.   The Re-
volving Loans, together with  all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon,  shall  mature and  be due  and  payable in  the Ap-<PAGE>





plicable Currency on the Maturity Date.

(c)  Subject to  and upon the terms  and conditions
set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender in its individual ca-
pacity agrees to make at any  time and from time to time dur-
ing the Swing Line Commitment Period, a loan or loans (each a
"Swing Line Loan" and,  collectively, the "Swing Line Loans")
to one or  more of the Swing Line Borrowers, which Swing Line
Loans (i) shall, at  the option of the applicable  Swing Line
Borrower, be  made and maintained as Dollar  Swing Line Loans
or Alternate Currency Swing Line Loans in an Available Alter-
nate  Currency, (ii)  may  be repaid  and  reborrowed in  ac-
cordance  with the  provisions hereof,  (iii) shall  not, im-
mediately  after giving  effect  thereto, result  in the  Ag-
gregate Credit Exposure exceeding the  Aggregate Commitments,
and (iv) shall not,  immediately after giving effect thereto,
result in  the aggregate outstanding principal  amount of all
Swing Line  Loans  (determined on  the  basis of  the  Dollar
Equivalent for each outstanding Alternate Currency Swing Line
Loan) exceeding  the Swing Line  Commitment.  The  Swing Line
Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loans at
a time when  any Lender  (other than the  Swing Line  Lender)
shall  be in default of its  obligations under this Agreement
unless the  Swing Line  Lender has entered  into arrangements
satisfactory to it and the Parent to eliminate the Swing Line
Lender's risk  with respect to each  defaulting Lender's par-
ticipation in such Swing  Line Loans.  The Swing  Line Lender
will not make  a Swing  Line Loan (i)  if the  Administrative
Agent or any Lender  by notice to the Swing  Line Lender, the
Parent and the affected Swing Line Borrower prior to the time
such Swing Line  Loan is  to be made,  shall have  determined
that any of the applicable conditions set forth in Sections 5
and  6 have  not been  satisfied  and such  conditions remain
unsatisfied as  of the  requested time  of making such  Swing
Line Loan or (ii) to the extent that immediately after giving
effect thereto the Aggregate Credit Exposure would exceed the
Aggregate Commitments (each a "Non-Swing Loan Event").  Swing
Line Loans shall mature and be due and payable on the earlier
of, with respect  to each Swing Line  Negotiated Rate Advance
and Swing Line  Loan maintained  as an ABR  Advance, (x)  the
last day of the Swing Line Interest Period applicable thereto
and  (y) the  Maturity  Date.   Subject    to  the terms  and
conditions hereof, Swing  Line Loans,  (i) if to  be made  in
Dollars (each  a "Dollar Swing Line  Loan" and, collectively,
the "Dollar Swing Line Loans"), shall be made to one or  more
Domestic Borrowers and shall  be ABR Advances, (ii) if  to be
made  in French Francs, shall be made to the French Borrower,
(iii)  if to be  made in German  Marks, shall be  made to the
German Borrower, (iv) if to be made in Japanese Yen, shall be
made to  the Japanese  Borrower,  and (v)  if to  be made  in
Sterling Pounds, shall be made to the Sterling Borrower.

(d)  On any  Business Day,  the  Swing Line  Lender
may, in its sole  discretion, give notice to the  Lenders and<PAGE>





the Parent (on behalf  of all Swing Line Borrowers)  that its
outstanding Swing Line Loans shall be funded with a borrowing
of Revolving Loans (provided that such notice shall be deemed
to have been automatically given upon the occurrence of a De-
fault or an Event  of Default under Sections 9.1(g)  or (h)),
in  which case one or more borrowings of Revolving Loans con-
stituting ABR Advances (or  constituting one or more Eurodol-
lar Advances specified by the  Parent in accordance with Sec-
tion 2.3(a)) or Alternate Currency Revolving Loans with a one
month  Euro  Interest Period  (or  such  other Euro  Interest
Period(s) specified by the  Parent in accordance with Section
2.3(a))  in the Applicable Currency, as the case may be (each
such borrowing a "Mandatory Borrowing"), shall be made on the
fifth Business Day immediately  succeeding such notice by all
Lenders  pro rata  based on  each such  Lender's Availability
Percentage immediately prior thereto but after giving  effect
to  any prepayment  of Revolving  Loans, Individual  Currency
Loans,  or  Swing Line Loans, or any payment of reimbursement
obligations in respect of  the Letters of Credit, to  be made
simultaneously therewith,  and  the proceeds thereof shall be
applied  directly to the Swing Line Lender to repay the Swing
Line  Lender  for such  outstanding Swing  Line Loans.   Each
Lender hereby  irrevocably agrees to make  Revolving Loans in
Dollars or  the  Applicable Currency,  as  the case  may  be,
pursuant to each  Mandatory Borrowing in respect of any Swing
Line Loan  in the amount and  in the manner specified  in the
preceding  sentence and on  the date specified  in writing by
the Swing  Line Lender notwithstanding (i) the  amount of the
Mandatory Borrowing  may not  comply with the  minimum amount
for  Loans otherwise  required  hereunder, (ii)  whether  any
conditions specified in Sections 5 and  6 are then satisfied,
(iii) whether a Default  or an Event of Default  then exists,
(iv)  the date of such Mandatory Borrowing, (v) the aggregate
principal amount of all Loans then outstanding (determined on
the  basis  of  the  Dollar Equivalent  of  each  outstanding
Alternate Currency Loan), (vi)  the Aggregate Credit Exposure
at  such   time  and  (vii)  the  amount   of  the  Aggregate
Commitments  at such  time, provided  that no  Non-Swing Loan
Event shall have  occurred and be continuing  with respect to
such  Swing Line  Loan.   In  the  event that  any  Mandatory
Borrowing  cannot for  any  reason  be  made  on    the  date
otherwise required above  (including as a result of  the com-
mencement of any proceeding referred to in Sections 9.1(g) or
(h)) then each  Lender hereby agrees that  it shall forthwith
purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing would other-
wise have  occurred, but  adjusted for any  payments received
from the Parent or  the applicable Swing Line Borrower  on or
after  such date and prior  to such purchase)  from the Swing
Line Lender  such assignments in each  outstanding Swing Line
Loan as  shall be necessary to cause  the Lenders to share in
each such Swing Line Loan ratably based upon their respective
Availability  Percentages  at  such time,  provided  that  no
Non-Swing Loan  Event shall  have occurred and  be continuing
with  respect to such  Swing Line Loan,  and provided further<PAGE>





that  all interest payable on each such Swing Line Loan shall
be for the account of the Swing Line Lender until the date as
of which the respective  assignment therein is purchased and,
to the extent attributable to the purchased assignment, shall
be payable to the  relevant Lender from and after  such date.
Each  Lender  agrees promptly  to  indemnify  the Swing  Line
Lender  for any costs or  expenses the Swing  Line Lender may
incur as a  result of the failure  of such Lender  to fulfill
its obligations under this Section 2.1(d).

(e)  Subject  to the  terms and  conditions hereof,
each  Lender in its individual capacity agrees to make at any
time and from  time to  time during the  Commitment Period  a
loan  or loans under one  or more of  its Individual Currency
Commitments (each  an "Individual Currency Loan"  and, as the
context may  require, collectively with  all other Individual
Currency Loans of  such Lender  and, as the  context may  re-
quire, with the Individual Currency Loans of  all other Lend-
ers, the "Individual Currency  Loans") to one or more  of the
applicable Non-Core  Currency Borrowers in the respective Ap-
plicable  Currencies,  provided,  however,  that  immediately
after giving effect thereto:

(i)  the Aggregate Credit Exposure shall not exceed
the Aggregate Commitments,

(ii)  the Aggregate Credit Exposure attributable to
all Loans  and Letters of Credit  designated in Non-Core
Currencies shall not exceed $60,000,000,

(iii)   with  respect to  any Applicable  Currency,
(x) the  aggregate principal  amount  of the  Individual
Currency  Loans  of  such  Lender   designated  in  such
Applicable  Currency  shall  not  exceed  such  Lender's
Individual  Currency  Commitment  for   such  Applicable
Currency  and (y)  the  sum of  the aggregate  principal
amount of  the Individual Currency Loans  of all Lenders
in  such Applicable  Currency and  the Letter  of Credit
Exposure attributable to all Letters of Credit issued in
such Applicable Currency (determined on the basis of the
Dollar Equivalent  of each such Individual Currency Loan
and  each  such  Letter  of  Credit)  shall  not  exceed
$5,000,000, and

(iv) with respect to each  Lender (x) the aggregate
principal amount of  all Individual Currency  Loans then
outstanding from such Lender (determined on the basis of
the Dollar Equivalent of  each such Individual  Currency
Loan), plus  (y) the  aggregate principal amount  of all
Revolving Loans  then outstanding from such  Lender (de-
termined  on the basis of the Dollar Equivalent for each
outstanding Alternate Currency Revolving Loan), plus (z)
the SL/LC Credit Exposure of  such Lender, shall not ex-
ceed such Lender's Commitment.<PAGE>





During the Commitment Period, the Non-Core Currency Borrowers
may borrow, prepay  in whole  or in part  and reborrow  Indi-
vidual Currency Loans under the Aggregate Individual Currency
Commitments, all in accordance  with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

(f)  Subject  to the  terms and  conditions hereof,
Individual Currency  Loans, (i) if  to be made  in Australian
Dollars, shall be made to the Australian Borrower, (ii) if to
be  made in Canadian Dollars,  shall be made  to the Canadian
Borrower, (iii) if to be made in Hong Kong  Dollars, shall be
made to the Hong Kong Borrower, (iv) if to be made in Italian
Lira,  shall be  made to the  Italian Borrower, (v)  if to be
made in Korean  Won, shall  be made to  the Korean  Borrower,
(vi) if to be made in Malaysian Ringgit, shall be made to the
Malaysian Borrower,  (vii) if  to be  made in Mexican  Pesos,
shall be  made to the Mexican Borrower,  (viii) if to be made
in  Philippine  Pesos,  shall   be  made  to  the  Philippine
Borrower, (ix) if to be made in Singaporean Dollars, shall be
made to the Singaporean Borrower, (x)  if to be made in Swiss
Francs, shall be  made to the Swiss  Borrower, (xi) if to  be
made  in New Taiwan Dollars,  shall be made  to the Taiwanese
Borrower, and (xii) if to be made in Thai Baht, shall be made
to the Thai Borrower.  Each Individual Currency Loan shall be
due and payable  on the earlier  of (x) the  last day of  the
Individual  Currency Interest  Period applicable  thereto and
(y) the Maturity Date.

B. Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing

(a)  The  aggregate principal  amount of  each bor-
rowing of Revolving  Loans shall not (x)  in the case of  Re-
volving  Loans  constituting  ABR  Advances,   be  less  than
$500,000 or such amount  and a whole multiple of  $100,000 in
excess thereof,  and (y) in  the case of  Eurodollar Advances
and  Core  Currency Euro  Advances, be less  than $500,000 or
such  amount and  a  whole  multiple  of $100,000  in  excess
thereof (or  an amount  in the applicable  Alternate Currency

amount  plus a  whole multiple  of approximately  $100,000 in
excess thereof in the  case of a borrowing of  Alternate Cur-
rency Revolving Loans), provided, in each case that Mandatory
Borrowings  shall be made in  the amounts required by Section
2.1(d).

(b)  The aggregate principal amount of each borrow-
ing of Swing Line  Loans shall not be  less than $100,000  or
such  amount plus a multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof (or
an amount in the applicable Alternate  Currency having a Dol-

a whole  multiple of approximately $50,000  in excess thereof
in the case of  a borrowing of Alternate Currency  Swing Line
Loans).<PAGE>

matters required by the  immediately preceding sentence to be<PAGE>





specified in the Notice of Borrowing.

(b)  (i) Whenever a Swing  Line Borrower desires to
borrow Swing Line Loans hereunder, the  Parent and such Swing
Line  Borrower shall give the  Swing Line Lender  a Notice of
Borrowing (or  telephonic notice promptly confirmed by deliv-
ery of a Notice of Borrowing) at its office set forth in Sec-
tion 11.2 no later than (x)  1:00 P.M. on the requested  Bor-

clause (x)  above or 10:00  A.M. on such  day in the  case of
clause (y)  or (z)  above.   Each  such notice  shall be  ir-
revocable and specify in each case (A) the name of such Swing
Line Borrower, (B) the  date of such incurrence (which  shall
be a Business Day) (C) the Applicable Currency for such Swing
Line Loans, (D) the aggregate principal  amount of such Swing
Line Loans  (stated in the  Applicable Currency) and  (E) the
requested amount and the requested Swing Line Interest Period

Rate  Advance and  Swing Line  Loan made  as an  ABR Advance.
Upon  receipt from the  Parent and the  applicable Swing Line
Borrower  of a Notice of Borrowing which requests one or more
Swing Line  Negotiated Rate  Advances, the Swing  Line Lender
shall,  following discussion  with  the Parent  regarding the
proposed Swing Line Negotiated Rate for such Swing Line Nego-
tiated Rate  Advance, confirm in  writing to  the Parent  the
applicable  Swing Line  Negotiated  Rate (x)  12:00 Noon  one
Business  Day prior to   the requested Borrowing  Date in the
case  of a  Swing Line  Negotiated Rate  Advance in  Sterling
Pounds and (y) 12:00  Noon two Business Days prior to the re-
quested Borrowing Date in the case of a Swing Line Negotiated
Rate Advance in a Core Currency (other than Dollars and Ster-
ling Pounds).

(ii) Mandatory  Borrowings shall be  made upon
the  notice specified in Section 2.1(d), with each Swing Line
Borrower irrevocably agreeing, by  its borrowing of any Swing

spective  offices set forth in 11.2 a Notice of Borrowing (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed  by delivery of a Notice
of Borrowing) no later  than 11:00 A.M. at least  three Busi-
ness Days' prior to the  requested Borrowing Date in  respect<PAGE>





of  such Individual  Currency Loans,  provided that  any such
notice shall  be deemed to have  been given on  a certain day
only  if  given before  11:00 A.M.  on  such day.    Upon its
receipt of  any such Notice of  Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent  shall promptly confirm in writing  its receipt of such
Notice  of Borrowing  to  each applicable  Lender; only  upon
receipt by such  Lender of such written confirmation from the
Administrative  Agent will  such Notice  of Borrowing  become
effective.  Each  such notice  of the Borrower  shall be  ir-
revocable  and shall  specify (A) the  name of  such Non-Core
Borrower,  (B) the date of  such borrowing (which  shall be a
Business  Day),  (C)   the  Applicable   Currency  for   such
Individual Currency Loans, (D) the aggregate principal amount

(d)  Without  in any way limiting the obligation of
any Borrower  to confirm in writing any  telephonic notice of
any  incurrence of  Loans,  the Administrative  Agent or  the
Swing Line Lender (in the case of any borrowing of Swing Line
Loans),  as the case may  be, may act  without liability upon
the basis of telephonic notice of such borrowing, believed by
the Administrative  Agent or  the Swing Line  Lender, as  the
case may be, in good faith to be from such  Borrower prior to
receipt of written confirmation.

the  Administrative Agent, the proceeds of  all such  Negoti-
ated Rate Loans shall be made available in immediately avail-
able  funds at the Applicable  Payment Office of the Adminis-
trative Agent.  All amounts made available to the Administra-
tive Agent on the applicable  Borrowing Date pursuant to  the
preceding two  sentences will then be made  available on such
date to  the applicable Borrower by  the Administrative Agent
at the Applicable Payment  Office of the Administrative Agent
to the extent of  funds actually received by  the Administra-
tive Agent   no later than 2:30 P.M. (local  time in the city
in  which the proceeds of such loans are to be made available
in accordance with the terms hereof).

(d)  Individual Currency Loans. No later than 12:00<PAGE>





Noon (local time in  the city in  which the proceeds of  such
Individual  Currency Loans  are to  be made available  in ac-
cordance  with the  terms hereof)  on the  relevant Borrowing

ministrative Agent  at the  Applicable Payment Office  of the
Administrative Agent to the extent of funds actually received
by the  Administrative Agent no  later than 2:30  P.M. (local
time in the city in  which the proceeds of such loans  are to
be made available in accordance with the terms hereof).

(e)  Failure  to  Fund.  Unless the  Administrative
Agent  shall  have been  notified by  a  Lender prior  to the
making  of any Loans that such Lender does not intend to make
available  to   the  Administrative  Agent  either  (w)  such
Lender's  portion  of  the   Loans  (other  than  Bid  Loans,
Individual Currency  Loans and  Negotiated Rate Loans)  to be
made on  such date, (x) such Lender's Bid Loan which is to be
made available to the Administrative Agent, (y) such Lender's
Negotiated Rate Loan  which is  to be made  available to  the
Administrative Agent or (z) such Lender's Individual Currency
Loan  which is  to be  made available  to  the Administrative
Agent, the  Administrative Agent may assume  that such Lender
has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on
such Borrowing Date and the Administrative Agent may, in  re-
liance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable
Borrower a  corresponding  amount.    If  such  corresponding
amount is not  in fact made  available to the  Administrative
Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be enti-
tled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such
Lender  together with all costs  and expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent in connection therewith.  If such Lender
does  not pay  such corresponding  amount forthwith  upon the
Administrative  Agent's  demand therefor,  the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower.  The Ad-
ministrative  Agent shall  be entitled  to recover  on demand
from  such Lender  interest on  such corresponding  amount in
respect  of each day from the  date such corresponding amount
was  made  available  by  the Administrative  Agent  to  such
Borrower  until   the  date  such  corresponding   amount  is
recovered by  the Administrative Agent,  at a rate  per annum
equal to  the Federal Funds Rate in effect (or in the case of<PAGE>





Alternate  Currency Loans,  at a rate  based upon  the all-in
cost of funds for  the Applicable Currency) on each  such day
(as  determined by  the Administrative  Agent). If  such cor-
responding amount is not made available by such Lender to the
Administrative Agent within one  Business Day after such Bor-
rowing Date, the Administrative  Agent shall also be entitled
to receive from the applicable Borrower such amount, together
with (w) in the case of a Loan (other than a Bid Loan, an In-
dividual Currency Loan and a Negotiated Rate  Loan), the rate
of interest applicable to such Loan as determined pursuant to
Section 2.8, (x) in the case of Bid Loan,  the applicable in-
terest rate for such  Bid Loan (or  in the case of  Alternate
Currency Bid Loans, at a  rate based upon the all-in  cost of
funds for the Applicable Currency) (y) in the case of a Nego-
tiated Rate Loan, the applicable interest rate for such Nego-
tiated Rate  Loan  (or  in the  case  of  Alternate  Currency
Negotiated Rate Loans, at  a rate based upon the  all-in cost
of  funds for the Applicable Currency), or (z) in the case of
an Individual  Currency Loan, the applicable  rate based upon
the  all-in cost of funds for the Applicable Currency.  Noth-
ing in this  Section shall  be deemed to  relieve any  Lender
from its obligation to  make Loans hereunder or  to prejudice
any rights which the applicable Borrower may have against any
Lender as  a result  of any  failure by such  Lender to  make
Loans hereunder.

(f)  Borrower  Accounts.    Each  Loan  made  to  a
Borrower  shall be  made  to its  applicable payment  account
specified  on Exhibit T  or such  other account which  it may
from  time  to   time  specify  by  written   notice  to  the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

E. Payments.

(a)  Loans and  Fees. Except as  otherwise specifi-
cally provided  herein, each payment, including  each prepay-
ment, of  principal and interest on the  Revolving Loans, the
Individual Currency Loans, the Negotiated Rate Loans, the Bid
Loans, the Facility Fee and  the Letter of Credit Commissions
shall be made by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent at
its Applicable  Payment Office in funds immediately available
to the Administrative Agent at such office by 12:00 Noon (lo-
cal  time in the city in which such Applicable Payment Office
is  located) on the due date for such payment, provided, how-
ever, that unless  an Event  of Default has  occurred and  is
continuing and the Required  Lenders have directed the Admin-
istrative Agent  and the Borrowers  to the contrary,  and the
Administrative Agent  shall have consented thereto, each pay-
ment, including each prepayment, of principal and interest on
the Alternate Currency Bid  Loans, the Alternate Currency Ne-
gotiated Rate Loans, and  the Individual Currency Loans shall
be made directly by the applicable Borrower to the applicable
Lender at  the Applicable  Payment Office  of such  Lender by
12:00 Noon (local time in the city in which such Lender's Ap-<PAGE>





plicable Payment  Office is located).   Promptly upon receipt
by the Administrative Agent  of payments made to it  pursuant
to this Section 2.5(a),  the Administrative Agent shall remit
such payment in like funds as received to the Lenders (x) (i)
in  the case of the Facility Fee, according to the Commitment
Percentage of each Lender, and (ii) in the case of the Letter
of  Credit  Commissions,   the  average  daily   Availability
Percentage  of each Lender for the period in respect of which
such payment was  made and (y) pro rata according  to the ag-
gregate outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans,
the  applicable  Individual  Currency Loans,  the  applicable
Negotiated Rate  Loans or  the applicable  Bid Loans,  as the
case  may be,  of each Lender,  in the case  of principal and
interest thereon.  The Parent and each Lender  shall promptly
notify the  Administrative Agent  of the date  and amount  of
each  direct payment  made by  a Borrower  to such  Lender in
respect of  each Alternate Currency Bid  Loan, each Alternate
Currency  Negotiated Rate  Loan and each  Individual Currency
Loan pursuant to this Section 2.5(a).

(b)  Swing Line Loans. Each payment, including each
prepayment, of principal and interest on the Swing Line Loans
shall  be made by the  applicable Swing Loan  Borrower to the
Administrative  Agent at  its  Applicable  Payment Office  in
funds   immediately available to the  Administrative Agent at
such office  by 12:00 Noon (local  time in the city  in which
such  Applicable Payment Office  is located) on  the due date
for such payment  and, promptly upon  receipt thereof by  the
Administrative Agent, shall be remitted by the Administrative
Agent in like funds as received, to the Swing Line Lender.

(c)  Late Payments. The failure  of any of the Bor-
rowers to make any such payment by the time required above in
this Section  2.5 shall  not constitute a  default hereunder,
provided that  such payment is made on such due date, but any
such payment made after 12:00 Noon (local time in the city in
which such Applicable Payment Office is located) on such  due
date shall be deemed to  have been made on the next  Business
Day for the  purpose of calculating interest  on amounts out-
standing on the applicable Loans.

(d)  Alternate Currencies. The principal of and in-
terest  on each Alternate Currency Loan shall be paid only in
the Applicable Currency for such Alternate Currency Loan.

(e)  Payments  Due on  Days Which are  Not Business
Days. If any payment  hereunder shall be due and payable on a
day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof (except
as otherwise provided herein)  shall be extended to  the next
Business Day and with respect to payments in respect of prin-
cipal  and interest shall  be payable at  the applicable rate
specified herein during such extension.

F.   Conversions<PAGE>





(a)  Each applicable Borrower shall have the option
to convert on  any Business Day all or a  portion of the out-
standing principal amount of ABR Advances (other than ABR Ad-
vances constituting Swing Line Loans), Eurodollar Advances or
Core  Currency Euro Advances  into (i) in the  case of an ABR
Advance, one or more Eurodollar Advances, (ii) in the case of
a Eurodollar Advance, one or more ABR Advances or one or more
new Eurodollar Advances  and (iii) in the case of a Core Cur-
rency  Euro Advance, one or  more new Core  Currency Euro Ad-
vances of the same Core Currency, provided that (A) except as
otherwise  provided in  Section 2.14(b),  Eurodollar Advances
may be converted into ABR Advances or new Eurodollar Advances
only on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the
Eurodollar Advances being converted, (B) except  as otherwise
provided in Section 2.14(b),  Core Currency Euro Advances may
be converted into new Core Currency Euro Advances only on the
last day of the  Interest Period applicable to the  Core Cur-
rency  Euro  Advances being  converted,  (C) the  outstanding
principal amount  of the  new Eurodollar Advances  having the
same Interest Period or  the new Core Currency Euro  Advances
having the same Interest  Period shall be in an  amount equal
to  $500,000 or such amount plus a whole multiple of $100,000
in  excess thereof (or an amount  in the applicable Alternate
Currency having a Dollar Equivalent of approximately $500,000
or  such  amount  plus  a  whole  multiple  of  approximately
$100,000  in excess thereof in the case of such Core Currency
Euro Advances),  (D) the outstanding principal  amount of the
new ABR  Advances shall be in an  amount equal to $500,000 or
such  amount plus  a  whole multiple  of  $100,000 in  excess
thereof, (E) ABR  Advances or Eurodollar Advances  may not be
converted into Eurodollar Advances if any Default or Event of
Default is in existence on the date of the conversion and the
Administrative Agent or the Required  Lenders have determined
that  such a conversion is  not appropriate, and  (F) no con-
version pursuant  to this Section  shall result in  a greater
number of Eurodollar Advances  or Core Currency Euro Advances
than is permitted under Section 2.2(d).

(b)  Each  such conversion shall be effected by the
applicable Borrower by  giving the  Administrative Agent,  at
its office set forth in Section  11.2 prior to 10:00 A.M.  in
the  case of Dollar Loans,  at least two  Business Days prior
written notice and,  in the  case of Core  Currency Euro  Ad-
vances,  at least  three Business  Days prior  written notice
(each a "Notice of Conversion"), specifying the ABR Advances,
the Eurodollar Advances or the Core Currency Euro Advances to
be  so converted, the date of such conversion (which shall be
a Business Day) and,  if to be converted into  Eurodollar Ad-
vances or Core Currency Euro Advances, the Interest Period to
be applicable  thereto.  The Administrative  Agent shall give
each  Lender prompt  notice of  any such  proposed conversion
affecting any of its Loans.

(c)  If with respect to the expiration of an exist-<PAGE>





ing Interest Period for  a Eurodollar Advance or a  Core Cur-
rency Euro  Advance the applicable Borrower has failed to de-
liver a Notice of Conversion  with respect thereto, such Bor-
rower shall be deemed to have elected (i) if a Eurodollar Ad-
vance,  to convert such Eurodollar Advance  to an ABR Advance
and (ii) if  a Core  Currency Euro Advance,  to convert  such
Core  Currency Euro Advance to  a new Core  Currency Euro Ad-
vance with a one month Interest Period, in either case effec-
tive  as of the expiration date of such existing Interest Pe-
riod.

G.   Pro   Rata   Borrowings;  Special   Procedures  and
Assumptions

(a)  Pro  Rata Borrowings. In  connection with each
borrowing  of   Revolving  Loans,  each   Lender  shall  make
available an  amount equal  to the  aggregate amount  of such
Revolving Loans,  multiplied  by such  Lender's  Availability
Percentage calculated in accordance  with Section 2.7(b).  It
is  understood that  no Lender  shall be responsible  for any
default by  any other Lender of  its obligation to make Loans
hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the
Loans  provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the
failure of any other Lender to make its Loans hereunder.

(b)  Special     Procedures    and     Assumptions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

(i)  all  Notices of  Borrowing and  all Letter  of
Credit Requests  to be delivered  to the  Administrative
Agent on the same day shall be delivered to the Adminis-
trative Agent at the same time;

(ii) with respect  to any  Loans (other than  a Bid
Loan or  a Negotiated  Rate Loan)  or Letters  of Credit
requested pursuant  to one or more  Notices of Borrowing
or Letter  of Credit Requests delivered to  the Agent on
the same day, during  the period commencing on the  date
of such delivery to  the Administrative Agent and ending
on  the Borrowing Date of the last such Loan or the date
of issuance of the last such Letter of Credit to be made
or  issued  pursuant to  such  Notices  of Borrowing  or
Letter  of  Credit  Requests   (the  "Borrowing/Issuance
Period"):

(A) no additional Loan  (other than a Bid Loan
or a Negotiated Rate Loan) shall be requested to be
made and  no additional  Letter of Credit  shall be
requested to be issued;

(B)  no Loan (other than a Bid Loan or a Nego-
tiated Rate Loan) shall be voluntarily prepaid; and

(C)  neither  the  Aggregate Commitments,  the<PAGE>





Swing Line Commitment, any Individual Currency Com-
mitment  of any  Lender, nor  the Letter  of Credit
Commitment shall be voluntarily reduced;

(iii)  for purposes of calculating the Availability
Percentage for any Revolving  Loans requested to be made
during any Borrowing/Issuance Period:

(A)    any  payment  of  any  Revolving  Loan,
Individual   Currency  Loan,  Swing  Line  Loan  or
reimbursement  obligation in respect of a Letter of
Credit which  is scheduled  to be made  during such
Borrowing/Issuance Period shall  be deemed to  have
been made immediately prior to the  commencement of
such Borrowing/Issuance Period;

(B) any Letter of Credit which is scheduled to
expire   or   otherwise   terminate   during   such
Borrowing/Issuance Period shall  be deemed to  have
expired or otherwise  terminated immediately  prior
to  the  commencement  of  such  Borrowing/Issuance
Period;

(C) any Individual Currency Loans which are to
be made during such Borrowing/Issuance Period shall
be deemed  to have  been made immediately  prior to
the  making of  any Revolving  Loans or  Swing Line
Loans, or  the issuance  of any Letters  of Credit,
during such Borrowing/Issuance Period; and

(D)  any Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans and
Letters of  Credit which are  to be made  or issued
during  such  Borrowing/Issuance  Period  shall  be
deemed to have been made and issued simultaneously;
and

(iv) the   Availability   Percentage   during   any
Borrowing/Issuance   Period  shall   be  determined   by  the
Administrative Agent in  accordance with this  Section 2.7(b)
on the first day of such  Borrowing/Issuance Period and shall
continue   in   effect  through   the   last   day  of   such
Borrowing/Issuance Period.

H.   Interest

(a)  Each  Domestic Borrower agrees to pay interest
in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each ABR Advance
made to  such Domestic Borrower  from the date  thereof until
the conversion or maturity (whether by acceleration or other-
wise) of such ABR Advance, at a rate per annum which shall be
equal  to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Alternate
Base Rate in effect from time to time.

(b)  Each Domestic Borrower agrees to  pay interest<PAGE>





in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each  Eurodollar
Advance made  to such Domestic Borrower from the date thereof
until the conversion or  maturity (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) of such  Eurodollar Advance, at  a rate per  annum
which shall, during each Interest  Period applicable thereto,
be equal  to the sum of the  Applicable Margin plus the Euro-
dollar Rate for such Interest Period.

(c)  Each Borrower  agrees to pay  interest in  re-
spect of the  unpaid principal amount  of each Core  Currency
Euro  Advance made to such Borrower from the date thereof un-
til the  conversion or  maturity (whether by  acceleration or
otherwise) of such Core  Currency Euro Advance at a  rate per
annum which  shall,  during each  Interest Period  applicable
thereto,  be equal to the  sum of the  Applicable Margin plus
the Core Currency Euro Rate for such Interest Period.

(d)  Each Non-Core Currency Borrower agrees  to pay
interest in respect  of the unpaid  principal amount of  each
Individual Currency Loan made  to such Non-Core Currency Bor-
rower from  the date thereof  until the maturity  (whether by
acceleration or  otherwise) of such Individual  Currency Loan
at a rate per  annum which shall, during the  Interest Period
applicable thereto,  be equal  to the sum  of the  Applicable
Margin plus  the Individual  Currency Rate for  such Interest
Period.

(e)  Each Swing Line Borrower agrees to  pay inter-
est in respect of  the unpaid principal amount of  each Swing
Line Negotiated Rate Advance made to such Swing Line Borrower
from  the  date thereof  until the  maturity (whether  by ac-
celeration or  otherwise) of such Swing  Line Negotiated Rate
Advance  at a rate per annum which shall, during the Interest
Period applicable thereto, be equal to the Swing Line Negoti-
ated Rate for such Interest Period.

(f)  Each Borrower  agrees to pay  interest in  re-

rate per  annum which shall,  during the Interest  Period ap-
plicable  thereto, be equal to the Bid Rate for such Interest
Period.

(g)  Each Borrower  agrees to  pay interest  in re-
spect of the unpaid principal amount of each Negotiated  Rate
Loan  made to such Borrower  from the date  thereof until the
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Nego-
tiated Rate Loan at a rate per annum  which shall, during the
Interest Period  applicable thereto, be equal  to the Negoti-
ated Rate for such Interest Period.

(h)  Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted
by  law, overdue interest in  respect of each  Loan shall, in<PAGE>





each  case, bear interest  at a rate  per annum equal  to the
rate  which is  2% in excess  of the rate  applicable to such
Loan (or in the case of a Dollar Bid Loan or a Dollar Negoti-
ated Rate Loan,  2% in excess of the Alternate  Base Rate, or
in the case of  an Alternate Currency Bid Loan,  an Alternate
Currency Swing  Line Loan,  an Alternate Currency  Negotiated
Rate  Loan, an Individual Currency Loan or a Letter of Credit
designated  in an  Alternate Currency,  2% in  excess of  the
all-in rate determined by the applicable Lender, Issuing Bank
or  Swing Line  Lender, as the  case may  be, as  its cost of
funds in the Applicable Currency or, in the case of such Let-
ter of  Credit, the applicable  Currency) until paid  in full
(whether before of  after the entry  of a judgment  thereon).
If  all or any portion of any reimbursement obligation in re-
spect of a Letter  of Credit designated in Dollars  shall not
be  paid when due (whether at the stated maturity thereof, by
acceleration or  otherwise), such  overdue amount  shall bear
interest at  a rate per  annum  equal  to the Alternate  Base
Rate plus 2%,  from the date of such nonpayment until paid in
full  (whether before  or  after  the  entry  of  a  judgment
thereon).  Any other  overdue amount payable hereunder shall,
to  the extent permitted by law,  bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% until paid  in
full (whether  before  or  after  the  entry  of  a  judgment
thereon).  All such interest shall be payable on demand.

(i)  Accrued  (and   theretofore  unpaid)  interest
shall be payable (i)  in respect of each ABR  Advance consti-
tuting a Revolving Loan,  quarterly in arrears on each  Quar-
terly Payment  Date, (ii) in  respect of each  Eurodollar Ad-
vance and each Core Currency Euro Advance, on the last day of
each  Interest Period applicable thereto and,  in the case of
an  Interest Period in excess  of three months,  on each date
occurring at  three month  intervals after  the first day  of
such  Interest Period, (iii) in respect of each Bid Loan, Ne-
gotiated Rate Loan, Individual  Currency Loan, Swing Line Ne-
gotiated Rate Advance and  ABR Advance made as a  Swing Loan,
on the  last day of  the Interest Period  applicable thereto,
and (iv) in respect of each Loan, on any repayment or prepay-
ment (on the amount repaid or  prepaid), at maturity (whether
by acceleration  or otherwise)  and, after such  maturity, on
demand.

(j)  The Administrative Agent  shall determine  the
respective interest rate for  each Interest Period applicable
to  a Eurodollar  Advance or Core  Currency Euro  Advance for
which such determination is being made and shall promptly no-
tify the applicable Borrower and the Lenders thereof.

(k)  Interest on  all Loans shall be  calculated on
the  basis of a  360 day year  for the actual  number of days
elapsed except that  interest on ABR  Advances to the  extent
based on the  BNY Rate,  interest on Core  Currency Euro  Ad-
vances in Sterling Pounds and interest on Individual Currency<PAGE>





Loans  designated  in Australian  Dollars,  Canadian Dollars,
Italian Lira  and New Taiwan  Dollars shall be  calculated on
the basis of a 365 or 366-day year (as the case may be).  Any
change in the  interest rate  on the Loans  resulting from  a
change in the Alternate  Base Rate or the Federal  Funds Rate
shall become effective as  of the opening of business  on the
day  on  which such  change  shall  become  effective.    The
Administrative Agent  shall, as  soon as  practicable, notify
the  Parent (on behalf of  all Borrowers) and  the Lenders of
the effective date and  the amount of each change in  the BNY
Rate, but  any failure so  to notify shall not  in any manner
affect the obligation of the Borrowers to pay interest on the
Loans  in  the  amounts and  on  the  dates  required.   Each
determination of  (i) the  Alternate Base Rate,  a Eurodollar
Rate   or  a Core  Currency Euro  Rate by  the Administrative
Agent,  (ii) an  Individual Currency  Rate by  the applicable
Lender, and (iii)  an all-in cost of funds rate   or any rate
based thereon  by the  Administrative Agent or  the Reference
Lender, or such  applicable Lender,  as the case  may be,  in
each case  pursuant to this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on  all parties  hereto absent  manifest error.   The
Borrowers acknowledge that to  the extent interest payable on
ABR Advances is based on the  BNY Rate, such Rate is only one
of  the bases  for computing  interest on  loans made  by the
Lenders, and by  basing interest payable  on ABR Advances  on
the BNY Rate, the  Lenders have not committed to  charge, and
the  Borrowers have not  in any  way bargained  for, interest
based on a lower or the lowest rate at which  the Lenders may
now or in the future make loans to other borrowers.

(l)  Decreases in the  Applicable Margin  resulting
from a change in Pricing Levels I, II, III, IV and/or V shall
become effective upon the  delivery by the Parent to  the Ad-
ministrative  Agent  of  a  certificate  of  the  Responsible
Officer certifying as to a change in the Rating by Moody's or
S&P  of the  senior unsecured  long term  debt rating  of the
Parent.  Increases in the Applicable Margin shall become  ef-
fective on  the effective date of any downgrade or withdrawal
in the Rating by Moody's or S&P of the senior  unsecured long
term debt rating of the Parent.

(m)  If  the Reference Lender  shall for any reason
no longer be  a Lender, it  shall thereupon  cease to be  the
Reference Lender.  The  Administrative Agent shall, by notice
to the Borrowers and the Lenders, designate another Lender as
the Reference Lender so that  there shall at all times  be at
least one Reference Lender.   The Reference Lender shall  use
its best efforts to furnish quotations of rates to the Admin-
istrative Agent on a timely basis as contemplated hereby.

I.   Termination or Reduction of  Aggregate Commitments,
Swing  Line Commitment,  Individual Currency  Commitments and
Letter of Credit Commitment<PAGE>





(a)  Voluntary  Reductions.  The Parent  shall have
the right, upon at  least three Business Days' prior  written
notice to the Administrative Agent,  at any time to terminate
the Aggregate Commitments or  the Letter of Credit Commitment
or from time to time to reduce permanently the Aggregate Com-
mitments or  the Letter of Credit  Commitment, provided, how-
ever,  that  any such  reduction shall  be  in the  amount of
$10,000,000  or   such  amount  plus  a   whole  multiple  of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof.

(b)  Swing Line  Commitment. The Parent  shall have
the right, upon  at least three Business  Days' prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender,
at any time, to reduce permanently the Swing  Line Commitment
in  whole at any  time, or in  part from time to  time, to an
amount  not less than the  aggregate principal balance of the
Swing Line Loans then outstanding (after giving effect to any
contemporaneous  prepayment thereof) without  premium or pen-
alty, provided that each partial reduction of the Swing  Line
Commitment shall be in an amount equal to $10,000,000 or such
amount plus a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

(c)  Individual  Currency  Commitments. The  Parent
shall  have the  right, upon  at  least three  Business Days'
prior written notice  to the Administrative Agent and the ap-
plicable Lender, at any time, to reduce permanently any Indi-
vidual  Currency Commitment of  such Lender  in whole  at any
time, or in  part from time  to time, to  an amount not  less
than the  aggregate principal balance of  the Individual Cur-
rency Loans of such Lender  then outstanding under such Indi-
vidual Currency  Commitment (after giving effect  to any con-
temporaneous prepayment  thereof) without premium  or penalty
provided that each partial  reduction of such Individual Cur-
rency Commitment shall be in an amount in the applicable Non-
Core Currency  having  a Dollar  Equivalent of  approximately
$1,000,000  or  such  amount  plus a  whole  multiple  of ap-
proximately $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

(d)  In  General. Each  reduction of  the Aggregate
Commitments  shall  be  applied  pro rata  according  to  the
Commitment Percentage  of each Lender, and  each reduction in
the Letter  of Credit  Commitment shall be  applied pro  rata
according to  the Availability  Percentage of each  Lender at
the time of such reduction.   Simultaneously with each reduc-
tion  of the  Aggregate Commitments  under this  Section, the
Borrowers shall pay the Facility Fee accrued on the amount by
which   the   Aggregate   Commitments  have   been   reduced.
Simultaneously with each reduction  of the Aggregate  Commit-
ments, the Swing Line  Commitment and the Individual Currency
Commitments, the Borrowers shall prepay the Loans as required
by  Section 2.10.  The Aggregate Commitments shall not be re-
duced below an  amount equal to the Aggregate Credit Exposure
(after  giving effect to any prepayment of the Loans made si-
multaneously  with  such reduction  of the  Aggregate Commit-<PAGE>





ments). The Aggregate Commitments shall not be reduced to the
extent,   immediately  after   giving  effect   thereto,  the
Commitment of any Lender  would exceed the sum of (I) the ag-
gregate  principal  amount   of  all  Revolving   Loans  then
outstanding from such Lender (determined on the basis  of the
Dollar Equivalent for each outstanding Alternate Currency Re-
volving Loan),  plus (II)  the aggregate principal  amount of
all  Individual Currency  Loans  then  outstanding from  such
Lender (determined on the basis  of the Dollar Equivalent  of
each  such Individual  Currency Loan),  plus (III)  the SL/LC
Credit  Exposure  of  such   Lender.  The  Letter  of  Credit
Commitment  shall not be reduced below an amount equal to the
Letter of Credit Exposure.

J. Prepayments of the Loans

(a)  Voluntary Prepayments. Each  Borrower may,  at
its  option, prepay the  Loans made to  such Borrower without
premium  or penalty, (x) in  the case of  Revolving Loans and
Swing Loans,  in full  at any  time or in  part from  time to
time, and (y) in the case of Negotiated Rate Loans, Bid Loans
and Individual Currency Loans,  in full at any time,  in each
case  by notifying  the  Administrative Agent  in writing  at
least three  Business Days  prior to the  proposed prepayment
date, identifying the Loans to be prepaid as Revolving Loans,
Swing Line Loans,  Negotiated Rate Loans, Bid  Loans or Indi-
vidual Currency Loans and specifying whether the  Loans to be
prepaid  consist of ABR  Advances, Eurodollar  Advances, Core
Currency  Euro Advances  or  Swing Line  Negotiated Rate  Ad-
vances, or  a combination thereof,  the amount to  be prepaid
and the date of prepayment.  Such notice shall be irrevocable
and the amount specified in such notice shall be due and pay-
able on the date specified, together with accrued interest to
the date of such payment on the amount prepaid.  Upon receipt
of such  notice, the Administrative Agent  shall promptly no-
tify  each Lender thereof in the case of Revolving Loans, the
Swing Line  Lender in  the case  of Swing  Loans and  the ap-
plicable  Lender or Lenders in the case of Bid Loans, Negoti-
ated Rate Loans and Individual  Currency Loans.  Each partial
prepayment of ABR Advances  pursuant to this subsection shall
be  in an  aggregate  principal amount  of  $100,000 or  such
amount  plus a whole  multiple of $50,000  in excess thereof,
or, if  less, the  outstanding principal  balance of the  ABR
Advances.  After giving effect to any partial prepayment with
respect to Eurodollar Advances or Core Currency Euro Advances
which were  made (whether as the  result of a  borrowing or a
conversion)  on the same date and which had the same Interest
Period, the outstanding principal  amount of such  Eurodollar
Advances or Core Currency  Euro Advances shall equal (subject
to Section 2.6) $500,000 or such amount plus a whole multiple
of  $100,000 in  excess  thereof (or  the Alternate  Currency
Equivalent of  approximately $500,000  or such amount  plus a
whole multiple of approximately $100,000 in excess thereof in
the case of a prepayment of Core Currency Euro Advances). <PAGE>





(b)  Mandatory Prepayments of Loans.

(i) Subject to clause  (ii) below with respect
to  Swing Line Loans and  clause (iii) below  with respect to
the Individual Currency Loans of  each Lender, simultaneously
with each  reduction of the Aggregate  Commitments under Sec-
tion 2.9, the Borrowers shall prepay the Loans by the amount,
if any,  by which the  Aggregate Credit Exposure  exceeds the
amount of the Aggregate Commitments as so reduced.

(ii) Simultaneously with each reduction of the
Swing Line Commitment under Section  2.9, the Swing Line Bor-
rowers  shall prepay the Swing  Line Loans by  the amount, if
any, by which the outstanding principal balance of  the Swing
Line  Loans (determined on the basis of the Dollar Equivalent
for each outstanding Alternate  Currency Swing Line Loan) ex-
ceeds the amount of the Swing Line Commitment as so reduced.

(iii)  Simultaneously  with each  reduction of
the Individual  Currency Commitment of any  Lender under Sec-
tion 2.9,  the  applicable Non-Core  Currency Borrower  shall
prepay the Individual Currency  Loans made by such  Lender to
such Non-Core  Currency Borrower under  such Individual  Cur-
rency Commitment by  the amount,  if any, by  which the  out-
standing  principal balance of such Individual Currency Loans
exceeds the amount of  such Individual Currency Commitment as
so reduced.

(iv) If on any date that the Dollar Equivalent
is required  to be  calculated pursuant  to Section  11.6 the
Aggregate Credit Exposure shall  exceed the Aggregate Commit-
ments,  the Borrowers shall prepay the  Loans in an aggregate
principal amount such  that immediately  after giving  effect
thereto, the  Aggregate Credit Exposure shall  not exceed the
Aggregate Commitments.

(v) If on any  date that the Dollar Equivalent
is  required to  be calculated  pursuant to Section  11.6 the
Aggregate Credit  Exposure  attributable  to  all  Loans  and
Letters  of  Credit designated  in Non-Core  Currencies shall
exceed $60,000,000, the Borrowers  shall prepay such Loans in
an aggregate  principal  amount such  that immediately  after
giving   effect  thereto,   the  Aggregate   Credit  Exposure
attributable to all Loans and Letters of Credit designated in
Non-Core Currencies shall not exceed $60,000,000.

(c)  In General.  If any prepayment is  made in re-
spect of any Eurodollar  Advance, Core Currency Euro Advance,
Swing Line Negotiated Rate Advance, Individual Currency Loan,
Negotiated Rate Loan or Bid Loan, in whole or in  part, prior
to  the last day  of the Interest  Period applicable thereto,
the applicable  Borrower agrees  to indemnify the  Lenders in
accordance with Section 2.15.<PAGE>





K. Bid Loans; Procedure

(a)  Each Borrower  may make Bid Requests  by 12:00
Noon (i) at  least two  Business Days prior  to the  proposed
Borrowing Date for one or  more Bid Loans.  Each Bid  Request
shall  be  given to  the  Administrative  Agent (which  shall
promptly on the same  day give notice thereof to  each Lender
by facsimile of  an Invitation to Bid  if the Bid  Request is
not rejected pursuant to this Section), shall be by telephone
(confirmed in   writing promptly on the  same day by the  de-
livery of a Bid  Request signed by the applicable  Borrower),
and  shall specify  (i)  the proposed  Borrowing Date,  which
shall be a  Business Day,  (ii) the aggregate  amount of  the
requested Bid  Loans (the "Maximum Request")  which shall not
(A) exceed an  amount which, on the proposed  Borrowing Date,
and  after giving effect to the proposed Bid Loans, would re-
sult in (x)  the Aggregate Credit Exposure  exceeding the Ag-
gregate Commitments or (y)  the Aggregate Credit Exposure at-
tributable to  all Loans and Letters of  Credit designated in
Non-Core Currencies  exceeding $60,000,000,  or (B) with  re-
spect to each Bid  Loan be less than $500,000 or  such amount
plus a whole multiple  of $100,000 in excess thereof  (or ap-
proximately the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case  of Al-
ternate Currency Bid Loans), (iii) the Bid Interest Period(s)
(up  to three Bid Interest  Periods may be requested pursuant
to each Bid  Request) therefor and the last day  of each such
Interest Period and (iv) the Applicable Currency for each Bid
Loan.  A Bid  Request that does not conform  substantially to
the form  of Exhibit F shall be rejected, and the Administra-
tive Agent  shall promptly notify the  applicable Borrower of
such rejection.

(b)  Each Lender in its sole discretion may (but is
not  obligated to) submit one or more Bids to the Administra-
tive Agent  and the Parent not  later than 9:30  A.M. (i) one
Business Day  prior to the proposed  Borrowing Date specified
in such Bid Request in the case of a Bid Loan (such 9:30 A.M.
time  on such Business Days  each being herein  called a "Bid
Submission Deadline"), by fax or  in writing, and thereby ir-
revocably  offer to make all  or any part  (any such part re-
ferred to as  a "Portion") of any  Bid Loan described  in the
relevant Bid Request, at a rate of interest per annum (each a
"Bid  Rate") specified  therein,  in  an aggregate  principal
amount of not less than $500,000 or such amount  plus a whole
multiple of $100,000 in  excess thereof (or approximately the
Dollar Equivalent  thereof in the case  of Alternate Currency
Bid  Loans), provided  that  Bids submitted  by the  Adminis-
trative  Agent may  only be  submitted if  the Administrative
Agent notifies the Parent and the  applicable Borrower of the
terms of its Bid not later than fifteen minutes prior  to the
Bid Submission Deadline.   Multiple Bids may be  delivered to
and  by the Administrative Agent.   The aggregate Portions of
Bid Loans for  any or  all Interest Periods  offered by  each
Lender in its Bid may exceed the Maximum Request contained in<PAGE>





the relevant Bid  Request, provided that  each Bid shall  set
forth the maximum aggregate  amount of the Bid Loans  offered
thereby  which  the  applicable   Borrower  may  accept  (the
"Maximum Offer"),  which Maximum  Offer shall not  exceed the
Maximum Request.

(c)  The Administrative Agent  shall promptly  give
notice by  telephone (promptly  confirmed in writing)  to the
Parent  and the applicable  Borrower of all  Bids received by
the  Administrative  Agent which comply  in all material  re-
spects with  this Section prior  to the Bid  Submission Dead-
line.  The applicable Borrower  shall, in its sole discretion
but subject to Section  2.11(d), irrevocably accept or reject
any  such Bid (or any  Portion thereof) not  later than 10:30
A.M. one Business Day prior to the proposed Borrowing Date by
notice to the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed in
writing in  the form of  a Bid Accept/Reject  Letter promptly
the  same day).  Promptly on  the day  of the  Bid Submission
Deadline, the  Administrative Agent  will give notice  in the
form of a Bid Loan Confirmation to each Lender that submitted
a Bid  as to the extent, if any, that such Lender's Bid shall
have been accepted.  If the Administrative Agent fails to re-
ceive notice  from the applicable Borrower  of its acceptance
or rejection of any Bids at or prior to 10:30 A.M. on the ap-
plicable day, all such  Bids shall be deemed to have been re-
jected  by  the applicable  Borrower, and  the Administrative
Agent will give to  each Lender which submitted a  Bid notice
of such rejection by telephone on such day.

(d)  If  the applicable Borrower  accepts a Portion
of a  proposed Bid Loan for  a single Interest Period  at the
Bid Rate  provided therefor in  a Lender's Bid,  such Portion
shall be in  a principal  amount of $500,000  or such  amount
plus a whole multiple  of $100,000 in excess thereof  (or ap-
proximately the Dollar Equivalent thereof  in the case of Al-
ternate Currency  Bid Loans), subject to  such lesser alloca-
tion as may  be made pursuant to the provisions  of this sub-
section.   The  aggregate principal  amount of Bid  Loans ac-
cepted by the  applicable Borrower following  Bids responding
to a Bid Request  shall not exceed the Maximum  Request.  The
aggregate  principal amount of Bid Loans  accepted by the ap-
plicable Borrower pursuant to a Lender's Bid shall not exceed
the Maximum Offer  therein contained.  If the applicable Bor-
rower  accepts any Bid Loans  or Portion offered  in any Bid,
the applicable Borrower must accept  Bids (and Bid Loans  and
Portions  thereby offered) based exclusively upon the succes-
sively lowest  Bid Rates within  each Interest Period  and no
other  criteria.   If two  or more  Lenders submit  Bids with
identical  Bid Rates for the same Bid Interest Period and the
applicable Borrower accepts any  thereof, the applicable Bor-
rower shall,  subject to  the first three  sentences of  this
subsection, accept  all such  Bids as  nearly as possible  in
proportion to  the amounts  of such Lender's  respective Bids
with identical Bid Rates for  such Bid Interest Period,  pro-<PAGE>





vided, that if the amount of Bid Loans to be  so allocated is
not  sufficient to enable each  such Lender to  make such Bid
Loan (or  Portions thereof) in an  aggregate principal amount
of  $500,000 or such amount plus a whole multiple of $100,000
in excess  thereof (or the  Dollar Equivalent thereof  in the
case  of   Alternate  Currency  Bid  Loans),  the  applicable
Borrower shall round  the Bid Loans (or Portions thereof) al-
located to such Lender or Lenders as the applicable  Borrower
shall  select as necessary to  a minimum of  $500,000 or such
amount plus a  whole multiple of  $100,000 in excess  thereof
(or the  Dollar Equivalent thereof  in the case  of Alternate
Currency Bid Loans).

(e)  Each Lender  which makes a Bid  Loan shall no-
tify the Administrative Agent  promptly of the making thereof
(unless  the proceeds of such  Bid Loan were  advanced to the
Administrative Agent).

(f)  All notices required by this  Section shall be
given in accordance with Section 11.2.

(g)  Each Bid Loan shall be due  and payable on the
earlier of (x) the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto and (y) the Maturity Date.

L. Negotiated Rate Loans; Procedure

(a)  If at  any time  any Borrower, any  Lender and
the  Parent shall have agreed  that such Lender  shall make a
Negotiated Rate Loan to such  Borrower, such Borrower and the
Parent shall promptly  execute and deliver  to such Lender  a
Negotiated Rate Confirmation Request, specifying (i) the pro-
posed Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, (ii) the
aggregate amount of the  requested Negotiated Rate Loan which
shall not (A) exceed an amount which, on the proposed Borrow-
ing Date, and after giving effect to  the proposed Negotiated
Rate Loan, would result in (x) the Aggregate Credit  Exposure
exceeding  the Aggregate  Commitments  or  (y) the  Aggregate
Credit  Exposure attributable  to  all Loans  and Letters  of
Credit   designated   in   Non-Core    Currencies   exceeding
$60,000,000, or (B) be less than $100,000 or such amount plus
a whole  multiple  of  $50,000  in  excess  thereof  (or  ap-
proximately the Dollar  Equivalent thereof in the case of Al-
ternate Currency Negotiated Rate Loans), (iii) the applicable
rate of  interest therefor (the "Negotiated  Rate"), (iv) the
Negotiated Rate Interest Period therefor and the last day  of
such Negotiated Rate Interest  Period, and (v) the Applicable
Currency therefor.  If  such Negotiated Rate Confirmation Re-
quest  is  in all  respects satisfactory  to such  Lender, it
shall promptly sign a copy thereof and deliver a copy thereof
to  such Borrower,  the Parent  and the  Administrative Agent
(the "Negotiated Rate Confirmation").

(b)  Each Lender which makes a Negotiated Rate Loan<PAGE>





shall notify the Administrative  Agent promptly of the making
thereof  (unless the  proceeds of  such Negotiated  Rate Loan
were advanced to the Administrative Agent).

(c)  All notices required by this  Section shall be
given in accordance with Section 11.2.

(d)  Each  Negotiated Rate  Loan shall  be due  and
payable on  the earlier of (x)  the last day of  the Interest
Period applicable thereto and (y) the Maturity Date.

M. Taxes

(a)  Payments to Be Free and Clear. All payments by
each Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made free and
clear  of, and without any  deduction or withholding for, any
Indemnified Tax.  If any Credit Party or any other  Person is
required  by  any law,  rule,  regulation, order,  directive,
treaty  or guideline  to  make any  deduction or  withholding
(which deduction  or withholding would constitute an Indemni-
fied Tax) from any  amount required to be paid by  any Credit
Party to or on behalf of any Indemnified Tax Person under any
Loan Document (each a "Required Payment"):

(i)  such Credit Party shall notify the Admin-
istrative Agent and  such Indemnified Tax Person  of any such
requirement  or any change in any such requirement as soon as
such Credit Party becomes aware of it;

(ii) such Credit Party shall pay such  Indemni-
fied Tax before the  date on which penalties  attach thereto,
such payment to be  made (if the liability to pay  is imposed
on such  Credit Party) for  its own  account or  (if the  li-
ability is imposed  on such Indemnified Tax Person) on behalf
of and in the name of such Indemnified Tax Person;

(iii) such Credit Party shall pay to such Indem-
nified Tax  Person an additional amount such that such Indem-
nified Tax Person shall receive on the due date therefor   an
amount equal to the Required Payment had no such deduction or
withholding been required; and

(iv) such  Credit Party  shall, within  30 days
after paying such Indemnified Tax, deliver to the Administra-
tive Agent  and the applicable Indemnified  Tax Person satis-
factory evidence of such payment to the relevant Governmental
Authority.

(b)  Other Indemnified Taxes. If an Indemnified Tax
Person or any affiliate thereof is required by any law, rule,
regulation, order, directive, treaty  or guideline to pay any
Indemnified Tax  (excluding an Indemnified Tax  which is sub-
ject to Section 2.13(a)) with respect to any sum paid or pay-
able by any Credit Party to such Indemnified Tax Person under<PAGE>





the Loan Documents:

(i)  such Indemnified Tax  Person shall notify
such Credit Party of any such payment of Indemnified Tax; and

(ii) such Credit Party shall pay to such Indem-
nified Tax Person the amount of such Indemnified Tax within 5
days of such notice.

(c) Tax  on Indemnified  Taxes. If any  amounts are
payable  by a  Credit Party  in respect of  Indemnified Taxes
pursuant to Section 2.13(a) or  (b), such Credit Party agrees
to pay to  the applicable  Indemnified Tax  Person, within  5
Business Days of written request therefor, an amount equal to
all  Taxes  imposed with  respect  to  such  amounts as  such
Indemnified  Tax Person  shall  determine in  good faith  are
payable  by  such Indemnified  Tax  Person  or any  affiliate
thereof  in respect  of such  amounts and  in respect  of any
amounts paid to or  on behalf of such Indemnified  Tax Person
pursuant to this clause (c).

(d)  Exception  for Existing Taxes. No amount shall
be  required to be paid  to any Indemnified  Tax Person under
Section 2.13(a)(iii)  or (b)  with respect to  an Indemnified
Tax to the extent  that such Indemnified Tax would  have been
required to have  been paid under any  law, rule, regulation,
order, directive, treaty or guideline in effect on the Effec-
tive Date.

(e)  U.S. Tax Certificates. Each Lender that is or-
ganized under the  laws of  any jurisdiction  other than  the
United States or any  political subdivision thereof shall de-
liver  to the  Administrative Agent  for transmission  to the
Parent, on or prior to the first Borrowing Date (in the  case
of  each Lender listed on  the signature pages  hereof) or on
the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement
or master  assignment and  acceptance agreement   pursuant to
which  it becomes a Lender in accordance with Section 11.1 or
11.7, (in  the case of each other  Lender), and at such other
times as may be necessary in the determination of the Parent,
any Credit  Party or the  Administrative Agent  (each in  the
reasonable  exercise of  its discretion),  such certificates,
documents or other evidence,  properly completed and duly ex-
ecuted by such Lender (including, without limitation,  Inter-
nal Revenue Service Form 1001 or Form 4224) to establish that
such  Lender is  not subject to  deduction or  withholding of
United States federal income  tax under Section 1441 or  1442
of the Code or otherwise  (or under any comparable provisions
of any successor  statute) with  respect to  any payments  to
such  Lender of  principal, interest,  fees or  other amounts
payable under the Loan  Documents.  No Credit Party  shall be
required  to pay any additional amount to any such Lender un-
der Section 2.13(a)(iii) if such  Lender shall have failed to
satisfy the requirements  of the  immediately preceding  sen-<PAGE>





tence; provided that if such Lender shall have satisfied such
requirements on the first Borrowing Date (in the case of each
Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on the effec-
tive date of the  Assignment and Acceptance Agreement or mas-
ter assignment and acceptance  agreement pursuant to which it
became a Lender (in  the case of each other  Lender), nothing
in  this subsection shall relieve any Credit Party of its ob-
ligation to  pay any  additional amounts pursuant  to Section
2.13(a)(iii) in the event that, as  a result of any change in
applicable law (including, without  limitation, any change in
the interpretation  thereof), such Lender is  no longer prop-
erly  entitled  to deliver  certificates, documents  or other
evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such
Lender  is not subject to withholding as described in the im-
mediately preceding sentence.

(f)  Other Tax Certificates.  Each Indemnified  Tax
Person  agrees to use  reasonable efforts  to deliver  to any
Credit Party, promptly upon any request therefor from time to
time by such Credit Party, such forms, documents and informa-
tion  as may  be required  by applicable  law, regulation  or
treaty from time to time and to file all appropriate forms to
obtain a certificate or  other appropriate documents from the
appropriate  Governmental Authorities to  establish that pay-
ments  made in respect of any Alternate Currency Loan or Let-
ter of  Credit designated  in an  Alternate Currency  by such
Credit  Party can be  made without (or at  a reduced rate of)
withholding of Taxes, provided,  however, that if such Indem-
nified Tax Person is  or becomes unable by virtue  of any ap-
plicable law, regulation or  treaty, to establish such exemp-
tion or reduction, such Credit Party shall nonetheless remain
obligated   under  Subsection  2.13(a)  to  pay  the  amounts
described therein, and provided further,  that no Indemnified
Tax Person  shall be  required to  take any action  hereunder
which, in the sole discretion of such Indemnified Tax Person,
would  cause such  Indemnified  Tax Person  or any  affiliate
thereof to  suffer a  material economic, legal  or regulatory
disadvantage.

(g)  Adverse Tax Position.

(i)  An "Excess  Tax" shall  be the  excess of
(x) the Tax imposed, levied,  collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority  without the United States from
which  a payment is  made by or  on behalf of  a Credit Party
subject  to an Adverse Tax  Position or in  which such Credit
Party or an affiliate has an  office or is deemed to be doing
business, over  (y) the Tax  which would be  imposed, levied,
collected, withheld or assessed by such  Governmental Author-
ity, but for the existence of such Adverse Tax Position.

(ii) An "Adverse Tax Position" with respect to
a  Credit Party shall mean a position resulting from the lack
of adequate capitalization  or other  similar condition  with<PAGE>





respect to  such Credit Party which, under  applicable law or
applicable treaty, results in  higher Taxes on payments under
the Loan Documents than would otherwise be imposed.

(iii) All payments by each  Borrower under the
Loan Documents shall be  made free and clear of,  and without
any deduction or  withholding for,  any Excess Tax.   If  any
Credit  Party or  any other  Person is  required by  any law,
rule, regulation,  order, directive, treaty  or guideline  to
make  any deduction or withholding on account of any Tax from
any Required Payment with respect to any Indemnified Tax Per-
son  and if all  or a portion  of such Tax  represents Excess
Tax:

(A)  such Credit  Party shall  notify the
Administrative Agent  and such Indemnified Tax  Person of any
such requirement  or any  change in  any such  requirement as
soon as such Credit Party becomes aware of it;

(B) such  Credit Party shall pay such Ex-
cess Tax before  the date on which  penalties attach thereto,
such  payment to be made (if  the liability to pay is imposed
on  such Credit  Party)  for  its  own  account  or  (if  the
liability  is  imposed on  such  Indemnified  Tax Person)  on
behalf of and in the name of such Indemnified Tax Person;

(C) such Credit Party  shall pay to  such
Indemnified Tax  Person an  additional amount such  that such
Indemnified Tax Person shall receive on the due date therefor
an amount equal to the Required Payment had no such deduction
or withholding been required with respect to such Excess Tax;
and

(D)  such Credit  Party shall,  within 30
days after paying such Excess Tax, deliver to the Administra-
tive  Agent   and  the  applicable  Indemnified   Tax  Person
satisfactory  evidence  of  such  payment  to  the   relevant
Governmental Authority.

(iv) If an Indemnified  Tax Person or any  af-
filiate thereof is required by any law, rule, regulation, or-
der, directive,  treaty or  guideline to pay  any Excess  Tax
(excluding   Excess  Tax   which   is   subject  to   Section
2.13(g)(iii))  with respect to any sum paid or payable by any
Credit  Party to such  Indemnified Tax Person  under the Loan
Documents:

(A) such Indemnified Tax Person shall no-
tify such Credit Party of any such payment of Excess Tax; and

(B) such  Credit Party shall  pay to such
Indemnified Tax Person the amount of such Excess Tax within 5
Business Days of such notice.<PAGE>





(v)  If any  amounts are  payable by  a Credit
Party  in   respect  of   Excess  Tax  pursuant   to  Section
2.13(g)(iii) or (iv) such  Credit Party agrees to pay  to the
applicable Indemnified  Tax Person, within 5  days of written
request  therefor, an amount equal to  all Taxes imposed with
respect  to such amounts as such Indemnified Tax Person shall
determine  are payable by such  Indemnified Tax Person or any
affiliate thereof in  respect of such amounts  and in respect
of any amounts  paid to or on behalf of  such Indemnified Tax
Person pursuant to this clause (v).

N. Increased Costs, Illegality, etc.

(a)  In the  event that any Lender  with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii) below or the Administrative Agent, the
Reference  Lender, or the applicable  Lender, as the case may
be, with respect to clauses (i) and (iv) below shall have de-
termined  (which determination shall,  absent manifest error,
be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto):

(i)  on  the  second Business  Day immediately
preceding  the making  of any  requested Eurodollar  Ad-
vance, Core Currency Euro Advance or Individual Currency
Loan  that, by reason  of any changes  arising after the
Effective Date affecting  the applicable interbank  mar-
ket, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertain-
ing the  applicable interest rate on  the basis provided
for in  the definition of the Eurodollar  Rate, the Core
Currency Euro  Rate or the Individual  Currency Rate, as
the case may be; or

(ii) at any time that such Lender has incurred
increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or
receivable  hereunder  with  respect to  any  Fixed Rate
Loan, in  each case by an amount such Lender deems to be
material, because of any change since the Effective Date
(or  in  the case  of any  Bid  Loan, subsequent  to ac-
ceptance by a Borrower of such Bid Loan, and in the case
of any Negotiated  Rate Loan, subsequent to  the date of
such Lender's execution of the Negotiated Rate Confirma-
tion for  such Negotiated Rate  Loan) in any  law, rule,
regulation, order or guideline applicable to such Lender
or  the  compliance  by  such Lender  with  any  request
(whether  or  not having  the  force  of law)  from  any
Governmental Authority made subsequent to  the Effective
Date  (or in  the case  of any  Bid Loan,  subsequent to
acceptance by a Borrower  of such Bid Loan, and,  in the
case of any Negotiated Rate Loan, subsequent to the date
of  such  Lender's  execution  of  the  Negotiated  Rate
Confirmation for  such Negotiated  Rate Loan) or  in the
interpretation or administration  thereof and  including
the  introduction  of  any new  law,  rule,  regulation,
order, guideline  or request, such as,  for example, but
not limited to: (A) a change in the basis of taxation of<PAGE>





payment to any Lender  of the  principal of  or interest
on  such Fixed  Rate Loan  or any other  amounts payable
hereunder  (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or
determined by reference  to, the  Tax on  the Income  of
such  Lender),  or  (B)  a change  in  official  reserve
(including any marginal,  emergency, supplemental,  spe-
cial  or other reserve)  or similar requirements (except
to the extent included in the computation of the respec-
tive Eurodollar Rate, the Core Currency Euro Rate, Swing
Line Negotiated Rate,  Negotiated Rate, Individual  Cur-
rency Rate or Bid Rate, as the case may be), or any spe-
cial deposit, assessment or similar  requirement against
assets  of,  deposits with  or  for the  account  of, or
credit extended by, any  Lender (or its Applicable Lend-
ing Office); or

(iii) at any time  that the making or continu-
ance of any Fixed  Rate Loan has been made  (x) unlawful
by any law, rule, regulation or order or (y)  impossible
by  compliance by any Lender in good faith with any gov-
ernmental  directive or request  (whether or  not having
the force of law); or

(iv) at any time that any Core Currency (other
than Dollars) or  any Non-Core Currency, as the case may
be, is  not available  in sufficient amounts,  as deter-
mined  in good faith by the Reference Lender in the case
of such  Core Currency, and by the  applicable Lender in
the  case of  such Non-Core  Currency, to fund  any bor-
rowing of Alternate Currency Loans in such Core Currency
or such Non-Core Currency, as the case may be;

then, and  in any such  event, such  Lender, in  the case  of
clause (ii) or  (iii) above, or the Administrative Agent, the
Reference Lender  or the applicable  Lender, as the  case may
be,  in the case of clause (i)  or (iv) above, shall promptly
give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Parent
(on behalf  of all Borrowers) and, except for the Administra-
tive Agent, to the Administrative Agent of such determination
(which notice the Administrative Agent  shall promptly trans-
mit to  each of  the other Lenders).   Thereafter (w)  in the
case  of clause (i) above,  (A) in the  event that Eurodollar
Advances, Core Currency Euro  Advances or Individual Currency
Loans  are so  affected,  Eurodollar Advances,  Core Currency
Euro  Advances or  Individual  Currency Loans  from such  ap-
plicable  Lender,  as the  case may  be,  shall no  longer be
available until  such time  as the Administrative  Agent, the
Reference Lender or  such applicable Lender, as  the case may
be,  notifies  the Parent  and the  Lenders that  the circum-
stances  giving rise  to  such notice  by the  Administrative
Agent, the Reference Lender or such applicable Lender, as the
case may be,  no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of  Conversion given by  any Borrower with  respect to
Eurodollar Advances,  Core Currency  Euro  Advances  or Indi-<PAGE>





vidual Currency  Loans to be made by  such applicable Lender,
as the case may be, which have not yet been incurred (includ-
ing  by way of conversion)  shall be deemed  rescinded by the
applicable Borrower and (B)  in the event that any  Core Cur-
rency  Euro Advance  or  Individual Currency  Loan is  so af-
fected, the interest rate for such Core Currency Euro Advance
or such Individual Currency  Loan, as the case may  be, shall
be determined on  the basis  provided in the  proviso to  the
definition of Core Currency  Euro Rate or Individual Currency
Rate,  as the  case may be,  (x) in  the case  of clause (ii)
above,  the applicable  Borrower  shall pay  to such  Lender,
within  3 days  of written  demand therefor,  such additional
amounts (in  the form of an increased rate of, or a different
method of  calculating, interest or otherwise  as such Lender
in its reasonable discretion shall determine) as shall be re-
quired to compensate  such Lender for such increased costs or
reductions  in amounts  received or  receivable hereunder  (a
written notice  as  to the  additional amounts  owed to  such
Lender, showing  the basis for the  calculation thereof, sub-
mitted  to such  applicable Borrower  by such Lender  in good
faith shall,  absent manifest error, be  final and conclusive
and binding  on all the  parties hereto), (y) in  the case of
clause (iii) above, the applicable Borrower shall take one of
the  actions specified in Section 2.14(b) and (z) in the case
of  clause (iv) above, Core Currency Euro Advances in the af-
fected Core  Currency or  Individual Currency Loans  from the
applicable Lender  in the affected Non-Core  Currency, as the
case may be, shall no longer be available until such  time as
the Reference Lender or  such applicable Lender, as the  case
may be, notifies the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers), the
Administrative Agent  and the Lenders that  the circumstances
giving  rise to the notice referred to above by the Reference
Lender or such applicable Lender, as the case may  be, to the
Parent (on  behalf of  all Borrowers) and  the Administrative
Agent  no longer exists, and any Notice of Borrowing given by
the affected Borrower with respect to such Core Currency Euro
Advances or  such Individual Currency Loans, as  the case may
be,  which have  not yet  been incurred  shall be  deemed re-
scinded by such  affected Borrower.  Each  of the Administra-
tive Agent, the Reference  Lender and the Lenders  agree that
if it gives  notice to any Borrower of any  of the events de-
scribed in clause (i), (iii) or (iv) above, it shall promptly
notify  the Parent (on behalf  of all Borrowers)  and, in the
case  of any such Lender and the Reference Lender, the Admin-
istrative Agent, if such event ceases to exist.  If any  such
event described  in clause (iii) above with  respect to Euro-
dollar Advances, Core  Currency Euro  Advances or  Individual
Currency  Loans ceases to exist  as to a  Lender, the obliga-
tions of such Lender, as the case may  be, to make Eurodollar
Advances, Core Currency Euro  Advances or Individual Currency
Loans and  to convert  Eurodollar Advances to  new Eurodollar
Advances  or convert Core Currency Euro Advances  to new Core
Currency Euro Advances on  the terms and conditions contained
herein shall be reinstated.<PAGE>





(b)  At any time  that any Fixed  Rate Loan is  af-
fected by the circumstances described in Section  2.14(a)(ii)
or (iii), the applicable  Borrower may (and in the case of an
affected Fixed  Rate Loan  by the circumstances  described in
Section 2.14(a)(iii) shall) either  (x) if the affected Fixed
Rate Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to  a con-
version, cancel  the  respective borrowing  or conversion  by
giving the Administrative  Agent telephonic notice (confirmed
in writing) on the same date  that the Parent was notified by
the affected  Lender or the Administrative  Agent pursuant to
Section  2.14(a)(ii) or  (iii) or  (y) if the  affected Fixed
Rate Loan is  then outstanding, upon at  least three Business
Days' written notice to the Administrative  Agent and the af-
fected Lender, (A) in  the case of a Eurodollar  Advance, re-
quire the affected Lender  to convert such Eurodollar Advance
into an ABR Advance as of the end of the Interest Period then
applicable to such Eurodollar Advance or, if earlier, as soon
as practicable within the time required by law and (B) in the
case of  a Core Currency Euro Advance,  Swing Line Negotiated
Rate Advance,  Negotiated Rate Loan, Individual Currency Loan
or Bid Loan, take such action as the affected Lender may rea-
sonably request with a view to  minimizing the obligations of
such Borrower under Section 2.15.

(c)  If any Lender determines that after the Effec-
tive Date the introduction of or any change in any applicable
law, rule, regulation, order, guideline, directive or compli-
ance  by  such Lender  or  any  corporation controlling  such
Lender with any request  (whether or not having the  force of
law)  from  any  Governmental  Authority  concerning  capital
adequacy, or  any change in interpretation  or administration
thereof  by any  Governmental  Authority, in  each case  made
subsequent  to  the date  hereof,  will  have  the effect  of
reducing the rate  of return  on the capital  required to  be
maintained by such Lender or any corporation controlling such
Lender based on the existence of such  Lender's Commitment or
Individual  Currency Commitments hereunder or its obligations
under the Loan  Documents to  a level below  that which  such
Lender or such  corporation could have achieved  but for such
application or compliance (taking into  account such Lender's
or such  corporation's policies  with respect to  capital ad-
equacy)  by an amount deemed  by such Lender  to be material,
then each of the Borrowers to the extent of its Proportionate
Share and the  Parent severally  agrees to pay  such to  such
Lender,  within  3  Business   Days  of  its  written  demand
therefor,  such additional  amounts as  shall be  required to
compensate such  Lender or such other corporation for the in-
creased  cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the
reduction in the rate of return to such  Lender or such other
corporation as a result  of such reduction.  In   determining
such additional amounts, each  Lender will act reasonably and
in good faith  and will use averaging and attribution methods
which  are reasonable, provided that such Lender's reasonable
good  faith  determination of  compensation owing  under this<PAGE>





Section 2.14(c)  shall, absent  manifest error, be  final and
conclusive  and binding  on  all the  parties  hereto.   Each
Lender, upon determining that  any additional amounts will be
payable pursuant  to this  Section 2.14(c), will  give prompt
written notice thereof to  the Parent (on behalf of  all Bor-
rowers), which notice shall show the basis for calculation of
such additional amounts.

(d)  Each Lender shall notify the Parent (on behalf
of all Borrowers) of any event occurring after the  Effective
Date entitling such Lender to compensation under this Section
2.14  as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 120
days after the officer having primary responsibility for this
Agreement obtains actual knowledge thereof, provided  that no
such notice shall  be required if such Lender  has determined
not  to seek compensation under this Section 2.14 as a result
of such  event.  Each Lender will  furnish to each Borrower a
certificate  setting forth the  basis and amount  of each re-
quest  by such  Lender  for compensation  under this  Section
2.14.   Determinations and allocations by any Lender for pur-
poses of  this Section 2.14 on its costs or rate of return of
maintaining  Loans  or its  obligation to  make Loans,  or on
amounts  receivable  by  it in respect  of Loans, and  of the
amounts required to compensate such Lender under this Section
2.14 shall be prima facie evidence of such determinations and
allocations.

(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall
be entitled to any compensation described in Section 2.14 un-
less,  at the time it  requests such compensation,  it is the
policy or general practice of such  Lender to request compen-
sation  for comparable  costs in similar  circumstances under
comparable provisions of  other credit agreements for  compa-
rable customers  unless specific  facts or circumstances  ap-
plicable to any Borrower  or the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents would alter  such policy or general  prac-
tice,  provided that  nothing in  this Section  2.14(e) shall
preclude  a Lender  from  waiving the  collection of  similar
costs from one or more of its other customers.

(f)  If  any Lender  fails to  give the  notice de-
scribed  in Section 2.14(d)  within 90 days  after it obtains
such  actual knowledge of the  event required to be described
in such notice, such  Lender shall, with respect to  any com-
pensation that would otherwise be owing to  such Lender under
this Section 2.14, only be entitled to payment for  increased
costs  incurred from and after the date that such Lender does
give such notice.

O. Compensation

Each  Borrower shall compensate each Lender, within
3 days of its written demand therefor (which demand shall set
forth the  basis for  requesting such compensation),  for all<PAGE>





reasonable  losses, expenses  and liabilities,  including any
loss, expense  or liability (including those  related to cur-
rency exchange) incurred by reason  of the liquidation or re-
employment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender
to  fund its Fixed  Rate Loans but excluding  any loss of an-
ticipated  profit which such  Lender may sustain:  (i) if for
any  reason, a  borrowing of,  or conversion  from or  into a
Fixed Rate Loan does  not occur on a date  specified therefor
in a Notice of  Borrowing, a Notice of Conversion,  a Negoti-
ated  Rate Confirmation or a Bid accepted by a Borrower; (ii)
if any  repayment (including  any repayment made  pursuant to
Section 2.10 or  as a result of an  acceleration of the Loans
pursuant  to  Section  9)  or  conversion   of  any  of  such
Borrower's Fixed Rate Loans occurs on a date which is not the
last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto; (iii) if
any  prepayment of any of such Borrower's Fixed Rate Loans is
not  made on  any date  specified in  a notice  of prepayment
given by such Borrower;  or (iv) as a consequence  of (x) any
other  default by such Borrower  to repay its  Loans when re-
quired by the  terms of  this Agreement or  (y) any  election
made pursuant to Section 2.14(b) or 11.1(b).

P. Change  of Applicable Lending  Office and  Applicable
Payment Office

(a)  With respect to any Loan  of any Lender or any
Letter of Credit, such Lender  agrees that on the  occurrence
of  any event giving rise  to the operation  of Section 2.13,
Section  2.14(a)(ii)  or   (iii),  Section  2.14(c),  Section
2.14(d) or Section  2.22 with  respect to such  Loan or  such
Letter of Credit,  it will,  if requested  by the  applicable
Borrower, use reasonable  efforts (subject to  overall policy
considerations  of  such  Lender)  to designate  another  Ap-
plicable Lending Office or  Applicable Payment Office, as the
case may  be, for such Loan or such Letter of Credit affected
by such event, provided that such designation is made on such
terms that  such Lender and its Applicable  Lending Office or
Applicable Payment Office, as the case may be, suffer no eco-
nomic, legal  or regulatory disadvantage, with  the object of
avoiding  the consequence of the event giving rise to the op-
eration of such Section.   Nothing in this Section  shall af-
fect  or postpone any of  the obligations of  any Borrower or
the right of any Lender provided in Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15
and 2.22.

(b)  Each Lender  shall have the right  at any time
and from time to time to transfer any of its Loans to a  dif-
ferent office,  provided that such Lender  shall promptly no-
tify  the Administrative  Agent and the Parent (on  behalf of
all Borrowers) of  any such  change of office.   Such  office
shall thereupon  become such Lender's  Applicable Lending Of-
fice for  such Loan  provided, however,  that no such  Lender
shall be entitled to receive any greater amount under Section
2.13, Section  2.14(a)(ii) or (iii), Section  2.14(c) or Sec-<PAGE>





tion 2.22 as a  result of a transfer  of any such Loans to  a
different  office of such Lender than it would be entitled to
immediately prior thereto unless such claim would have arisen
even if such transfer had not occurred.

Q. Survival of Certain Obligations

The  obligations of  the  Borrowers under  Sections
2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.22, 11.5 and 11.10 shall survive the ter-
mination of the Aggregate Commitments, the Swing Line Commit-
ment,  the  Individual Currency  Commitments,  the Letter  of
Credit Commitment the payment of the Loans, the reimbursement
obligations in respect of the Letters of Credit and all other
amounts payable under the Loan Documents.

R. Use of Proceeds

The  proceeds of the  Loans shall be  used to refi-
nance the Indebtedness set forth on Schedule 5.8 and for gen-
eral corporate  purposes of the Parent  and its Subsidiaries.
The uses to  which the proceeds  of the  Loans are put  shall
conform with the provisions of Section 4.11.

S. Letter of Credit Sub-Facility

(a)  Subject to the  terms and  conditions of  this
Agreement, the Issuing Bank agrees, in reliance on the agree-
ment of the other Lenders set forth in Section 2.20, to issue
standby letters of credit in Core Currencies (the "Letters of
Credit"; each a "Letter of Credit") during the Commitment Pe-
riod  for the account of one or  more of the Letter of Credit
Applicants, provided,  however, that,  at the request  of any
Letter of Credit Applicant, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole
discretion, issue one or  more Letters of Credit for  the ac-
count of  such Letter of Credit Applicant in one or more Non-
Core  Currencies.  The Letter  of Credit Exposure  at any one
time  outstanding  shall not  exceed  the lesser  of  (i) the
amount  of  the  Letter of  Credit  Commitment  and  (ii) the
excess,  if any, of the sum of the Aggregate Commitments over
the sum of the aggregate outstanding  principal amount of all
Loans  (determined on the basis of  the Dollar Equivalent for
each  outstanding Alternate  Currency Loan).   The  Letter of
Credit Exposure  at any one time  outstanding attributable to
all Letters of Credit issued in Non-Core Currencies shall not
exceed the  excess, if any, of $60,000,000 over the Aggregate
Credit  Exposure  at  such  time attributable  to  all  Loans
designated in  Non-Core Currencies.  The sum of the aggregate
principal  amount of  the  Individual Currency  Loans of  all
Lenders at any one time outstanding  in any Non-Core Currency
and  the Letter of Credit Exposure  at such time attributable
to all  Letters of  Credit issued in  such Non-Core  Currency
(determined on  the basis  of the  Dollar Equivalent of  each
such Individual Currency Loan and each such Letter of Credit)
shall  not exceed $5,000,000.   Each  Letter of  Credit shall<PAGE>





have an expiration date which shall not exceed the earlier of
(x) twelve months from  the date of issuance thereof  and (y)
30 days immediately  preceding the Maturity Date.   No Letter
of Credit shall be issued, and  no amendment to any Letter of
Credit shall be issued which would increase the stated amount
or extend the expiration  date of such Letter of  Credit, (i)
if  the Administrative Agent or  any Lender by  notice to the
Administrative Agent and the  applicable Letter of Credit Ap-
plicant and the Parent  no later than 1:00 P.M.  one Business
Day prior to the requested date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit or  amendment, shall have  determined that any  of the
applicable  conditions set forth in Sections 5 and 6 have not
been satisfied  and such conditions remain  unsatisfied as of
the requested  time  of  issuing  such Letter  of  Credit  or
amendment or (ii) to the extent that immediately after giving
effect thereto the Aggregate Credit Exposure would exceed the
Aggregate Commitments (each a "Non-Issuance Event").

(b)  Each Letter of Credit  shall be issued for the
account of the applicable Letter of Credit Applicant for gen-
eral corporate  purposes of  such Letter of  Credit Applicant
and its Subsidiaries.   Such Letter  of Credit Applicant  and
the Parent  shall give the  Administrative Agent a  Letter of
Credit Request for the  issuance of such Letter of  Credit by
11:00 A.M. three Business Days prior to the requested date of
issuance.  Such Letter of Credit Request shall be executed by
such  Letter of Credit  Applicant and  the Parent,  and shall
specify  (i) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit and the
obligations  of such Letter of Credit Applicant or any of its
Subsidiaries,  as the case may  be, in respect  of which such
Letter of Credit is to be  issued, (ii) such Letter of Credit
Applicant's proposal as to the conditions under which a draw-
ing may be made under such Letter of Credit  and the documen-
tation  to be required in  respect thereof, (iii) the maximum
amount  to be available under such Letter of Credit, (iv) the
requested date  of issuance and (v)  the applicable Currency.
Upon  receipt of such Letter of Credit Request from such Let-
ter of  Credit Applicant  and the Parent,  the Administrative
Agent shall promptly  notify the Issuing Bank  and each other
Lender thereof.  Each  Letter of Credit shall be  in form and
substance reasonably  satisfactory to  the Issuing Bank,  and
adequate and fair means in the sole discretion of the Issuing
Bank  shall  exist for the issuance thereof, with such provi-
sions with  respect to the  conditions under which  a drawing
may be made thereunder and the documentation  required in re-
spect of such  drawing as the  Issuing Bank shall  reasonably
require and as  may be  acceptable to such  Letter of  Credit
Applicant and the  Parent.   Such Letter of  Credit shall  be
used solely  for the  purposes described therein  and herein.
The  Issuing Bank shall, on the proposed date of issuance and
subject  to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
issue such Letter of Credit.

(c)  Each payment  by the  Issuing Bank of  a draft<PAGE>





drawn  under a Letter of Credit designated in a Core Currency
shall  give rise  to an  obligation on  the  part of  the ap-
plicable Letter of Credit  Applicant to reimburse the Issuing
Bank  immediately for  the amount  thereof at  its Applicable
Payment Office in such Core Currency.

(d)  Each payment  by the  Issuing Bank of  a draft
drawn  under a Letter of Credit designated in a Non-Core Cur-
rency shall give rise to an obligation on the part of the ap-
plicable Letter of Credit  Applicant to reimburse the Issuing
Bank immediately for the  amount thereof in Dollars, at  such
office as the Issuing Bank shall designate to the Administra-
tive Agent, the Parent  and such Letter of  Credit Applicant,
in  an amount based upon the all-in  cost of funds in Dollars
of the Issuing Bank to fund  such draft (each a "Dollar Reim-
bursement Amount").   In connection with each obligation of a
Letter  of Credit  Applicant  to pay  a Dollar  Reimbursement
Amount  under this  Section 2.19(d),  the Issuing  Bank shall
deliver to such  Letter of Credit  Applicant, the Parent  and
the Administrative  Agent a  written statement setting  forth
such  Dollar  Reimbursement  Amount.    The   Issuing  Bank's
determination of  such Dollar  Reimbursement Amount  shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

T.  Letter of  Credit Participation and  Funding Commit-
ments

(a)  Each  Lender  hereby  unconditionally and  ir-
revocably, severally  for itself only and  without any notice
to or  the taking  of any action  by such Lender,  takes from
time  to  time an  undivided  participating  interest in  the
obligations of the Issuing Bank under and in  connection with
each Letter of  Credit in  an amount equal  to such  Lender's
Availability Percentage at  such time of  the amount of  such
Letter  of Credit.   Each Lender  from time to  time shall be
liable to  the Issuing  Bank for its  Availability Percentage
at  such time of the  unreimbursed amount of  any draft drawn
and  honored under each Letter  of Credit.   Each Lender from
time to  time shall also be liable for an amount equal to the
product of its Availability  Percentage at such time  and any
amounts paid  by the applicable   Letter of  Credit Applicant
pursuant to  Section 2.21 that are  subsequently rescinded or
avoided, or must otherwise be restored or returned.  Such li-
abilities shall  be unconditional  and without regard  to the
occurrence  of any Default or Event of Default or the compli-
ance  by the  Parent  and the  Borrowers  with any  of  their
respective obligations under the  Loan Documents or any other
circumstances.

(b)  The Administrative Agent will  promptly notify
each  Lender (which  notice  shall be  promptly confirmed  in
writing)  of the date and  the amount of  any draft presented
under any Letter of  Credit with respect to which  full reim-
bursement  of payment is not made by the applicable Letter of<PAGE>





Credit Applicant as provided  in Sections 2.19(c) or 2.19(d),
as the  case may be, and  forthwith upon receipt  of such no-
tice,  and provided  that  no Non-Issuance  Event shall  have
occurred and be  continuing with  respect to  such Letter  of
Credit,  such Lender  (other  than the  Issuing  Bank in  its
capacity   as  a   Lender)  shall   make  available   to  the
Administrative Agent for  the account of the Issuing Bank its
Availability Percentage  at such time  of the amount  of such
unreimbursed draft or, if such Letter of Credit is designated
in a  Non-Core Currency, the applicable  Dollar Reimbursement
Amount, at  the Applicable Payment Office  of the Administra-
tive Agent in the applicable Core Currency or, if such Letter
of  Credit  is  designated in  a  Non-Core  Currency, at  the
applicable  office  designated  by the  Administrative  Agent
pursuant to Section 2.19(d) in Dollars, and, in each case, in
immediately available funds.  The Administrative Agent  shall
distribute the payments  made by each Lender  (other than the
Issuing Bank in  its capacity  as a Lender)  pursuant to  the
immediately preceding sentence  to the Issuing Bank  promptly
upon  receipt thereof in like funds as received.  Each Lender
shall  indemnify and hold  harmless the  Administrative Agent
and the Issuing Bank from and against any and all losses, li-
abilities  (including  liabilities  for penalties),  actions,
suits, judgments, demands, costs and expenses (including rea-
sonable  attorneys'  fees and  expenses)  resulting from  any
failure on  the part of such  Lender to provide, or  from any
delay  in  providing,  the  Administrative  Agent  with  such
Lender's Availability Percentage of the amount of any payment
made  by the  Issuing Bank  under a Letter  of Credit  in ac-
cordance with  this clause  (b) above  (except in  respect of
losses, liabilities or other  obligations suffered by the Is-
suing  Bank resulting  from the  gross negligence  or willful
misconduct of  the Issuing Bank or  the Administrative Agent,
as the case may be).  If a Lender does not make available  to
the Administrative Agent when due such  Lender's Availability
Percentage at such time of  any unreimbursed payment made  by
the  Issuing Bank under a  Letter of Credit  (other than pay-
ments made by the Issuing Bank by reason  of its gross negli-
gence or  willful misconduct),  such Lender shall be required
to pay interest to  the Administrative Agent for  the account
of the Issuing Bank  on such Lender's Availability Percentage
at such  time of such payment at a rate of interest per annum
equal  to  the Federal  Funds Rate  (or, in  the case  of any
Letter of  Credit designated in  a Core Currency  (other than
Dollars), at a  rate based upon the all-in  cost of funds for
the applicable Non-Core Currency) from the date such Lender's
payment is due until the date such payment is received by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall distrib-
ute such interest payments  to the Issuing Bank  upon receipt
thereof in like funds as received.

(c)  Whenever the Administrative Agent or the Issu-
ing Bank is reimbursed by any Letter of Credit Applicant, for
the account of the Issuing Bank, for any payment under a Let-<PAGE>





ter  of Credit and such  payment relates to  an amount previ-
ously  paid by a Lender  in respect of  its Availability Per-
centage  of the amount of  such payment under  such Letter of
Credit, the Administrative Agent or the  Issuing Bank, as the
case  may be,  will promptly  pay over  such payment  to such
Lender.

U. Absolute Obligation with  respect to Letter of Credit
Payments

The obligation of  each Letter of  Credit Applicant
to reimburse the Administrative Agent  for the account of the
Issuing Bank in respect  of each Letter of Credit  issued for
the  account of such Letter of Credit Applicant for each pay-
ment under  or in respect of  such Letter of Credit  shall be
absolute and  unconditional under any  and all  circumstances
and irrespective  of any set-off, counterclaim  or defense to
payment which such Letter  of Credit Applicant or any  of its
Subsidiaries may have or have had against the beneficiary  of
such Letter of Credit,  the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank, as issuer  of such  Letter of Credit,  any Lender,  the
Swing Line Lender or any other  Person, including any defense
based on the  failure of any drawing to  conform to the terms
of  such Letter of Credit, any drawing document proving to be
forged, fraudulent  or invalid,  or  the legality,  validity,
regularity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit.

V. Increased Costs Based on Letters of Credit

Without limiting the provisions of Section 2.14, if
any law, rule, regulation, order, guideline or request or any
change in  the interpretation  or application thereof  by any
Governmental  Authority  charged   with  the   administration
thereof or GAAP shall  either (a) impose, modify or  make ap-
plicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment  or similar
requirement against  any Letter of Credit  issued or partici-
pated in by any  Lender, or (b) impose on  the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing  Bank or  such Lender, as the case may be,
any other  condition regarding such Letter  of Credit (except
for imposition of, or changes in the rate of, the  Tax on the
Income of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank  or such
Lender, as the case may  be) and the result of any  event re-
ferred to in clause (a) or (b) above shall be to increase the
cost  to the Issuing Bank (or any successor thereto as issuer
of such Letter of Credit) of issuing or maintaining such Let-
ter of  Credit or the cost  to any Lender  of its obligations
pursuant to Section 2.20,  or the cost to the  Administrative
Agent of  performing its functions hereunder  with respect to
such  Letter of Credit,  in any case  by an  amount which the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the
case  may be, deems material, then, upon demand by the Admin-
istrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case
may be, the  applicable Letter of Credit  Applicant shall im-
mediately pay  to the Administrative Agent,  the Issuing Bank<PAGE>





or  such Lender,  as the case  may be,  from time  to time as
specified by  the Administrative  Agent, the Issuing  Bank or
such Lender,  as the  case may  be, additional  amounts which
shall be sufficient  to compensate the  Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, for such
increased  cost.  A statement in reasonable detail as to such
increased cost incurred by  the Administrative Agent, the Is-
suing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, as a result of
any event mentioned in clauses (a) or (b) above, submitted by
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as
the case may be, to such Letter of Credit  Applicant shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error, as to the amount thereof.

W. Borrower Addenda

Provided that  no Default  or Event of  Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Parent may direct that any of
its wholly-owned  Subsidiaries which  is not then  a Borrower
become a Borrower  by submitting a  Borrower Addendum to  the
Administrative Agent with respect to such Subsidiary duly ex-
ecuted by  each of  the Parent  and such  Subsidiary together
with a certificate, dated the date  of such Borrower Addendum
of the  Secretary or  Assistant Secretary of  such Subsidiary
(i)  attaching a true and complete copy of the resolutions of
its Board of  Directors and of all documents evidencing other
necessary corporate action  (in form and substance  satisfac-
tory  to the Administrative  Agent) taken by  it to authorize
such Borrower  Addendum, the Loan Documents  and the transac-
tions contemplated  thereby, (ii)  attaching a true  and com-
plete copy  of its  certificate of incorporation,  by-laws or
other organizational  documents, (iii) setting forth  the in-
cumbency  of  its   officer  or  officers  who  may sign  the
Borrower Addendum, including therein a  signature specimen of
such officer or  officers, (iv) an  opinion of foreign  local
counsel  to  such  Subsidiary  in  all   respects  reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative  Agent and (v) attaching a
certificate of  good standing  (or equivalent) issued  by the
jurisdiction of  its incorporation.  If any such  document is
not  in English,  such  document shall  be  accompanied by  a
certified  English translation  thereof.   Upon receipt  of a
Borrower Addendum  and the supporting  documentation referred
to above,  the Administrative  Agent shall confirm  such Bor-
rower  Addendum by signing a copy thereof and shall deliver a
copy  thereof to the Parent  and each Lender.   Thereupon the
Subsidiary which executed such Borrower Addendum shall become
a "Borrower" hereunder.   In the  event that such  additional
Borrower is not a  corporation organized under the laws  of a
jurisdiction in  which any  other Borrower is  organized (and
whose principal office  is not located  in a jurisdiction  in
which any other Borrower's principal office is located), this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents will be deemed amended
by  adding  definitions  comparable to  the  definitions  ap-
plicable  to each other Subsidiary Borrower, such definitions
to be as set forth in the applicable Borrower Addendum.<PAGE>





X. Records

(a)  Lender's Records. Each Lender will note on its
internal records with respect to each Loan made by it (i) the
date and amount of such Loan, (ii) whether such Loan is a Re-
volving Loan, Swing Line  Loan, Individual Currency Loan, Ne-
gotiated Rate Loan  or Bid  Loan, (iii) the  identity of  the
Borrower to whom such  Loan was made, (iv) the  interest rate
(other than in the  case of an ABR Advance),  Individual Cur-
rency Rate, Negotiated Rate or Bid Rate and Interest  Period,
if applicable, applicable to  such Loan and (v) each  payment
and prepayment of the principal thereof.

(b)  Administrative  Agent's Records.  The Adminis-
trative  Agent shall  keep records  regarding the  Loans, the
Letters  of Credit and this  Agreement in accordance with its
customary procedures for agented credits.

(c)  Prima Facie Evidence. The entries  made in the
records maintained pursuant to  subsections (a) and (b) above
shall, to  the extent  not prohibited  by applicable  law, be
prima facie evidence of the existence and amount of the obli-
gations  of the  Parent and  each Borrower  recorded therein;
provided,  however, that  the failure  of the  Administrative
Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, to make any notation
on its records shall  not affect the Parent's or  the respec-
tive Borrower's obligations in respect of the Loans, the Let-
ters of Credit or the Loan Documents.

Y. Replacement of Lender

If  (i) any  Borrower  is obligated  to pay  to any
Lender  any amount under Section 2.13(a), (b) or (c) and such
payment is attributable solely to any change since the Effec-
tive Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature
pages hereof) or since the  effective date of the  Assignment
and Acceptance Agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender
(in the case  of each  other Lender) in  any applicable  law,
rule,  regulation,  order,  directive,  treaty  or  guideline
(whether   or  not  having  the  force  of  law)  or  in  the

introduction  of  any  new  law,  rule,   regulation,  order,
directive, treaty  or guideline), (ii) any  Lender shall have
failed to make  available a Loan on the date  on which and in
the amount in which it  was obligated to do so and  shall not

of  Default shall  exist to  replace up  to two  such Lenders
(each  a "Replaced Lender") with  one or more other assignees
(each,  a "Replacement Lender"), reasonably acceptable to the
Swing  Line Lender and the Issuing Bank, provided that (I) at<PAGE>

funded  by (and not reimbursed to)  such Replaced Lender, to-
gether  with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at
such  time  and  (C) an  amount  equal  to  all accrued,  but
theretofore  unpaid,  fees  owing   to  the  Replaced  Lender

equal to such Replaced  Lender's Commitment Percentage of any
Mandatory  Borrowing  to  the  extent  such  amount  was  not
theretofore  funded  by  such  Replaced Lender  and  (z)  the

such Replaced  Lender to the Administrative  Agent under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, an amount  equal to

outstanding  Loans of  the  Replaced Lender,  a corresponding
amount  of which  was  made available  by the  Administrative
Agent to  the  applicable  Borrower(s)  pursuant  to  Section
2.4(e)  and which has  not been repaid  to the Administrative
Agent by  such Replaced Lender or  the applicable Borrower(s)
and  (II)  all obligations  of  the  Borrowers owing  to  the
Replaced Lender  (other than those specifically  described in
clause (I) above in respect of which the assignment  purchase
price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid
in full  to such Replaced  Lender concurrently with  such re-
placement.   Upon the execution of  the respective Assignment
and Acceptance Agreements and the payment of amounts referred
to in  clauses (i)  and (ii)  of this  Section 2.25,  the Re-
placement Lender shall  become a Lender hereunder and the Re-

In  order to  induce  the Administrative  Agent and  the
Lenders to enter into  this Agreement and to make  the Loans,
the Swing Line  Lender to make the  Swing Line Loans and  the
Lenders   to  participate therein,  and  the Issuing  Bank to
issue the Letters  of Credit and  the Lenders to  participate
therein,  the Parent  and  the Borrowers  make the  following
representations  and warranties to  the Administrative Agent,
the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders:

A.    Subsidiaries; Capital Stock

As  of the date of this  Agreement, the Parent has
only  the  Subsidiaries set  forth  on,  and the  authorized,
issued  and outstanding capital stock  of the Parent and each
such Subsidiary  (or partnership  or other interests,  as the
case may  be) is as set  forth on, Schedule 4.1.   The shares
of, or partnership or other interests in, each Subsidiary  of
the Parent are owned beneficially and of record by the Parent
or  another Subsidiary of the  Parent, are free  and clear of
all Liens except as  otherwise permitted by Section  8.3, and
are  duly   authorized,  validly   issued,  fully   paid  and
nonassessable except, in the case of any Subsidiary organized
under the laws  of the State of  New York, for  any liability
that may arise  under the  provisions of Section  630 of  the
Business Corporation Law of the State of New York.  As of the<PAGE>





date  of this Agreement, except as set forth on Schedule 4.1,
(a) neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has issued
any securities convertible into,  or options or warrants for,
any common or preferred  equity securities thereof, (b) there
are no agreements,  voting trusts  or understandings  binding
upon  the Parent or any  of its Subsidiaries  with respect to
the  voting  securities   of  the  Parent   or  any  of   its
Subsidiaries or affecting in any manner the sale, pledge, as-
signment or other disposition thereof, including any right of
first refusal,  option, redemption, call or  other right with
respect thereto,  whether similar or dissimilar to any of the
foregoing, and  (c) the Parent owns,  directly or indirectly,
all  of  the  outstanding  capital  stock   of  each  of  its
Subsidiaries.

B.    Existence and Power

Each of the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is
duly organized,  validly existing and in  good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, has all requi-
site power and authority to own its  Property and to carry on
its  business as now conducted,  and is in  good standing and
authorized  to do business in each  jurisdiction in which the
failure  so to qualify could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse effect.

C.    Authority

Each of  the Parent  and each of  its Subsidiaries
has full power and authority  to enter into, execute, deliver
and perform the terms of the Loan Documents to which  it is a
party, all of which  have been duly authorized by  all proper
and necessary  corporate or  partnership action, as  the case
may  be, and are in  full compliance with  its certificate of
incorporation  and by-laws or  partnership agreement,  as the
case may  be.  No consent or approval of, or other action by,
shareholders of  the Parent, any  Borrower, any  Governmental
Authority  or any  other Person,  which has not  already been
obtained, is required  to authorize in respect  of the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, or is required in connection with
the  execution, delivery  and performance  by the  Parent and
each of its Subsidiaries  of, the Loan Documents to  which it
is a party,  or is required  as a  condition to the  enforce-
ability against  the Parent  or such  Subsidiary of  the Loan
Documents to which it is a party.

D.    Binding Agreement

The   Loan  Documents  constitute  the  valid  and
legally binding  obligations of the  Parent and  each of  its
Subsidiaries  to the extent the Parent or such Subsidiary, as
the  case  may be,  is a  party  thereto, enforceable  in ac-
cordance with their respective terms, except as such enforce-
ability may be limited by  applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,<PAGE>





reorganization, moratorium or similar  laws affecting the en-
forcement  of creditors'  rights  generally and  by equitable
principles  relating to  the  availability  of specific  per-
formance  as  a  remedy   and  except  to  the   extent  that
indemnification  obligations  may be  limited  by  federal or
state securities laws or public policy relating thereto.

E.    Litigation

Except as set forth on Schedule 4.5, there are  no
actions,  suits, arbitration  proceedings or  claims (whether
purportedly on behalf of the  Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
or  otherwise) pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent and
the Borrowers,  threatened against the  Parent or any  of its
Subsidiaries,  or maintained by the Parent or any of its Sub-
sidiaries,  or which may affect the Property of the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, before any Gov-
ernmental Authority  which could  reasonably  be expected  to
have  a Material  Adverse effect.   There are  no proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent and the Borrowers,
threatened against the Parent or  any of its Subsidiaries (a)
which call  into question the validity  or enforceability of,
or otherwise  seek to invalidate  any Loan  Document, or  (b)
which might, individually or in the aggregate, materially and
adversely affect any of  the transactions contemplated by any
Loan Document.

F.    No Conflicting Agreements

(a) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
is  in default under any agreement to  which it is a party or
by which  it or any  of its Property  is bound the  effect of
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
effect.    No notice  to,  or filing  with,  any Governmental
Authority  is required  for the  due execution,  delivery and
performance by the Parent  or any of its Subsidiaries  of the
Loan Documents to which  it is a party (except  those notices
or filings which have already been made).

(b) No provision of any statute, rule, regulation,
judgment, decree or order, or any existing material mortgage,
indenture, contract or agreement, in each case binding on the
Parent  or any of its  Subsidiaries or affecting the Property
of the Parent or  any of its Subsidiaries conflicts  with, or
requires  any consent  which  has not  already been  obtained
under, or  would in any way prohibit  the execution, delivery
or  performance by the Parent  or any of  its Subsidiaries of
the  terms of, any Loan Document.  The execution, delivery or
performance by the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries of the
terms of each  Loan Document to which it is  a party will not
constitute  a default  under, or  result  in the  creation or
imposition of,  or obligation  to create,  any Lien upon  the
Property of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
the  terms  of  any  such mortgage,  indenture,  contract  or<PAGE>





agreement  which defaults  or Liens,  individually or  in the
aggregate, would have or result in a Material Adverse effect.

G.    Taxes

The Parent and each  of its Subsidiaries has filed
or  caused to be filed all tax  returns, and has paid, or has
made adequate provision  for the payment of,  all taxes shown
to be due  and payable on said returns or  in any assessments
made against them, the failure of which  to file or pay could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, and
no tax Liens have been filed against the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and no claims are being asserted with respect to
such taxes which are  required by GAAP (as  in effect on  the
Effective Date)  to be reflected in  the Financial Statements
and  are not so reflected therein.  The charges, accruals and
reserves  on  the  books  of  the  Parent  and  each  of  its
Subsidiaries with  respect  to  all  Federal,  state,  local,
foreign and  other taxes are considered by  the management of
the  Parent and the Borrowers to be adequate, and neither the
Parent nor any Borrower knows  of any unpaid assessment which
is  or might  be due  and payable  against it  or any  of its
Subsidiaries  or any  Property of  the Parent  or any  of its
Subsidiaries,  except such  thereof as are being contested in
good   faith  and   by  appropriate   proceedings  diligently
conducted,  and for  which  adequate reserves  have been  set
aside in accordance with GAAP.

H.    Compliance with Applicable Laws; Filings

Neither the Parent nor  any of its Subsidiaries is
in default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunc-
tion, decree or decision  of any Governmental Authority which
default  could reasonably be expected  to have a Material Ad-
verse effect.   The Parent  and each of  its Subsidiaries  is
complying with all applicable statutes, rules and regulations
of all  Governmental Authorities, a violation  of which could
reasonably  be expected  to have  a Material  Adverse effect.
The Parent and each  of its Subsidiaries has filed  or caused
to be  filed with  all Governmental Authorities  all reports,
applications, documents, instruments and information required
to be filed  pursuant to all applicable laws,  rules, regula-
tions  and requests which, if  not so filed, could reasonably
be  expected  to  have  a  Material  Adverse  effect.    Each
Borrower, prior  to  each borrowing  by it  hereunder in  any
jurisdiction,   has  obtained  all  necessary  approvals  and
consents of, and has filed or caused to be filed all reports,
applications, documents, instruments and information required
to  be   filed  pursuant  to  all   applicable  laws,  rules,
regulations and requests of,  all Governmental Authorities in
connection with such borrowing in such jurisdiction.

I.    Governmental Regulations<PAGE>





Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any corporation  controlling the Parent or any of its Subsid-
iaries or under common  control with the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to  regulation under the Public Util-
ity Holding Company Act  of 1935, the Federal Power  Act, the
Investment Company Act of  1940, in each case as  amended, or
is  subject to any statute  or regulation which regulates the
incurrence of Indebtedness, including statutes or regulations
relative to common  or contract  carriers or to  the sale  of
electricity, gas, steam, water, telephone, telegraph or other
public utility services.

J.    Property

Each of  the Parent  and each of  its Subsidiaries
has good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold inter-
est in, all of its real Property, and is the owner of, or has
a valid lease of,  all personal property, in each  case which
is material to  the Parent  and its Subsidiaries  taken as  a
whole, subject  to no Liens,  except such Liens  permitted by
Section 8.3.   All leases of Property  to each of the  Parent
and  each of its Subsidiaries  are in full  force and effect,
the  Parent or  such Subsidiary  enjoys quiet and undisturbed
possession  under all leases of real property and neither the
Parent nor any of  its Subsidiaries is in default  beyond any
applicable grace period of  any provision thereof, the effect
of which  could  reasonably be  expected to  have a  Material
Adverse effect.

K.    Federal Reserve Regulations; Use of Loan Proceeds

Neither the Parent nor  any of its Subsidiaries is
engaged principally,  or as one of  its important activities,
in the  business  of  extending credit  for  the  purpose  of
purchasing  or carrying  any Margin  Stock.   No part  of the
proceeds  of the Loans or any Letter  of Credit will be used,
directly  or indirectly,  for  a purpose  which violates  the
provisions of  Regulations  G, T,  U  or X  of the  Board  of
Governors of  the Federal Reserve  System, as amended.   Any-
thing in  this Agreement to the  contrary notwithstanding, no
Lender shall be obligated  to extend credit to the  Parent or
any of  its Subsidiaries  in violation of  any limitation  or
prohibition  provided by  any applicable  law, regulation  or
statute, including Regulation U of  the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System.

L.    No Misrepresentation

No  representation  or warranty  contained  in any
Loan Document and no  certificate, Financial Statement, other
financial  statement or  written  notice furnished  or to  be
furnished by the Parents  or any of its Subsidiaries  in con-
nection with  the transactions contemplated  hereby, contains
or will contain, as  of its date, a misstatement  of material<PAGE>





fact,  or omits  or will  omit to  state, as  of its  date, a
material  fact required  to be  stated in  order to  make the
statements therein  contained not misleading in  the light of
the circumstances under which made.

M.    Plans

(a) Each Employee Benefit Plan of the Parent, each
of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate is in compliance
withERISA and the Code, where applicable, in all material re-
spects.  The amount  of (a) all Unfunded Pension  Liabilities
under the Pension Plans, excluding  any Pension Plan which is
a Multiemployer Plan, does not exceed $2,000,000, and (b) the
aggregate  Unrecognized Retiree  Welfare Liability  under all
applicable Employee Benefit Plans does not exceed $2,000,000.
The Parent, each of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA Affiliate
have complied with  the requirements of Section  515 of ERISA
with  respect to each  Pension Plan which  is a Multiemployer
Plan.  The  aggregate potential  annual withdrawal  liability
payments, as determined in accordance with Title IV of ERISA,
for which the Parent, each of its Subsidiaries and each ERISA
Affiliate would become obligated  in the event of  a complete
or   partial  withdrawal  from all  Pension  Plans which  are
Multiemployer Plans does not  exceed $2,000,000.  The Parent,
each of its  Subsidiaries and each  ERISA Affiliate has  made
all contributions or  payments to or under  each such Pension
Plan required by law or the terms of such Pension Plan or any
contract  or  agreement  where   the  failure  to  make  such
contributions  or payments  could reasonably  be expected  to
have a Material Adverse effect.  No liability to the PBGC has
been, or is expected  by the Parent, any of  its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate to be, incurred  by the Parent, any of
its Subsidiaries or any  ERISA Affiliate where such liability
could  reasonably  be expected  to  have  a Material  Adverse
effect.   Liability,  as referred  to in  this Section  4.13,
includes any joint and several liability.  Each Employee Ben-
efit Plan which is a group  health plan within the meaning of
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code is in material compliance with
the continuation of health care coverage requirements of Sec-
tion 4980B of the Code.

(b) All contributions required to be made with re-
spect to  each Foreign  Pension Plan  have been timely  made.
Each Foreign  Pension Plan has been  maintained in compliance
with its terms  and with the requirements of  any and all ap-
plicable  laws, statutes,  rules, regulations and  orders and
has been  maintained, where  required, in good  standing with
applicable Governmental  Authorities.  Neither the Parent nor
any  of  its  Subsidiaries  has incurred  any  obligation  in
connection  with the  termination of  or withdrawal  from any
Foreign Pension  Plan.   The  present  value of  the  accrued
benefit  liabilities  (whether  or  not  vested)  under  each
Foreign Pension Plan required to  be funded, determined as of
the end of the  most recently ended fiscal year on  the basis<PAGE>





of actuarial  assumptions, each  of which is  reasonable, did
not  exceed the current value  of the assets  of such Foreign
Pension Plan  allocable to  such benefit liabilities  by more
than the foreign exchange equivalent (based on the applicable
spot exchange rate) of $2,000,000.

N.    Environmental Matters

Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (a)
has  received  written notice  or  otherwise  learned of  any
claim,   demand,   action,   event,  condition,   report   or
investigation  indicating  or  concerning  any  potential  or
actual liability which individually or in the aggregate could
reasonably  be expected  to have  a Material  Adverse effect,
arising  in connection  with (i)  any non-compliance  with or
violation  of the  requirements  of any  applicable  federal,
state,  local  or  foreign  environmental  health  or  safety
statute  or regulation,  or  (ii) the  release or  threatened
release  of any  toxic  or  hazardous  waste,   substance  or
constituent, or other substance  into the environment, (b) to
the best knowledge of  the Parent and the Borrowers,  has any
threatened or actual liability in connection with the release
or  threatened release of any toxic  or hazardous waste, sub-
stance or  constituent, or other substance  into the environ-
ment which individually or  in the aggregate could reasonably
be  expected  to have  a  Material  Adverse effect,  (c)  has
received  notice  of any  federal,  state,  local or  foreign
investigation  evaluating  whether  any  remedial  action  is
needed to respond to  a release or threatened release  of any
toxic or  hazardous waste, substance or  constituent or other
substance into the environment for which the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is or would be liable, which liability would
reasonably  be expected to have a Material Adverse effect, or
(d)  has  received  notice that  the  Parent  or  any of  its
Subsidiaries  is or  may be  liable to  any Person  under the
Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, Compensation  and Li-
ability Act, as amended,  42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et  seq., or
any analogous  state, local  or foreign law,  which liability
would  reasonably  be expected  to  have  a Material  Adverse
effect.   The  Parent  and each  of  its Subsidiaries  is  in
compliance with the  financial responsibility requirements of
federal, state,  local and foreign environmental  laws to the
extent applicable,  including those  contained in  40 C.F.R.,
parts  264 and  265, subpart  H, and  any analogous  federal,
state, local or foreign  law, except in those cases  in which
the  failure so to comply would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse effect.

O.    Financial Statements

The Parent has heretofore delivered to the  Admin-
istrative Agent and the  Lenders copies of its Form  10-K for
the fiscal  year ended January  31, 1995, containing  the au-
dited Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Parent  and its Sub-<PAGE>





sidiaries as of such date and the related Consolidated State-
ments of  Income, Stockholders' Equity and Cash Flows for the
fiscal  year then  ended (collectively,  with the  applicable
related  notes  and schedules,  the  "Financial Statements").
The Financial Statements fairly present  the Consolidated fi-
nancial condition and results of the operations of the Parent
and  its Subsidiaries  as of  the dates  and for  the periods
indicated therein  and have been prepared  in conformity with
GAAP  as then  in  effect subject,  in  the case  of  interim
Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments. Neither
the  Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or
liability of any  kind (whether  fixed, accrued,  contingent,
unmatured  or otherwise)  which, in  accordance with  GAAP as
then  in effect, should have been  disclosed in the Financial
Statements  and was not.   Since January 31,  1995, there has
been no Material Adverse change.

P.    Franchises, Intellectual Property, Etc.

Each of  the Parent  and each of  its Subsidiaries
possesses   or  has   the  right   to  use   all  franchises,
Intellectual Property, licenses and other rights as are mate-
rial  and necessary for the conduct of its business, and with
respect  to which it is in compliance, with no known conflict
with the valid rights of others which could reasonably be ex-
pected to have  a Material Adverse effect.  No  event has oc-
curred  which permits or, to the best knowledge of the Parent
and the Borrowers, after notice or the lapse of time or both,
or  any  other condition,  could  reasonably  be expected  to
permit, the revocation or  termination of any such franchise,
Intellectual   Property,   license  or   other   right  which
revocation or  termination could  reasonably  be expected  to
have a Material Adverse effect.

Q.    Labor Relations

Except as set forth  on Schedule 4.17, neither the
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a  party to any collec-
tive bargaining agreement  and, to the best  knowledge of the
Parent  and the Borrowers, no petition has been filed or pro-
ceedings  instituted by  any employee  or group  of employees
with  any  labor relations  board  seeking  recognition of  a
bargaining representative with respect  to the Parent or such
Subsidiary.   There  are  no material  controversies  pending
between  the Parent  or any  of its  Subsidiaries and  any of
their  respective  employees,   which  could  reasonably   be
expected to have a Material Adverse effect.


V.   CONDITIONS  OF LENDING  - LOANS  ON THE  FIRST BORROWING

the obligation of each Lender to make  one or more Loans, the<PAGE>





obligation of the Swing Line Lender to make one or more Swing
Line  Loans and the obligation  of the Issuing  Bank to issue

points BNY as  the Administrative Agent of such  Lender under
the Loan  Documents and  each such Lender  hereby irrevocably
authorizes BNY, as the  Administrative Agent for such Lender,
to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the
Loan Documents  and to exercise such powers  and perform such
duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent
by  the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this  Agreement or
any Loan  Document, the  Administrative Agent shall  not have
any duties or responsibilities other than those expressly set
forth herein  or therein, or any  fiduciary relationship with
the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender or any Lender, and no
implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obli-
gations or  liabilities shall be read into the Loan Documents
or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

B. Delegation of Duties

The Administrative  Agent may  execute any  of its
duties  under the  Loan  Documents by  or  through agents  or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to rely  upon the ad-<PAGE>





vice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such du-
ties.

C. Exculpatory Provisions

Neither the  Administrative Agent  nor any of  its
officers, directors, employees, agents,  attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates shall be (i) liable  for any action lawfully taken
or omitted to be taken  by it or such Person under or in con-
nection with  the Loan  Documents (except  the Administrative
Agent for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or
(ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for  any
recitals, statements, representations  or warranties made  by
the Credit Parties or any officers of the Credit Parties con-
tained in the  Loan Documents or in any  certificate, report,
statement  or other document referred  to or provided for in,
or  received by  the Administrative  Agent under  or in  con-
nection with, the Loan Documents or for  the value, validity,
effectiveness,  genuineness,  perfection,  enforceability  or
sufficiency of any of  the Loan Documents or for  any failure
of the Credit  Parties  or  any other  Person to perform  its
obligations  hereunder or  thereunder.    The  Administrative
Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to  as-
certain  or to inquire as to the observance or performance of
any of  the agreements  contained in,  or conditions of,  the
Loan  Documents,  or  to  inspect the  properties,  books  or
records  of the  Credit  Parties.   The Administrative  Agent
shall  not be  under  any liability  or responsibility  what-
soever, as Administrative Agent, to the Credit Parties or any
other Person as a consequence of any failure or delay in per-
formance, or any breach, by any  Lender of any of its obliga-
tions under the Loan Documents.

D. Reliance by Administrative Agent

The  Administrative  Agent  shall  be  entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writ-
ing,  resolution,  notice,  consent, certificate,  affidavit,
opinion,  letter, cablegram, telegram, fax, telex or teletype
message, statement, order  or other document or  conversation
believed by  it to  be genuine and  correct and to  have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon
advice and statements of  legal counsel (including counsel to
any of the Credit Parties), independent accountants and other
experts  selected  by  the  Administrative Agent.    The  Ad-
ministrative  Agent  may treat  each  Lender,  or the  Person
designated in the last  notice filed with it under  this Sec-
tion, as the holder of all of the interests of such Lender in
its Loans until  written notice of  transfer, signed by  such
Lender (or  the Person designated  in the  last notice  filed
with the  Administrative Agent) and by  the Person designated
in such  written notice  of transfer,  in form and  substance
satisfactory to  the Administrative  Agent,  shall have  been
filed  with  the Administrative  Agent.    The Administrative<PAGE>





Agent shall not be under any duty to examine or pass upon the
validity,   effectiveness,   enforceability,  perfection   or
genuineness of any  of the Loan Documents  or any instrument,
document   or  communication  furnished  pursuant  hereto  or
thereto  or  in connection  herewith  or  therewith, and  the
Administrative  Agent shall  be entitled  to assume  that the
same are valid,  effective and genuine,  have been signed  or
sent by the proper parties and  are what they purport to  be.
The Administrative Agent shall  be fully justified in failing
or  refusing  to take  any  action under  the  Loan Documents
unless it shall first  receive such advice or concurrence  of
the Required Lenders  as it deems appropriate.   The Adminis-
trative  Agent  shall  in all  cases  be  fully protected  in
acting,  or  in  refraining   from  acting,  under  the  Loan
Documents  in accordance with  a request or  direction of the
Required  Lenders,  and such  request  or  direction and  any
action  taken or  failure to  act pursuant  thereto shall  be
binding  upon the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and all
of  the Lenders and all future holders of the Indebtedness of
the Credit Parties under the Loan Documents.

The Administrative  Agent shall  not be  deemed to
have  knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received
written notice thereof from the Issuing Bank,  the Swing Line
Lender, any Lender, or any Credit Parties.  In the event that
the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Adminis-
trative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Issu-
ing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and the Lenders. The Adminis-
trative Agent shall take such action with respect to such De-
fault  or  Event  of Default  as  shall  be  directed by  the
Required Lenders,  provided, however,  that unless and  until
the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions,
the Administrative Agent may (but shall not  be obligated to)
take such action,  or refrain from  taking such action,  with
respect to such Default or Event of Default  as it shall deem
to be in  the best interests  of the Issuing Bank,  the Swing
Line Lender and the Lenders.

F. Non-Reliance

The Issuing  Bank, the Swing Line  Lender and each
Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of  its respective officers, directors, employ-
ees,  agents,  attorneys-in-fact or  affiliates has  made any
representations  or warranties to it  and that no  act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter, including any review of the
affairs of the Credit Parties, shall be deemed  to constitute
any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to
the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line  Lender or any Lender.   The
Issuing Bank,  the Swing Line  Lender and each  Lender repre-
sents to the Administrative  Agent that it has, independently<PAGE>





and  without reliance  upon the  Administrative Agent  or any
other Lender,  and based on such documents and information as
it has  deemed appropriate,  made its  own evaluation  of and
investigation  into  the   business,  operations,   Property,
financial  and  other condition  and creditworthiness  of the
Credit Parties and made  its own decision to enter  into this
Agreement.   The Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and each
Lender  also  represents  that  it  will,  independently  and
without reliance  upon the Administrative  Agent, the Issuing
Bank, the Swing Line Lender or any other Lender, and based on
such documents  and information as it  shall deem appropriate
at  the  time, continue  to  make  its own  credit  analysis,
evaluations  and decisions  in  taking or  not taking  action
under  the Loan Documents, and to  make such investigation as
it deems  necessary  to inform  itself  as to  the  business,
operations,  Property,  financial  and  other  condition  and
creditworthiness of the Credit  Parties.  Except for notices,
reports  and  other   documents  expressly  required   to  be
furnished  to the Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and the
Lenders by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents,
the  Administrative   Agent  shall  not  have   any  duty  or
responsibility to  provide the  Issuing Bank, the  Swing Line
Lender or  any Lender with  any credit  or other  information
concerning the business, operations, Property,  financial and
other condition  or creditworthiness  of  the Credit  Parties
which  may come  into  the possession  of the  Administrative
Agent  or any of its officers,  directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

G. Indemnification

Each  Lender agrees to indemnify and reimburse the
Administrative Agent in  its capacity as such (to  the extent
not  promptly reimbursed  by the  Credit Parties  and without
limiting  the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), pro
rata  according  to  (i)  at  any  time  when  no  Loans  are
outstanding, its Commitment Percentage, or if no  Commitments
then exist,  its Commitment  Percentage on  the  last day  on
which  Commitments did exist, and (ii) at any time when Loans
are  outstanding  (x)  if  the Commitments  then  exist,  its
Commitment  Percentage or  (y) if  the Commitments  have been
terminated or otherwise no longer exist, the percentage equal
to  the fraction  (A) the  numerator of  which is  the Credit
Exposure of such Lender  and (B) the denominator of  which is
the Aggregate Credit Exposure, from  and against any and  all
liabilities,  obligations,  losses,  damages, penalties,  ac-
tions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses  or disbursements of
any kind whatsoever including any amounts paid to the Lenders
(through the Administrative Agent) by the Credit Parties pur-
suant to the  terms of  the Loan Documents,  that are  subse-
quently rescinded  or avoided, or must  otherwise be restored
or returned) which  may at  any time (including  at any  time
following  the  payment of  the  Loans  or the  reimbursement
obligations hereunder with respect  to the Letters of Credit)<PAGE>





be  imposed   on,  incurred   by  or  asserted   against  the
Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
the Loan Documents or any  other documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Ad-
ministrative Agent under or in connection with the foregoing;
provided, however,  that no  Lender shall  be liable for  the
payment  of any  portion  of  such liabilities,  obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or  disbursements to  the extent resulting  from the
finally adjudicated gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Administrative  Agent.   Without limitation of  the fore-
going,  each Lender  agrees to  reimburse  the Administrative
Agent promptly upon demand for its pro rata share (calculated
as set  forth in the first  sentence of this Section)  of any
unpaid  costs and  expenses  (including reasonable  fees  and
expenses  of counsel)  payable  by the  Credit Parties  under
Section 11.5, to the extent that the Administrative Agent has
not been reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Credit
Parties.    The  failure  of  any  Lender  to  reimburse  the
Administrative Agent  promptly upon  demand for its  pro rata
share (as so calculated) of any amount required to be paid by
the  Lenders to the Administrative Agent  as provided in this
Section  shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation
hereunder to  reimburse the Administrative Agent  for its pro
rata share (as so calculated) of  such  amount, but no Lender
shall be responsible for  the failure of any other  Lender to
reimburse  the Administrative Agent  for such  other Lender's
pro rata share (as so calculated) of such amount.  The agree-
ments  in  this Section  shall  survive  the payment  of  all
amounts payable under the Loan Documents.

H. Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity

BNY and  its affiliates may make  loans to, accept
deposits  from, issue letters  of credit for  the account of,
and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Credit
Parties  or any of  the Subsidiaries of the Parent as  though
BNY were  not the Issuing Bank, the  Swing Line Lender or the
Administrative Agent hereunder.   With respect to the Commit-
ment,  the  Swing  Line Commitment,  the  Individual Currency
Commitment and the Letter of Credit Commitment of BNY and the
Loans made by BNY,  and the Letters of Credit issued  by BNY,
BNY  shall have  the same  rights and  powers under  the Loan
Documents as any Lender  and may exercise the same  as though
it were  not the Issuing Bank,  the Swing Line  Lender or the
Administrative Agent, and  the terms  "Lender" and  "Lenders"
shall in each case include BNY.

I. Successor Administrative Agent

If at  any time the Administrative  Agent deems it
advisable, in its sole  discretion, it may submit to  each of
the Issuing Bank,  the Swing  Line Lender and  each Lender  a<PAGE>





written notice of its resignation as Administrative Agent un-
der the Loan Documents, such resignation to be effective upon
the written  acceptance of  the duties of  the Administrative
Agent under the Loan  Documents by a successor Administrative
Agent appointed by the  Required Lenders,  provided, however,
that if no such appointment is made and given within  30 days
after  the  delivery  of  such  notice  of  resignation,  the
Administrative  Agent  shall  have  the right  to  appoint  a
successor  Administrative  Agent. A  successor Administrative
Agent  shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of
the  United States of America or any State thereof and having
a  combined capital,  surplus,  and undivided  profits of  at
least $500,000,000 and, provided that no  Default or Event of
Default shall exist, shall  be reasonably satisfactory to the
Parent.    Upon the  acceptance  of  any  appointment as  Ad-
ministrative  Agent hereunder  by a  successor Administrative
Agent,  such successor  Administrative Agent  shall thereupon
succeed  to and become  vested with  all the  rights, powers,
privileges and duties  of the retiring Administrative  Agent,
and  the  retiring  Administrative  Agent's  rights,  powers,
privileges and duties as  Administrative Agent under the Loan
Documents  shall  be terminated.    The  Credit Parties,  the
Issuing Bank,  the Swing Line  Lender and  the Lenders  shall
execute such documents  as shall be necessary to  effect such
appointment.    After any  retiring   Administrative  Agent's
resignation as Administrative  Agent, the  provisions of  the
Loan Documents shall inure  to its benefit as to  any actions
taken  or  omitted   to  be   taken  by  it   while  it   was
Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.

Lender  to  increase  its  Commitment,  or  any  other  bank,
insurance  company,  pension  fund,   mutual  fund  or  other
financial institution  (each a "Proposed  Lender"; each  such
Proposed Lender  to be  reasonably satisfactory to  the Swing
Line  Lender   and  the  Issuing  Bank)  to   provide  a  new
Commitment, by  submitting a supplement to  this Agreement to
the Administrative  Agent, the  Issuing Bank, the  Swing Line
Lender and the Credit Parties.  If such  supplement is in all
respects satisfactory  to it,  the Administrative  Agent, the
Issuing Bank, the  Swing Line Lender, the Parent,  each other
Credit  Party and such Lender or Proposed Lender, as the case
may be, shall each execute a  copy thereof and deliver a copy
thereof  to the  Administrative  Agent, the  Parent and  such<PAGE>

such Lender, the amount of  such Lender's Commitment shall be
increased to the amount set forth in such supplement, (ii) in
the case of such Proposed Lender, such Proposed  Lender shall
become  a party  hereto and  shall for  all purposes  of this
Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents be deemed a "Lender"
with a Commitment and one or more Individual Currency Commit-
ments in the respective amounts set forth  in such supplement
and (iii) in  each case, the  Commitments and the  Commitment
Percentages set forth in  Exhibit A-1 and the Individual Com-
mitments set  forth in Exhibit A-2 shall  be adjusted accord-
ingly by the Administrative Agent and a new Exhibit A-1 and a
new  Exhibit A-2 shall be  distributed by  the Administrative
Agent to the  Parent (on  behalf of all  Borrowers) and  each
Lender; provided, however, that:

(x) immediately after giving  effect thereto,  the
Aggregate Commitments shall not exceed $160,000,000; and

(y) notwithstanding anything to the  contrary con-
tained in Section 11.7, if immediately after giving effect to
the events  described in Sections  11.1(b)(i) or 11.1(b)(ii),
as   the case  may  be, Revolving  Loans  shall or  would  be
outstanding, then such Lender or such Proposed Lender, as the
case  may  be,  shall  enter into  a  master  assignment  and
acceptance agreement  with the other Lenders  in all respects
reasonably satisfactory  to  the other  Lenders, pursuant  to
which  each other  Lender  shall sell,  assign, transfer  and
negotiate to it a portion of its Revolving Loans necessary to
reflect  the  Commitments  as  adjusted  in  accordance  with
Section 11.1(b)(iii).

(c) Any such  amendment, supplement,  modification
or waiver pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall be binding upon
the parties to the applicable agreement, all  present and fu-
ture  Lenders and the Administrative  Agent.  In  the case of
any waiver,  the parties to  the Loan Documents,  the Issuing
Bank,   the  Swing   Line   Lender,  the   Lenders  and   the
Administrative  Agent  shall  be  restored  to  their  former
position and rights thereunder to the extent provided  for in
such waiver, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall
not extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of De-
fault,  or impair  any right  consequent thereon.   The  Loan
Documents  may  not be  amended orally  or  by any  course of
conduct.

(d) If any assignment made pursuant  to subsection
(b)(y)  above shall be made  to any Proposed  Lender and such
Proposed Lender  is not a  U.S. Person, such  Proposed Lender
shall furnish such certificates, documents or other  evidence
to the Parent, the Borrowers, the Lenders and the Administra-
tive  Agent  as  shall  be required  by  Section  2.13(e)  or
2.13(f).<PAGE>

on  the part  of  the Administrative  Agent,  the Swing  Line
Lender, the  Issuing Bank or  any Lender, any  right, remedy,

The rights,  remedies, powers  and privileges under  the Loan<PAGE>





Documents  are cumulative  and not  exclusive of  any rights,
remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

All representations and warranties made  under the
Loan Documents and in  any document, certificate or statement
delivered pursuant  thereto or in connection  therewith shall
survive the execution and delivery thereof.

The  Parent and  each Borrower  (to the  extent of
such other  Borrower's Proportionate  Share of the  amount at
issue)  severally agrees,  promptly  upon  presentation of  a
statement or invoice  therefor, and whether any Loan is made,
or any Letter of Credit is issued (i) to pay or reimburse the
Administrative  Agent for  all of the  Administrative Agent's
out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably  incurred in con-
nection with the preparation  of the Loan Documents and   any
amendment,   supplement  or  modification   (whether  or  not
executed) to the Loan   Documents, any documents  prepared in
connection therewith and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  thereby,  including  the  reasonable  fees  and
disbursements of  Special Counsel,  (ii) to pay  or reimburse
the Administrative  Agent, the  Issuing Bank, the  Swing Line
Lender  and the Lenders for all of their respective costs and
expenses,  including reasonable  fees  and  disbursements  of
counsel, incurred in connection with (A) any Default or Event
of  Default and  any  enforcement or  collection  proceedings
resulting therefrom or in  connection with the negotiation of
any  restructuring or "work-out" (whether consummated or not)
of  the obligations of the Parent and the Borrowers under the
Loan Documents and (B) the enforcement of this Section, (iii)
to  pay, indemnify,  and  hold each  Lender,  the Swing  Line
Lender, the  Issuing Bank and the  Administrative Agent harm-
less  from and against, any and all recording and filing fees
and  any and  all liabilities  with respect to,  or resulting
from any  delay in  paying, stamp,  excise and  other similar
taxes,  if any, which may be payable or determined to be pay-
able in  connection with the  execution and  delivery of,  or
consummation of  any of the transactions  contemplated by, or

alties, actions,  judgments, suits,  costs, expenses  or dis-
bursements  of  any  kind  or  nature  whatsoever  (including
reasonable counsel  fees and  disbursements) with  respect to
the enforcement and performance of the Loan Documents and the
use of the  proceeds of the Loans  and the Letters of  Credit<PAGE>





(all   the  foregoing,  collectively,  the  "indemnified  li-
abilities"); provided,  however, that neither  the Parent nor
the Borrowers shall have any  obligation hereunder to pay in-
demnified  liabilities to the Administrative Agent, the Swing
Line  Lender, the Issuing Bank or any Lender arising from the
finally adjudicated gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Administrative Agent, the  Swing Line Lender, the Issuing
Bank or such  Lender or claims between  one indemnified party
and  another  indemnified  party.   The  agreements  in  this
Section shall  survive the termination of  the Aggregate Com-
mitments,  the Swing  Line Commitment,  the Letter  of Credit
Commitment and the  Individual Currency  Commitments and  the
payment of all amounts payable under the Loan Documents.

F. Determination of Dollar Equivalent

For  purposes of  the Loan  Documents, the  Dollar
Equivalent of each Alternate Currency Loan and each Letter of
Credit  designated  in   an  Alternate   Currency  shall   be
recalculated (i) on the  first day of each Borrowing/Issuance
Period, (ii) on the date that the Agent shall have received a
Bid Accept/Reject Letter accepting a Bid or a Negotiated Rate
Confirmation,  (iii)   on  each  date   that  the   Aggregate
Commitments  are, or the  Swing Line Commitment  or any Indi-
vidual  Currency Commitment is, reduced  and (iv) on the last
Business Day of  each month unless the  Dollar Equivalent was
recalculated  pursuant to  clause (i),  (ii) or  (iii) during
such month.   The Dollar Equivalent  for each Alternate  Cur-
rency  Loan and  each  Letter  of  Credit  designated  in  an
Alternate Currency shall  remain in effect until  the same is
recalculated by  the Administrative  Agent as  provided above
and  notice of such recalculation is  received by the Parent,
it being understood  that until such notice is  received, the
Dollar  Equivalent  shall be  that  Dollar  Equivalent.   The
Administrative  Agent shall promptly  notify the  Parent, the
Issuing Bank, the Swing  Line Lender and the Lenders  of each
such  determination of  the  Dollar Equivalent  for each  Al-
ternate Currency Loan and each Letter of Credit designated in
an Alternate Currency.

G. Assignments and Participations

(a) This  Agreement and  the other  Loan Documents
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parent,
the  Borrowers,  the  Lenders,  the Swing  Line  Lender,  the
Issuing  Bank, the Administrative Agent, and their respective
successors and  assigns, except  that neither the  Parent nor

prior  written  consent  of  the  Administrative  Agent,  the
Issuing Bank, the Swing Line Lender and each Lender.

(b) Except  as provided  in Section  11.1(b), each
Lender  shall have the right at any time, upon written notice<PAGE>

Lender's rights  and obligations under the  Loan Documents to
one or  more of its affiliates,  to one or more  of the other
Lenders (or to affiliates of such other Lenders) or, with the
prior  written consent of  the Parent, the  Swing Line Lender
and   the  Issuing   Bank  (which   consents  shall   not  be
unreasonably   withheld),  to   sell,  assign,   transfer  or
negotiate  all  or  any  part  of  such Lender's  rights  and
obligations  under  the Loan  Documents  to  any other  bank,
insurance company, pension fund,  mutual fund or other finan-
cial institution,  provided that (i) each  such sale, assign-
ment, transfer or negotiation (other than sales, assignments,
transfers or negotiations (x) to affiliates of such Lender or
(y)  of a  Lender's entire  interest) shall  be in  a minimum
amount of $5,000,000, and (ii) there shall be paid to the Ad-
ministrative Agent by the assigning  or assignee Lender a fee
(the "Assignment Fee") of $3,000.   For each assignment,  the
parties to  such assignment shall execute and  deliver to the
Administrative Agent for its acceptance and  recording an As-
signment and Acceptance Agreement.   Upon such execution, de-
livery, acceptance and recording by the Administrative Agent,
from  and after  the  effective date  specified  in such  As-
signment  and Acceptance  Agreement, the  assignee thereunder
shall  be a party hereto and, to  the extent provided in such
Assignment  and  Acceptance  Agreement, the  assignor  Lender
thereunder shall  be released from its  obligations under the
Loan Documents.   Upon  any  such sale,  assignment or  other
transfer, the Commitments and  the Commitment Percentages set
forth in Exhibit A-1, and the Individual Currency Commitments
set forth  in Exhibit A-2,  shall be adjusted  accordingly by
the  Administrative Agent  and  a new  Exhibit A-1 and  a new
Exhibit A-2 shall be distributed by  the Administrative Agent
to the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers) and each Lender.

(c) Each Lender may grant participations in all or
any  part  of  its  rights  and  obligations  under  the Loan
Documents to one or more of its affiliates, to one or more of
the other Lenders (or to affiliates of such other Lenders) or
to  one or  more  other banks,  insurance companies,  pension
funds, mutual funds or other financial institutions, provided
that (i)  such Lender's obligations under  the Loan Documents
shall remain unchanged, (ii)  such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to  the other parties  to the Loan  Documents for
the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuing Bank
and  the other  Lenders  shall continue  to  deal solely  and
directly with  such Lender  in connection with  such Lender's
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, (iv) no sub-
participations shall  be permitted and (v)  the voting rights
of  any holder of any participation shall be limited to deci-
sions  that  in  accordance  with Section  11.1  require  the
consent of all of the Lenders.   The Parent and the Borrowers
acknowledge  and agree  that any  such participant  shall for<PAGE>





purposes of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.22, 11.5 and  11.10,
be deemed  to be a  "Lender"; provided, however,  neither the
Parent  nor the Borrowers shall, at any time, be obligated to
pay any participant in  any interest of any  Lender hereunder
any sum  in  excess of  the  sum  which the  Parent  and  the
Borrowers  would have been obligated to pay to such Lender in
respect of such interest  had such Lender not sold  such par-
ticipation.

(d) If any (i) assignment is made pursuant to sub-
section (b) above or (ii) any participation is granted pursu-
ant to subsection (c) above, shall be made to any Person that
is not a U.S. Person, such Person shall furnish such certifi-
cates, documents or other evidence to the Parent, the Borrow-
ers and the Administrative  Agent, in the case of  clause (i)
and  to the Parent, the  Borrowers and the  Lender which sold
such  participation in the case  of clause (ii),  as shall be
required by Section 2.13(e) or 2.13(f).

(e) No Lender shall, as between and among the Par-
ent, the Borrowers, the  Administrative Agent, the Swing Line
Lender,  the Issuing Bank and such Lender, be relieved of any
of  its obligations under the  Loan Documents as  a result of
any sale, assignment, transfer or negotiation of, or granting
of  participations  in, all  or any  part  of its  rights and
obligations under  the Loan  Documents, except that  a Lender
shall be relieved of its obligations under the Loan Documents
to the  extent of  any  such sale,  assignment, transfer,  or
negotiation of all or  any part of its obligations  under the
Loan Documents pursuant to subsection (b) above.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary con-
tained in  this Section, any  Lender may at any  time or from
time to time assign  all or any  portion of its rights  under
the Loan Documents  to a Federal Reserve  Bank, provided that
any such assignment shall not release such  assignor from its
obligations thereunder.

H. Counterparts

Each of the Loan Documents may be executed  by one
or  more of  the parties  thereto on  any number  of separate
counterparts  and all  of  said  counterparts taken  together
shall be deemed to constitute one and the same  document.  It
shall not be necessary  in making proof of any  Loan Document
to produce or account for more than one counterpart signed by
the party to be charged.  An executed counterpart of any Loan
Document  and of  any  amendment,  modification,  consent  or
waiver thereto or thereof transmitted by  fax shall be deemed
to be an originally executed counterpart.  A copy of any Loan
Document signed by all the parties thereto shall be deposited
with the Parent (on behalf of all Borrowers) and the Adminis-
trative Agent.  Any party to  any Loan Document may rely upon
the  signatures   of  any  other  party   thereto  which  are<PAGE>





transmitted  by fax or other electronic means to the same ex-
tent as if originally signed.

I. Adjustments; Set-off

(a) If any  Lender (a "Benefited Lender") shall at
any time receive any payment of all or any part of its Loans,
or  interest thereon,  or receive  any collateral  in respect
thereof  (whether voluntarily  or involuntarily,  by set-off,
pursuant to  events or proceedings of the  nature referred to
in  Section  9.1  (g) or  (h),  or  otherwise)  in a  greater
proportion than  any such payment to  and collateral received
by  any other Lender in respect of such other Lender's Loans,
or interest thereon, such Benefited Lender shall purchase for
cash from each of the other Lenders such portion of each such
other Lender's Loans,  and shall provide  each of such  other
Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the pro-
ceeds  thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefited
Lender  to share  the  excess  payment  or benefits  of  such
collateral  or proceeds  ratably  with each  of the  Lenders,
provided,  however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment  or  benefits  is   thereafter  recovered  from  such
Benefited Lender,  such purchase shall be  rescinded, and the
purchase price and  benefits returned, to the extent  of such
recovery,  but without  interest.   The Borrowers  agree that
each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Loans
may exercise all rights of payment (including  rights of set-
off, to the  extent not  prohibited by law)  with respect  to
such  portion  as fully  as if  such  Lender were  the direct
holder of such portion.

(b) In addition to any  rights and remedies of the
Lenders provided by law,  upon the occurrence of an  Event of
Default and the acceleration of the obligations owing in con-
nection with  the Loan Documents, or at any time upon the oc-
currence and during the continuance  of an Event of  Default,
under Section 9.1(a), (b), (g) or (h), each Lender shall have
the  right, without prior notice to the Parent or the Borrow-
ers, any such notice being expressly waived by the Parent and
the Borrowers to the extent not prohibited by applicable law,
to  set-off  and  apply  against  any  indebtedness,  whether
matured  or unmatured, of the Parent or the Borrowers to such
Lender,  any amount owing from  such Lender to  the Parent or
the Borrowers, at, or at any time after, the happening of any
of the above-mentioned events.  To the  extent not prohibited
by applicable  law, the  aforesaid  right of  set-off may  be
exercised by such Lender against the Parent and the Borrowers
or against  any trustee  in bankruptcy, custodian,  debtor in
possession, assignee for the benefit of  creditors, receiver,
or execution,  judgment or attachment creditor  of the Parent
or  the Borrowers, or against anyone else claiming through or
against the  Parent  or  the Borrowers  or  such  trustee  in
bankruptcy, custodian, debtor in possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or at-<PAGE>





tachment creditor,  notwithstanding the fact that  such right
of set-off shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior
to  the making,  filing  or issuance,  or  service upon  such
Lender of, or of notice of, any such petition, assignment for
the benefit of creditors,  appointment or application for the
appointment  of  a  receiver,   or  issuance  of   execution,
subpoena,  order or warrant.   Each Lender agrees promptly to
notify the Parent, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent
after any such set-off and  application made by such  Lender,
provided  that  the failure  to  give such  notice  shall not
affect the  validity of such  set-off and application.   With
respect to each  Borrower, the right of  set-off provided for
in this Section 11.9(b)  shall be limited to  the obligations
of such Borrower with respect to  Loans made to it and to its
Proportionate  Share  of  other  costs,  expenses  and  other
amounts.

J. Indemnity

Each of the Borrowers to the extent of its Propor-
tionate Share and the Parent severally agree to indemnify and
hold  harmless  the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Swing  Line
Lender, the Issuing Bank and each Lender and their respective
affiliates,  directors,  officers,  employees, attorneys  and
agents (each  an "Indemnified  Person") with respect  to each
Indemnified Person's status under the Loan Documents from and
against  any  loss,  cost,   liability,  damage  or   expense
(including  the reasonable fees  and disbursements of counsel
of such Indemnified Person, including all local counsel hired
by any such  counsel) incurred by such  Indemnified Person in
investigating, preparing for, defending against, or providing
evidence, producing  documents or taking any  other action in
respect  of,   any   commenced  or   threatened   litigation,
administrative  proceeding or investigation under any federal
securities law or  any other statute of  any jurisdiction, or
any regulation, or at  common law or otherwise, which  is al-
leged to arise out of or is based upon (i)  any untrue state-
ment  or alleged untrue statement of any material fact by the
Parent or the Borrowers in  any document or schedule executed
or filed with any  Governmental Authority by or on  behalf of
the Parent  or the Borrowers;  (ii) any  omission or  alleged
omission  to state any material fact required to be stated in
such  document   or  schedule,  or  necessary   to  make  the
statements made therein, in  light of the circumstances under
which  made, not  misleading;  (iii) any  acts, practices  or
omissions  or alleged  acts,  practices or  omissions of  the
Parent or  the Borrowers or their  respective agents relating
to the use of the  proceeds of any or all borrowings  made by
the Borrowers which are alleged to be in violation of Section
2.18, or in violation of any federal securities law or of any
otherstatute, regulation or other law of any jurisdiction ap-
plicable  thereto;  or  (iv)   any  acquisition  or  proposed
acquisition by the  Parent or the Borrowers of all  or a por-
tion of the Stock, or all or a portion  of the assets, of any<PAGE>





Person whether  such Indemnified  Person is a  party thereto.
The  indemnity set forth herein  shall be in  addition to any
other  obligations  or  liabilities  of the  Parent  and  the
Borrowers to each Indemnified Person under the Loan Documents
or at common law or otherwise, and shall survive any termina-
tion of  the Loan  Documents, the expiration  of the  Commit-
ments,  the  Letter  of  Credit Commitment,  the  Swing  Line
Commitment, the Individual Currency Commitments, and the pay-
ment of  all  indebtedness of  the Parent  and the  Borrowers
under the Loan  Documents, provided that  the Parent and  the
Borrowers shall have no  obligation under this Section to  an
Indemnified Person  with respect to  any of the  foregoing to
the  extent found  in  a final  judgment  of a  court  having
jurisdiction to have resulted out of the gross  negligence or
wilful misconduct of such  Indemnified Person or arising from
claims between  one such Indemnified Person  and another such
Indemnified Person.

K. GOVERNING LAW

THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS  AND OBLIGATIONS
OF THE PARTIES  THERETO SHALL BE  GOVERNED BY, AND  CONSTRUED
AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS  OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

L. Severability

Every  provision of this  Agreement and  the other
Loan Documents is intended  to be severable, and if  any term
or provision hereof  or thereof shall be  invalid, illegal or
unenforceable  for any  reason,  the  validity, legality  and
enforceability  of the remaining provisions hereof or thereof
shall  not  be affected  or  impaired  thereby,  and any  in-
validity,  illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction
shall not affect the  validity, legality or enforceability of
any such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.

M. Integration

All exhibits to this  Agreement and any other Loan
Document shall be deemed to be  a part hereof or thereof,  as
the  case may be.  Except for agreements between the Adminis-
trative Agent, the  Swing Line Lender,  the Issuing Bank  and
the Parent with  respect to certain fees,  the Loan Documents
embody  the  entire  agreement and  understanding  among  the
Parent,  the Borrowers,  the Administrative Agent,  the Swing
Line Lender, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to
the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and  understandings  among  the  Parent,  the Borrowers,  the
Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuing Bank
and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter thereof.

N. Judgment Currency<PAGE>





(a) Each Credit Party's obligations under the Loan
Documents to  make payments  in the Applicable  Currency (the
"Obligation Currency")  shall not be discharged  or satisfied
by any tender or recovery pursuant  to any judgment expressed
in  or converted into any currency  other than the Obligation
Currency,  except to the extent that, on the Business Day im-
mediately following the  date of such tender or recovery, the
Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Lender, the Issuing Bank
or the  applicable Lender, as  the case  may be, may,  in ac-
cordance with normal banking procedures, purchase the Obliga-
tion Currency with such other currency. If for the purpose of
obtaining or  enforcing judgment against any  Credit Party in
any court or  in any  jurisdiction, it  becomes necessary  to
convert into any currency  other than the Obligation Currency
(such  other currency  being hereinafter  referred to  as the
"Judgment  Currency")   an  amount  due   in  the  Obligation
Currency,   the  conversion  shall be  made  at the  rate  of
exchange at  which, in accordance with  normal banking proce-
dures in the  relevant jurisdiction, the Obligation  Currency
could be purchased with  the Judgment Currency as of  the day
immediately preceding the day on  which the judgment is given
(such  Business  Day being  hereinafter  referred  to as  the
"Judgment Currency Conversion Date").

(b) If the amount of Obligation Currency purchased
pursuant to the last sentence of subsection (a) above is less
than the sum originally due  in the Obligation Currency,  the
applicable Credit Party covenants and agrees to indemnify the
applicable recipient against such loss, and if the Obligation
Currency so purchased exceeds the  sum originally due to such
recipient, such  recipient agrees to remit  to the applicable
Credit Party such excess.

O. Confidentiality

Any information  disclosed by any Credit  Party to
the  Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders shall be used
solely  for purposes  of the  Loan Documents  and not  in any
other manner detrimental to the  Parent and, if such informa-
tion is not otherwise in the public domain, shall not be dis-
closed  by the  Administrative  Agent or  such Lender  to any
other Person except (i) to its independent accountants, legal
counsel and affiliates (it  being understood that the Persons
to  whom  such disclosure  is made  will  be informed  of the
confidential  nature of  such information  and instructed  to
keep  such  information   confidential),  (ii)  pursuant   to
statutory and regulatory requirements  or the request of bank
examiners,  (iii) pursuant  to  any  mandatory  court  order,
subpoena or  other legal process, (iv)  to the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank,  the Swing Line Lender or  any other
Lender, (v) pursuant to any agreement heretofore or hereafter
made between such  Lender and the  Parent which permits  such
disclosure,  (vi)  in connection  with  the  exercise of  any
remedy  under  the  Loan  Documents or  (vii)  subject  to an<PAGE>





agreement  containing  provisions substantially  the  same as
those  of this Section, to any participant in or assignee of,
or  prospective  participant in  or  assignee  of, any  Loan,
Letter of Credit  Commitment, Individual Currency  Commitment
or Commitment  (it being understood  that prior  to any  such
disclosures contemplated by clauses (ii) and (iii) above, the
Agent  or such Lender shall,  if practicable, give the Parent
prior written notice of such disclosure).

P. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION

EACH  CREDIT PARTY  HEREBY IRREVOCABLY  SUBMITS TO
THE  NONEXCLUSIVE  JURISDICTION  OF  ANY NEW  YORK  STATE  OR
FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN  THE CITY OF NEW YORK OVER ANY SUIT,
ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING  OUT OF OR RELATING TO  THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS.    EACH CREDIT PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST  EXTENT PERMITTED OR  NOT PROHIBITED BY  LAW, ANY
OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF
THE VENUE OF ANY  SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING  BROUGHT IN
SUCH A  COURT AND  ANY CLAIM  THAT ANY  SUCH SUIT,  ACTION OR
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN  SUCH A  COURT HAS BEEN  BROUGHT IN  AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM.

Q. Service of Process

Each Credit  Party hereby irrevocably  consents to
the service of process  in any suit, action or  proceeding by
sending the same by  certified mail, return receipt requested
or  by overnight  courier  service, to  the  address of  such
Credit Party set forth in Section 11.2.

R. No Limitation on Service or Suit

Nothing in the Loan Documents or any modification,
waiver, consent  or amendment thereto shall  affect the right
of  the  Administrative Agent,  the  Swing  Line Lender,  the
Issuing Bank or  any Lender  to serve process  in any  manner
permitted  by law  or limit  the right of  the Administrative
Agent,  the Swing Line Lender, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
to bring proceedings against  any Credit Party in  the courts
of  any jurisdiction  or jurisdictions  in which  such Credit
Party may be served.

S. WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY

EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT,  THE SWING LINE
LENDER, THE ISSUING BANK,  THE LENDERS AND EACH CREDIT  PARTY
HEREBY  KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY  AND INTENTIONALLY  WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT  MAY HAVE  TO  A TRIAL  BY JURY  IN  RESPECT OF  ANY
LITIGATION ARISING  OUT OF, UNDER  OR IN CONNECTION  WITH THE
LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

T. International Banking Facilities<PAGE>





The Parent and the Borrowers acknowledge that some
or all  of the Lenders may, in connection with the Loan Docu-
ments, utilize an International  banking facility (as defined
in Regulation D).

Each Borrower which is  an entity located  outside
the United States, understands  that it is the policy  of the
Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System  that
deposits received by International banking facilities may  be
used only  to support the non-U.S. operations  of a depositor
(or its foreign affiliates) located outside the United States
and  that  extensions  of  credit  by  International  banking
facilities  may   be  used  only  to   finance  the  non-U.S.
operations of a customer  (or its foreign affiliates) located
outside the United States.

Each Borrower  which is an entity  located outside
the United States acknowledges that the proceeds  of its bor-
rowings hereunder from an International banking facility will
be used solely to  finance its operations outside the  United
States, or that of its foreign affiliates.<PAGE>

as follows:
(If it is intended, prior to Substantial Completion of the entire Work, to reduce or limit the retainage resulting from the
percentages inserted in Sections 5.1.6.1 and 5.1.6.2 above, and this is not explained elsewhere in the Contract Documents, insert here provisions for such reduction or limitation.)

CLARIFICATIONS:


1.	Owner and Contractor each agree that following the execution of the Construction Contract, no on-site construction or development work, other than such work required
by separate instrument per the development agreement, may begin or occur on the Owner’s property until Contractor receives a written authorization from Owner to proceed with such work. Contractor agrees that Owner will not be liable for any
liens placed on the property or in connection with the construction of any structures on the property unless Owner has given its prior written authorization for such work. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Owner agrees that Contractor may place orders
for materials related to the project and that Owner will be responsible for costs incurred by Contractor for such orders.



2.	This proposal is based on reaching mutually acceptable contract terms.



3.	We have included builder’s risk insurance.



4.	We have included the building permit and plan review fees.



5.	We have included the bond costs for the on-site public utility improvements.

6.	Due to a lack of ground water concerns, we have not included casing piers in our proposal. However, we may need to case all or some of the piers due to water injecting
the building pad. This will be handled on a per unit rate if required.



7.	We have provided building pad preparation as follows:



•	 	 Excavate to 5’-0” below building sub grade to a distance 5’-0” outside the building perimeter (10’-0” at all entrances).





•	 	 Water injection stabilization to a depth of 20’-0” below excavated grade (5 passes included). Additional passes will be handled on a per unit
rate if required.




•	 	 Moisture condition and re-compact excavated soils.




•	 	 Stabilize compacted soil with a mixture of 6% lime to a depth of 6” below grade.





8.	We have included chain link fences as 6’-0” tall in lieu of 8’-0” tall where shown.




9.	We have included vinyl privacy slats at the fence along the north and west sides of the gravel lay down yard.




10.	We have included V-groove rolling ornamental gates in lieu of cantilever gates due to the width of the proposed openings.




11.	We have included manually operated gates.



12.	We have included liner panels in the manufacturing space to 10’-0” AFF with exposed vinyl-faced batt insulation above.




13.	Specification 41 1213 does not identify the capacity required for the parts lift at the mezzanine. We have included an Auto-Quip VRC with the following specifications:




•	 	 Capacity: 6,000 lbs.




•	 	 Platform size: 8’-0” x 12’-0”




•	 	 Vertical rise: 15’-0”




•	 	 Load height: 10’-0”




•	 	 Upper and lower gates with safety interlocks




14.	We have included the compressed air loop and drops. All air compressors, dryers, gas tanks, gas loops and gas drops shall be provided and installed by the owner. We
have provided a $70,000 ALLOWANCE to be approved by the Owner under the “SCOPE MODIFICATIONS BY OWNER” heading above.



15.	Per Vince Hanlon’s directions, we have eliminated all scope and costs associated with FOCR #155 (Conditioned Workspace).




16.	We have made structural accommodations for the Owner provided and installed jib cranes.




17.	This proposal is valid for a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the date first indicated above. However, due to the volatility of the steel and copper
markets, Schwob Building Company reserves the right to review, withdraw, and/or amend this proposal after this time.



18.	The Construction Schedule is an estimated 336 calendar days (approximately 48 weeks). This duration is based on a Commencement Date of 10 days after receipt of all
applicable permits from the local governing authorities and an executed Owner/Contractor Agreement, whichever is greater.

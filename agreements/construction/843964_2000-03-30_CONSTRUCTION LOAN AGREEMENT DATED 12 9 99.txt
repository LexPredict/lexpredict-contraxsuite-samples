Borrower's acquisition cost of the Parcel for such Unit pursuant to the

of such excess.

(c) Borrower must make a mandatory principal payment

shall be due and payable to Lender on the first day of each month
commencing on the first day of the month following the month in which

during the term of the Loan to disburse to itself from the undisbursed
proceeds of the Loan all then accrued and unpaid interest on the Loan
which is then due and payable; provided, however, that such
authorization shall not be deemed to limit, reduce or otherwise affect
Borrower's obligation to pay interest if (a) there are no remaining
amounts in the Budget for the Loan allocated for the payment of such
interest (including Reserves specifically allocated to pay such
interest), or (b) Lender is entitled to withhold disbursement of the
Loan for any reason. Any amounts disbursed from the interest reserve
shall become part of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and

payment on the Loan equal to the aggregate amount of the Loan

under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and after the
Maturity Date (or the First Extended Maturity Date or the Second
Extended Maturity Date, if applicable), (a) the aggregate outstanding
principal balance of the Loan and any other amounts then owing by
Borrower to Lender shall bear interest at the Default Rate until paid
in full and (b) subject to the maximum rate permitted by Applicable
Law, all accrued but unpaid interest shall bear interest at the Default
Rate therefrom until paid in full.

3.8 Late Charge. If any payment of interest or principal due
under the Note is not made within ten days after such payment is due,
then, in addition to the payment of the amount so due, Borrower shall
pay to Lender a "late charge" equal to five percent (5.0%) of the
amount of that payment or $25.00, whichever is greater, up to the
maximum amount of $1,500.00 per late charge to compensate Lender for
the cost of collecting and handling such late payment. This late charge
may be assessed without notice, shall be immediately due and payable
and shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies available to
Lender.

Date.

deemed to be Spec Units or Model Units, Borrower shall have the right

reduced from 70% to 65% of the appraised value on the date

Retainage shall be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of
Section 5.11 below, and (b) in no event shall Lender be obligated to

items that are already established in the Budget, Lender may establish
and set aside out of the undisbursed proceeds of the Loan, reserves
(collectively, the "Reserves") in such amounts as may be reasonably
estimated by Lender from time to time to provide for payment of the
items of Project Cost as the same may accrue or become payable prior to
the repayment in full of the Loan. Amounts set aside as Reserves shall
not be available for disbursement to Borrower for any purpose other

Expenses, (ii) interest on the Loan, (iii) real estate taxes and
assessments, (iv) premiums on insurance policies and bonds (if any)

5.9      Loan In Balance.

(a) At all times prior to repayment of the Loan in full, (i)
the undisbursed proceeds from the Loan allocated to each line item in
the Budget (the aggregate amount of such proceeds being hereinafter
referred to as the "Available Proceeds") must be sufficient, in
Lender's reasonable determination, to pay the unpaid costs and expenses
that will be incurred to complete such item, and (ii) the aggregate
Available Proceeds must be sufficient, in Lender's reasonable
determination, to pay all Project Costs remaining unpaid and all
operating, management and other expenses of the Project through the
projected date on which all of the Units for which construction of
Improvements have commenced will be sold, as such date is determined by
Lender from time to time.

(b) If Lender determines that (i) the costs and expenses to
complete a Unit exceeds the amount allocated therefor, or (ii) the
Project Costs remaining unpaid and all estimated operating, management
and other expenses of the Project through the projected date on which
all of the Units for which construction of Improvements have commenced
will be sold, as such date is determined by Lender from time to time,
exceed the sum of the Available Proceeds, then the Loan shall be deemed
"out of balance" to the extent of such excess.

(c) If Lender deems the Loan to be out of balance as
aforesaid, Borrower shall, within five days after written request by
Lender, deposit with Lender an amount equal to the excess amount or
amounts determined pursuant to subparagraph (b) above of this Section.
The sums thus deposited with Lender will be disbursed by Lender to
complete the Work prior to any further disbursement of Loan proceeds
(or, if the Work has been completed, to the repayment of the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan). If such deposit is not made
within such time, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred.

Project Cost directly to the person or entity Lender determines is

in the performance of the Work, or for any debts or claims whatsoever
accruing in favor of any

19
<PAGE>

such parties and against Borrower or others, or against the Project. It
is expressly understood and agreed that Borrower is not and shall not
be an agent of Lender for any purpose whatsoever. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, advances made at Lender's option, directly
to any contractor, subcontractor or supplier of labor or materials, or
any other party, shall not be deemed a recognition by Lender of any
third party beneficiary status of any such person or entity.

(c) Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall receive all
advances of Loan proceeds to be made hereunder by Lender as a trust
fund and that Borrower shall withdraw and use said funds solely for the
payment of the bills for the labor and materials used in the
performance of the Work for which such Loan funds were requested by
Borrower, and for the payment of the other items of Project Cost for
which such Loan proceeds were requested by Borrower, and for no other
purpose whatsoever; however, nothing herein shall impose upon Lender
any obligation whatsoever to see to the proper application of any such
monies by Borrower.

(d) Whenever so requested by Lender, Borrower shall promptly
furnish Lender written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that
all monies theretofore advanced by Lender pursuant to this Agreement
have actually been paid or applied in payment of the cost of

access to and the right to inspect, audit and copy all books, records,
contracts and other documents and information relating to Borrower or
the Property. Lender shall use reasonable efforts to keep confidential
all information and documentation obtained by Lender in connection with
such audits and inspections, except to the extent that Lender
determines, in its reasonable discretion, a need to disclose same;

same in case of the filing of any claims for lien or proceedings for
the enforcement thereof; provided that in connection with any such lien
or claim which Borrower may in good faith desire to contest, Borrower
may contest the same by appropriate legal proceedings diligently
prosecuted, but only if Borrower shall furnish to the Title Company
such security or indemnity as the Title Company requires to induce the
Title Company to issue endorsements to the Title Policies insuring over
the exception created by such lien, and provided further, that Lender
shall not be required to make any further disbursements of a Loan until
any mechanics' lien claims have been so insured against by the Title
Company.

7.5 Release by Lender. With respect to the matters set forth

any asserted liens or claims, or (b) fail promptly to contest asserted
liens or claims or to give security or indemnity in the manner provided
in Section 7.4 above, or (c) having commenced to contest the same, and
having given such security or indemnity, fail to prosecute such contest
with diligence, or to maintain such indemnity or security so required
by the Title Company for its full amount, or (d) upon adverse
conclusion of any such contest, fail promptly to cause any judgment or
decree to be satisfied and lien to be released, then Lender may, but
shall not be required to, procure the release and discharge of any such
claim and any judgment or decree thereon and, further, may, in its sole
discretion, effect any settlement or compromise of the same, or may
furnish such security or indemnity to the Title Company, and any
amounts so expended by Lender, including premiums paid or security
furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds,
shall be deemed to constitute disbursements of the proceeds of the Loan
hereunder and shall bear interest from the date so disbursed until paid

senior or junior to or at parity with the Mortgage and Seller Mortgage.

7.9 Proceedings Affecting Property. If any proceedings are
filed seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent or declare invalid or
unlawful the occupancy, use, maintenance or operation of the Property,
or any portion thereof, Borrower shall cause such proceedings to be
vigorously contested in good faith, and in the event of an adverse
ruling or decision, prosecute all allowable appeals therefrom, and
shall, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, resist the
entry or seek the stay of any temporary or permanent injunction that
may be entered, and use its best efforts to bring about a favorable and
speedy disposition of all such proceedings. All such proceedings,
including without limitation, all of Lender's costs, and fees and
disbursements of Lender's counsel in connection with any such
proceedings, whether or not Lender is a party thereto, shall be at
Borrower's expense. To the extent that Lender incurs any such expenses,
including attorneys' fees and fees and charges for court costs, bonds
and the like, Borrower shall reimburse Lender for such expenses and the
amount due Lender shall bear interest from the date so incurred by
Lender until repaid to Lender at the Default Rate and shall be payable
to Lender on demand.

7.10 Disposal and Encumbrance of Property. Except as expressly
permitted pursuant to Article 12 below, Borrower shall not and shall
cause Seller not to, without Lender's prior written consent, suffer,
permit or enter into any agreement for any sale, lease, transfer, or in
any way encumber or dispose of or grant or suffer any security or other
assignment (collateral or otherwise) of or in all or any portion of the

this Section, shall not constitute a consent to, or waiver of any
right, remedy or power of Lender under any subsequent default
hereunder.

insurance policies required from time to time under this Agreement, and
thirty days prior to expiration of any such policies, Borrower shall
furnish to Lender, with premiums prepaid, additional and renewal
policies in form, and with companies, coverage, deductibles and amounts
satisfactory to Lender. In the event of failure by Borrower to provide
such insurance, Lender may, but shall not be required to, place
insurance and treat the amounts expended therefor as disbursements of
Loan proceeds and such amounts from the date so expended by Lender
until repaid to Lender shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

7.12 Performance of Obligations; Notice of Default. Borrower
shall promptly and fully perform and comply in all respects with the
obligations, terms, agreements, provisions and requirements of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and all other documents and
instruments relating thereto and will not permit to occur any default
or breach hereunder or thereunder. Borrower shall promptly give to
Lender notice of the occurrence of any Unmatured Default or of any

its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.

to the repayment of the Loan, (A) the Sole Member shall be the sole
member of Borrower; (B) Borrower shall not make or permit any
distributions of cash flow or cash proceeds to Sole Member or any
partner, subpartner, member, shareholder, officer, director or
affiliate of Borrower or Sole Member and all positive cash flow from

Principal Balance; (C) Borrower shall not enter into any contract or
agreement for the provision of services or otherwise with respect to
the Project with any partner, subpartner, member, shareholder, officer,
director or affiliate of any partner of Borrower or Sole Member unless
such contract or agreement is an arms-length, market rate agreement and
is cancelable upon thirty days written notice from any owner of the
Project; (D) neither Borrower nor Sole Member shall be dissolved or its
existence terminated; and (E) Borrower shall not own any other real
property other than the Project.

7.15 Use of Receipts. Borrower shall cause all rents and other
income and receipts realized and received by Borrower, if any, from and
in connection with the Project to be used for the purpose of paying the
actual costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in connection with the
ownership, operation, management and repair of the Project, including
without limitation, operating expenses, real estate taxes, insurance
premiums and interest and principal owing on the Loan.

7.16 Management and Leasing Agreements; Subordination.
Borrower shall not amend, extend, substitute or enter into any new
management or leasing agreement covering all or any portion of the
Property without Lender's prior written consent. In the event that
Lender grants such consent, Borrower shall cause the tenant, property

agreement with Lender, acceptable in form and substance to Lender,
pursuant to which said tenant, property manager or broker subordinates
its liens for unpaid fees to the liens of the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents.

record any document pertaining to, affecting or running with all or any
portion of the Property without the prior written approval of Lender of

7.18 Sale to Investors. Without the prior written consent of
Lender, which consent may be granted or denied at Lender's sole
discretion, Borrower shall not knowingly sell any Units to investors or
syndicators who are acquiring such Units with the intent to resell
them.

applicable lot, side, rear and set-back lines; and that there are no
encroachments by the improvements over easements or adjoining property.

Loan Expenses paid by Lender shall bear interest commencing on the date demand
for repayment thereof is made by Lender until repaid to Lender at the Default
Rate and shall be paid by Borrower upon demand, or may be paid by Lender at any

the right to engage personnel in connection with negotiation, documentation,

30
<PAGE>

such failure by its nature can be cured, then so long as the continued
operation and safety of the Property, and the priority, validity and
enforceability of the lien created by the Mortgage or any of the other
Loan Documents and the value of the Property are not imminently
impaired, threatened or jeopardized, then Borrower shall have a period
(the "Cure Period") of thirty days after written notice from Lender of
any such failure of performance or observance to cure or cause the cure
of the same, and an Event of Default shall not be deemed to exist
during the Cure Period, provided further that if Borrower commences to

faith attempting to effect such cure, the Cure Period shall be extended
until such failure is cured, but in no event shall the Cure Period be
longer than 90 days in the aggregate.

performed any obligation, or observe any condition, covenant, term,
agreement or provision required to be performed or observed by Borrower

Borrower or Seller of any reorganization, arrangement, composition,
readjustment, dissolution, liquidation or similar proceedings under any
present or future federal, state or other statute or law, or the
appointment of a receiver, trustee or other officer for all or any
substantial part of the property of Borrower or Seller which remains

financing, lien, encumbrance or other transaction made in violation of

31
<PAGE>

required by the terms of this Agreement, or of any proceedings which

Mortgage or any of the other security for the Loan, or which could
materially affect Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under

by any receiver, custodian or assignee for the benefit of creditors of

reasonable control of Borrower (it being understood that a delay caused
by an insufficiency of funds shall not be deemed to be beyond the
control of Borrower), or any delay in the Work, regardless of cause,

the Work to be performed in a manner which is materially contrary to

11. REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender, in
addition to availing itself of any remedies conferred upon it at law or in
equity and by the terms of the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents,
may pursue any one or more of the following remedies first, concurrently or
successively with each other and with any other available

32
<PAGE>

remedies, it being the intent hereof that none of such remedies shall be to the
exclusion of any others:

(a) Take possession of the Project and complete the Work and
do anything necessary or desirable in Lender's sole judgment to fulfill
the obligations of Borrower hereunder, including either the right to
avail itself of and procure performance of the Construction Contract,
any Subcontracts or any other contract entered into for the performance
of all or any portion of the Work (or any substitute therefor), or to
let new or additional contracts with the same contractors or
subcontractors or others, and to employ watchmen to protect the Project
from injury. Without restricting the generality of the foregoing and
for the purposes aforesaid, Borrower hereby appoints and constitutes
Lender its lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution (i)
to complete the Work in the name of Borrower upon an Event of Default;
(ii) to, upon an Event of Default, use portions of the Loan or other
funds which may be reserved, escrowed or set aside for any purposes
hereunder at any time to complete the Work; (iii) to, upon an Event of
Default, make changes in the Plans and Specifications which shall be
reasonably necessary or reasonably desirable to complete the Work; (iv)
to, upon an Event of Default, retain or employ new general contractors,
subcontractors, architects, engineers and inspectors as shall be
required for such purposes; (v) to, upon an Event of Default, pay,
settle or compromise all existing bills and claims, which may be liens
or security interests or to avoid such bills and claims becoming liens
or security interests against the Project, or as may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of the Work or for the clearance of title;
(vi) to, upon an Event of Default, execute all applications and
certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any of
the Loan Documents; (vii) to, upon an Event of Default, prosecute and
defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Work; (viii)
to, upon an Event of Default, take such action and require such
performance as it deems necessary under any of the bonds to be
furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof and to make settlements and
compromises with the surety or sureties thereunder, and in connection
therewith, to execute instruments of release and satisfaction; it being
understood that the foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an
interest and cannot be revoked. All sums expended by Lender pursuant to
this Article 11 shall be deemed to have been paid to Borrower and
secured by the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, and shall bear
interest at the Default Rate until repaid to Lender.

(b) Declare the unpaid indebtedness evidenced by the Note to
be immediately due and payable.

(c) Apply the balance of any deposits made with Lender toward
the repayment of the Loan.

(d) Withhold further disbursements of proceeds of the Loan.


33
<PAGE>

12.      SALES OF UNITS; PARTIAL RELEASES.

12.1 Sales Prices. Provided that no Event of Default or
Unmatured Default then exists under the Note, this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, Borrower shall have the right to enter into
and perform sales contracts with creditworthy third party purchasers of
the Units on the form contract submitted to Lender pursuant to Section
4.19 above, provided that (a) Lender has approved all sales materials
relating to the Units, (b) the consideration for any such sale consists
solely of cash, and (c) the gross sales price for any such Unit is not
less than the budgeted amount for the construction of Improvements plus
the cost paid or to be paid to Seller for the underlying Parcel for
such Unit.

12.2 Release Prices. Provided that all of the conditions
described in Section 12.1 above have been satisfied in form and
substance acceptable to Lender and no Event of Default or Unmatured
Default then exists, Lender will issue a partial release of the lien of
its Loan Documents covering any Unit upon the payment to Lender of an
amount equal to the amount of the Loan previously disbursed by Lender
with respect to such Unit.

13.      MISCELLANEOUS.

13.1 Additional Indebtedness. All advances or payments made by
Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
constitute indebtedness secured by the Mortgage and all other security
for the Loan, and all advances or payments made by Lender, except for
normal disbursements on the Loan, shall bear interest at the Default
Rate from the date advanced or paid until repaid to Lender by Borrower.

13.2 Additional Acts. Borrower shall, upon request, execute
and deliver such further instruments and documents and do such further
acts and things as may be reasonably required to provide to Lender the
evidence of and security for the Loan contemplated by this Agreement.

13.3 Loan Agreement Governs. In the event of any inconsistency
between any provision of this Agreement and any provision of any other
Loan Document, the provision of this Agreement shall govern; provided,
however, that the provisions of all of the Loan Documents shall be
construed as an integrated set of provisions governing the Loan and,
accordingly, shall be interpreted and construed liberally to give the
maximum validity, enforceability and effect to all of such provisions.


13.4 Additional Advances. If an Event of Default shall occur,
Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, take any and all actions to
cure such default, and all amounts expended in so doing, all Loan
Expenses and all other amounts paid or advanced by Lender pursuant to
the Loan Documents, and all other amounts advanced by Lender in
connection with the performance of the Work or preserving any security
for the Loan,

34
<PAGE>

shall constitute additional advances of the Loan, shall be secured by
the Mortgage and all other security for the Loan, and shall bear
interest at the Default Rate from the date advanced until paid.

13.5 Amendment; Waiver; Approval. This Agreement shall not be
amended, modified or supplemented without the written agreement of
Borrower and Lender at the time of such amendment, modification or
supplement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents shall be effective unless set forth in writing
signed by the party making such waiver, and any such waiver shall be
effective only to the extent therein set forth. Failure by Lender to
insist upon full and prompt performance of any provisions of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or to take action in the
event of any breach of any such provision or upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default, shall not constitute a waiver of any rights of
Lender, and Lender may at any time thereafter exercise all available
rights and remedies with respect to such breach or Event of Default.
Receipt by Lender of any instrument or document shall not constitute or
be deemed to be an approval thereof. Any approvals required under any
of the other Loan Documents must be in writing, signed by Lender and
directed to Borrower.

13.6 Notice. All notices, communications and waivers under
this Loan Agreement shall be in writing and shall be (i) delivered in

payment of all amounts due Lender under the Loan Documents and
performance and observance by Borrower of each covenant, agreement,
provision and term of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

13.13 Invalid Provisions. In the event that any provision of

Lender reserves the right to publicize the making of the Loan in any
manner it deems appropriate, including, without limitation,
advertisements in trade journals and newspapers. In addition, Borrower
agrees that Lender shall have the right to erect and maintain a sign at
the Project in a prominent location for the duration of the term of the

ANY COURT IN WHICH LENDER SHALL INITIATE SUCH ACTION AND WHICH HAS
JURISDICTION. BORROWER HEREBY EXPRESSLY SUBMITS AND CONSENTS IN ADVANCE
TO SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED BY LENDER IN
ANY OF SUCH COURTS, AND HEREBY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS

THAT SERVICE OF SUCH SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS OR PAPERS
MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL ADDRESSED TO BORROWER AT
THE ADDRESS TO WHICH NOTICES ARE TO BE SENT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT.
BORROWER WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT CHICAGO, ILLINOIS OR THE NORTHERN
DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM OR AN IMPROPER FORUM
BASED ON LACK OF VENUE. SHOULD BORROWER, AFTER BEING SO SERVED, FAIL TO
APPEAR OR ANSWER TO ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT, PROCESS OR PAPERS SO SERVED
WITHIN THE NUMBER OF DAYS PRESCRIBED BY LAW AFTER THE MAILING THEREOF,
BORROWER SHALL BE DEEMED IN DEFAULT AND AN ORDER AND/OR JUDGMENT MAY BE
ENTERED BY LENDER AGAINST BORROWER AS DEMANDED OR PRAYED FOR IN SUCH
SUMMONS, COMPLAINT, PROCESS OR PAPERS. THE EXCLUSIVE CHOICE OF FORUM
FOR BORROWER SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO PRECLUDE
THE ENFORCEMENT BY LENDER OF ANY JUDGMENT OBTAINED IN ANY OTHER FORUM
OR THE TAKING BY LENDER OF ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE THE SAME IN ANY OTHER
APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION, AND BORROWER HEREBY WAIVES THE RIGHT, IF ANY,
TO COLLATERALLY ATTACK ANY SUCH JUDGMENT OR ACTION.

Now, Therefore, in consideration of the AGREEMENT, and their mutual promises
made herein, BANK and BORROWER agree as follows:

FIXED RATE NOTE, VARIABLE RATE NOTE, and LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE described in
paragraph 3, below, commence on the same date as the CONSTRUCTION NOTE, which
is the 16th day of the calendar month. Therefore, effective
immediately, a new subparagraph 1.18.4 shall be added to Section 1.18 of the
AGREEMENT, so that such Section 1.18 shall read:

thereafter, and for the CONSTRUCTION NOTE, LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE and
REVOLVING NOTE ending one month thereafter; provided that:




1.18.1 subject to clauses 1.18.2 and 1.18.3 below, any INTEREST
PERIOD which would otherwise end on a day which is not a
EURODOLLAR BUSINESS DAY shall be extended to the next succeeding
EURODOLLAR BUSINESS DAY unless such EURODOLLAR BUSINESS DAY falls in
another calendar month, in which case such INTEREST PERIOD shall end on the
immediately preceding EURODOLLAR BUSINESS DAY;




1.18.2 subject to clause 1.18.3 below, any INTEREST PERIOD which
begins on the last EURODOLLAR BUSINESS DAY of a calendar month
(or a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the
calendar month at the end of such INTEREST PERIOD) shall end on the last
EURODOLLAR BUSINESS DAY of a calendar month;




















1.18.3 no INTEREST PERIOD shall extend beyond the LOAN
TERMINATION DATE; and




1.18.4 Notwithstanding anything hereinabove to the contrary, the
INTEREST PERIOD for the REVOLVING NOTE, FIXED RATE NOTE,
VARIABLE RATE NOTE, LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE and the
CONSTRUCTION NOTE shall commence on the 16th day of the calendar
month.

asserted by Agent, Lessee or Guarantor against Beneficiary, (d) any attempt to
collect from Agent, Lessee or any other entity or to perfect or enforce any
security or (e) any other action, occurrence or circumstance whatsoever which
might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable
discharge of, Agent, Lessee or Guarantor. Guarantor waives any requirement that
Beneficiary shall have instituted any suit, action or proceeding or exhausted
its remedies or taken any steps to enforce any rights against Agent, Lessee or
any other Person or entity to compel any such performance or to collect all or
any part of such amount pursuant to the provisions of the Operative Agreements
or at law or in equity, or otherwise.

any of the Obligations made by Beneficiary may be rescinded by Beneficiary and

provided that the specific enumeration of the above-mentioned acts, failures or
omissions shall not be deemed to exclude any other acts, failures or omissions,
that are not specifically mentioned above, it being the purpose and intent of
this paragraph that the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be discharged, impaired or varied except by the
payment, observance or performance to Beneficiary of Agent's and Lessee's
obligations under the Operative Agreements, and then only to the extent of such
payments, observance or performance.

In order to hold Guarantor liable hereunder, there shall be no
obligation on the part of Beneficiary at any time to enforce or attempt to
enforce any right or remedy against Agent or Lessee or to resort to any
collateral, property or estates or any other rights or remedies whatsoever.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that repeated and successive
demands may be made and recoveries may be had hereunder but without duplication
of payment as and when, from time to time, Agent or Lessee shall default under
the terms of any of the Operative Agreements and that notwithstanding the
recovery hereunder for or in respect of any given default by Agent or Lessee
under any of the Operative Agreements, this Guaranty shall remain in full force
and effect and shall apply to each and every subsequent default. Each and every
default in any payment, observance or performance of any Obligation of Agent or
Lessee under the Operative Agreements shall give rise to a separate claim and
cause of action hereunder, and, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, separate
claims or suits may be made and brought, as the case may be, hereunder as each
such default occurs.

SECTION 2.05 Waiver by Guarantor. Guarantor unconditionally
waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, any and
all (a) notices of the acceptance of this Guaranty by Beneficiary and of any
change in the financial condition of Agent; (b) notices of the creation,
renewal, extension or accrual of any Obligation or any of the matters referred
to in Section 2.04 or any notice of or proof of reliance by Beneficiary upon
this Guaranty or acceptance of this Guaranty (the Obligations, and any of them,
shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted, incurred,
renewed, extended, amended or waived in reliance upon this Guaranty and all
dealings between Agent, Lessee or Guarantor and Beneficiary shall be
conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this
Guaranty); (c) notices which may be required by statute, rule of law or
otherwise, now or hereafter in effect, to preserve intact any rights of any of
Beneficiary against Guarantor; (d) right to interpose all substantive and
procedural defenses of the law of guaranty, indemnification and suretyship,
except the defense of prior payment or prior performance by Guarantor, Agent,
Lessee or otherwise of the Obligations; (e) all rights, defenses and remedies
accorded by Applicable Laws to guarantors or sureties, including any extension
of time conferred by any law now or hereafter in effect; (f) right or claim of
right to cause a marshaling of the assets of Agent or Lessee or to cause
Beneficiary to proceed against Agent or Lessee or any collateral held by
Beneficiary at any time or in any particular order; (g) rights to the
enforcement, assertion or






14
<PAGE>

exercise by Beneficiary of any right, power, privilege or remedy conferred
herein or in any Operative Agreement or otherwise, except as specified in the
Operative Agreements; (h) requirements of promptness or diligence on the part of
Beneficiary; (i) notices of the sale, transfer or other disposition of any
right, title to or interest in any Operative Agreement; (j) demand of payment by
Beneficiary or any other Person from Agent or any other Person indebted or in
any manner liable on or for the Obligations hereby guaranteed; (k) presentment
for payment by Beneficiary or any other Person of the Obligations, protest
thereof and notice of dishonor to any party; or (l) other circumstances
whatsoever (except the defense of prior payment or prior performance by
Guarantor, Agent, Lessee or otherwise of the Obligations) which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge, release or defense of a guarantor or
surety, or which might otherwise limit recourse against Guarantor.

SECTION 2.06 Payments; Taxes. (a) All payments hereunder shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available United States dollar funds to
such account at such financial institution as Beneficiary may from time to time
designate in writing.

(b) All payments by Guarantor shall be made free and clear of
and without deduction for any and all present or future Impositions. If
Guarantor shall be required by Applicable Law to deduct any Impositions from or
in respect of any amounts payable hereunder, (i) the amounts payable shall be
increased by the amount necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
2.06), the recipient shall receive an amount equal on an After-Tax-Basis to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Guarantor
shall make such deductions, and (iii) Guarantor shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority in
accordance with all Applicable Laws. Within 15 days after the date of any
deduction of any Imposition, Guarantor will furnish to the relevant Person, the
Agent and the Trustee, the original or a certified copy of a receipt or other
documentation evidencing payment thereof as is reasonably acceptable to such
recipient.

(c) Each of the Operative Agreements has been entered into on
the basis of the intention set forth in Section 15.1 of the Construction Agency
Agreement, Section 10.17 of the Credit Agreement and Section 25.1 of the Lease.
The Guarantor agrees and covenants that it shall not (unless required to do so
under Applicable Law) file any tax return, statement or schedule or take any
action inconsistent with such treatment.

(d) All obligations of Guarantor pursuant to this Section 2.06
shall survive the expiration, cancellation or termination of this Guaranty.

SECTION 2.07 Reinstatement. This Guaranty shall continue to be
effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, in
whole or in part, of any of the Obligations is invalidated, voided, declared to
be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, rescinded or must otherwise be repaid,
restored or returned to a trustee, receiver or any other Person by Beneficiary
upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,





15
<PAGE>

composition, dissolution, liquidation, or the like, of Agent, Lessee or
Guarantor, or as a result of, the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee
or other officer with similar powers with respect to Agent, Lessee or Guarantor
or any substantial part of such Person's respective property, or otherwise, all
as though such payment had not been made notwithstanding any termination of this
Guaranty or any Operative Agreement.

aggregate, is less than $100,000,000; and (C) such other information
relating to Guarantor or its business, properties, condition and




17
<PAGE>

operations as Beneficiary (or Lender Agent or Collateral Agent through
Beneficiary) may reasonably request; and

(v) any change in the Corporate Rating by any Rating Agency,
or the issuance by an additional Rating Agency of a Corporate Rating,
promptly upon the effectiveness of such change or issuance.

Information required to be delivered pursuant to the foregoing Sections
3.01(a)(i), (ii), and (iv)(A) shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date
on which such information has been posted on the SEC website on the Internet at
sec.gov/edgar/searches.htm or at another website identified by the Guarantor in
writing to the Administrative Agent and accessible by Beneficiary, any
Certificate Participant, any Lender or any other Secured Party without charge;
provided that if any Lender, Certificate Participant or any other Secured Party
requests delivery of such information, Guarantor shall deliver paper copies of
such information to Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent as appropriate
(who shall deliver copies to the requesting Lender or Certificate Participant).

(b) Existence; Laws. Guarantor will and will cause each
Subsidiary of Guarantor to, do or cause to be done all things necessary (i) to
preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and
all rights, licenses, permits and franchises and (ii) to comply with all laws
and regulations applicable to it, in each case where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Guarantor.

(c) Access. At any reasonable time and from time to time (but
no more often than once each calendar year if no Default has occurred and is
continuing), Guarantor will permit up to three representatives of Lenders
designated by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, in each case
acting jointly, on not less than five Business Days' notice, to examine and make
copies of and abstracts from the records and books of account of, and visit the
properties of, Guarantor and to discuss the general business affairs of
Guarantor with its officers and independent certified public accountants;
subject, however, in all cases to the imposition of such conditions as Guarantor
shall deem necessary based on reasonable considerations of safety and security;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.1 of the
Credit Agreement (or the comparable provision of any other Financing Document),
Section 12.1 of the Construction Agency Agreement and Section 22.1 of the Lease,
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, as the case may be, assume sole
responsibility for the condition of any Property of Guarantor so visited and
inspected, the access and egress thereto, and any hazard or defect therein or
thereon, and assume all responsibility for and hereby release and indemnify
Guarantor and its Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, and
agents against any claim for damage or injury to or by such representatives or
to Guarantor's Property which may be occasioned by inspection and visitation of
Guarantor's Property; provided, further, however, that neither Guarantor nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to disclose to Administrative Agent and
any Lender, or any agents or representatives thereof any information which is
the subject of attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product privilege
properly asserted by the






18
<PAGE>

applicable Person to prevent the loss of such privilege in connection with such
information or which is prevented from disclosure pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with third parties. The expense of any exercise by the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent and the Lenders of their rights under this Section
3.01(c) shall be for the account of the Collateral Agent and the Lenders, as
applicable unless a Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of the
request or visit.

(d) Insurance. Guarantor will and will cause each Subsidiary
to, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies or
associations, or to the extent that Guarantor or such Subsidiary deems it
prudent to do so, through its own program of self-insurance, in such amounts and
covering such risks as is usually carried by companies engaged in similar
businesses, of comparable size and financial strength and with comparable risks,
except where failure to so maintain insurance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(e) Use of Proceeds. Guarantor will cause Agent to use the
proceeds of any Advance Payments made or issued by the Owner Trust to it for the
purposes set forth in the Construction Agency Agreement, and not use the
proceeds of any Advance Payments made or issued by the Owner Trust for any
purpose that would violate the provisions of the Construction Agency Agreement.
Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to engage
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying, within the meaning of
Regulation U, any Margin Stock.

(f) Maintenance of Properties. Guarantor will preserve and
maintain, and will cause each Significant Subsidiary to preserve and maintain,
all of its Property that is material to the conduct of its business and keep the
same in good repair, working order and condition, and from time to time make, or
cause to be made, such repairs, renewals and replacements thereto as in the good
faith judgment of Guarantor are necessary or proper so that the business carried
on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times, in each case
unless failing to take the actions described above would not result in a
Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 3.01(f)
shall prevent (i) Guarantor from selling, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
any Properties (including the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of Guarantor), the
retention of which in the good faith judgment of Guarantor is inadvisable or
unnecessary to the business of Guarantor or (ii) any other transaction that is
expressly permitted by the terms of any other provision of this Guaranty,
including, but not limited to, any transaction permitted under Section 3.02(b).

(g) Pari Passu Debt. Guarantor will assure that the
obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall at all times rank at least
pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated Debt of Guarantor (other
than Debt which is mandatorily preferred by laws or regulations of general
application).




19
<PAGE>

SECTION 3.02 Negative Covenants. Guarantor further covenants
and agrees as follows:

(a) Financial Ratio. Guarantor will not permit the ratio of
(i) Consolidated Net Debt to (ii) the sum of Consolidated Shareholders' Equity,
Consolidated Net Debt, and Subordinated Affiliate Debt to exceed 0.6 to 1.0.

Guarantor will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets other than to one of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Consolidation or Merger. Guarantor will not consolidate
with, or merge into, or amalgamate with or into any other Person unless (i) both
before and after giving effect to such merger or consolidation, there exists no
Default or Guaranty Event of Default and (ii) either (A) Guarantor is the
surviving Person or (B) if Guarantor is not the surviving Person, the surviving
Person shall be incorporated or organized under the laws of the District of
Columbia or a state of the United States of America and shall expressly assume
in writing in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Beneficiary all of
the liabilities and obligations of Guarantor hereunder.

(d) Liens. Guarantor will not and will not permit any
Significant Subsidiary of Guarantor to, create, incur, or suffer to exist any
Lien in, of or on the Property of Guarantor or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, except Permitted Liens.

would otherwise have.

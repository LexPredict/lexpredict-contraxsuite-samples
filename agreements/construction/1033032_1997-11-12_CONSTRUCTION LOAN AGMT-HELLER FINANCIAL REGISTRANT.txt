CONSTRUCTION LOAN AGREEMENT

THIS CONSTRUCTION LOAN AGREEMENT, dated November 5, 1997, is
made by and  between HELLER FINANCIAL, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Lender"),
and SILVERLEAF RESORTS, INC., a Texas corporation ("Borrower"), in respect of a
revolving construction loan as set forth herein. All capitalized terms used
herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Appendix attached hereto
and made a part hereof by this reference.

SECTION 1 ADVANCES OF THE LOAN

1.1     COMMITMENT OF LENDER; ADVANCES.

a.       Construction Loan. Provided the conditions precedent
to an Advance have been satisfied and there exists no Default or Event of
Default, and further provided that the outstanding principal balance of the
Construction Loan shall not exceed the maximum amount set forth in Section 1.2
below, Lender will make Advances to Borrower as follows:

(i)       Advance Request Procedures. From time to
time, Borrower shall submit an Application for an Advance to Lender requesting
an Advance under the Construction Loan for the reimbursement of payment of
costs of labor, materials, and services supplied for the construction of a
particular Building and related facilities including landscaping, parking and
utility services ("Related Facilities"), as specified in the Approved Budget
for such Building.  Borrower shall not submit Applications for an Advance more
than two times per month nor more frequently than once per week, and each
Application for Advance shall be for an amount not less than Seventy Five
Thousand Dollars and No/100 ($75,000.00). Each Advance shall be issued by
Lender within ten (10) days of Lender's receipt of Borrower's Application for
Advance, provided Borrower is in compliance with conditions to such Advance set
forth herein. In addition to the conditions set forth below, Lender's
obligation to make Advances shall be subject to the receipt by Lender, on a
monthly basis, of reports from Lender's Inspecting Architects/Engineers
certifying that the Building(s) are on schedule under the Approved Completion
Schedule(s) and are in compliance with the Approved Budget(s) and the Plans, as
applicable.

(ii)      Limitations on Advances. Advances shall be
determined on a Building-by-Building basis, shall be limited to the amounts
shown in corresponding line items in the Approved Budget for each Building,
shall be limited to no more than four (4) Advances for each Building
corresponding to the Development Stages as shown on Exhibit "K", shall be
limited to the maximum amounts designated for each Development Stage and shall
not exceed





<PAGE>   7
in the aggregate for any single Building (A) eighty seven percent (87%) of (1)
the costs of labor, materials, and services incorporated into such Building or
the Related Facilities in a manner acceptable to Lender, plus (2) the purchase
price of all uninstalled materials to be utilized in the construction of the
Building or the Related Facilities and to be stored on the Property, less (B)
all prior Advances for payment of costs of labor, materials, and services for
the construction of the Building or the Related Facilities. Lender shall not be
obligated to make an Advance on any Building if at any time or pursuant to the
making of such Advance, (i) the outstanding principal balance of the promissory
note given by Borrower to Lender pursuant to the Interval Receivables Loan when
added to the amount representing eighty seven percent (87%) of the Approved
Budgets for all Buildings Lender has committed to make Advances upon that have
not been repaid would exceed Fifty Million Dollars and No/100 ($50,000,000.00)
or (ii) if the sum of eighty seven percent (87%) of the Approved Budget for any
Building upon which an Advance is sought when added to eighty seven percent
(87%) of the Approved Budgets for all Buildings for which Lender is either
committed to make an Advance upon or for which Lender has made an Advance or
Advances upon that have not been completely repaid exceeds $10,000,000.00. The
Advances under the Construction Loan shall be drawn by Borrower within eighteen
(18) months of the date hereof.

1.2     MAXIMUM CONSTRUCTION LOAN BALANCE. Unless the Lender, in its
sole and absolute discretion, elects otherwise, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Loan Agreement or the Loan Documents, the
outstanding principal balance of the Construction Note (including all Advances)
shall never exceed Ten Million Dollars and No/100 ($10,000,000.00) in the
aggregate, and shall not exceed the amount of Five Million Dollars and No/100
($5,000,000.00) outstanding at any single Resort at any one time. Borrower
hereby agrees to pay a fee of 1.0% (one percent) for each dollar advanced
(without regard to repayment) to Borrower which in the aggregate exceeds Ten
Million Dollars and No/100 ($10,000,000.00) under this Loan Agreement.

1.3     INTEREST. Interest on the Loan, at the rate or rates specified
in the Construction Note, shall be computed on the unpaid principal balance
which exists from time to time and shall be computed with respect to each
Advance only from the date of such Advance. Such interest on the Loan shall be
paid by Borrower to Lender on a monthly basis as provided in the applicable
note. As a courtesy, Lender's practice is to send out monthly billing
statements on or about the twentieth (20th) day of the month prior to the month
in which such payment is due; however, the failure of Lender to send out such a
billing statement shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation to pay interest
in accordance with the applicable notes.

1.4     TERM OF LOAN. The Construction Loan, together with all
interest thereon and all other sums due and owing Lender hereunder or under any
of the Loan Documents, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

written request from Borrower. As a condition to any such approval, Lender may
require, in its sole discretion, confirmation satisfactory to Lender of the
cost increase, if any, which would result from performance of the work
contemplated under such change. If it appears that performance of such work
shall result in such an increase, Lender may, in its sole discretion, condition
its approval upon a Borrower's Deposit of the amount of such increase or other
evidence satisfactory to Lender in its discretion that Borrower has the funds
necessary to provide for such cost increase.

1.9     NO WAIVER. No Advance shall constitute a waiver of any
condition precedent to the obligation of Lender to make any further Advance or
preclude Lender from thereafter declaring the failure of Borrower to satisfy
such condition precedent to be an Event of Default.

Borrower hereby represents and warrants as follows:

2.1     BORROWER EXISTENCE. Borrower is a corporation, duly formed,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas and

ability of Borrower to complete its obligation under the Loan Documents or
which involve





<PAGE>   15
the validity, enforceability, or priority of any of the Loan Documents, at law
or in equity. Borrower covenants to disclose in writing to Lender any event or
occurrence which causes the foregoing representation and warranty to no longer
be true upon Borrower's gaining knowledge of such event or occurrence.

2.4     VALID AND BINDING OBLIGATION, NO BREACH OR DEFAULT. All of the
Loan Documents, and all other documents referred to herein to which Borrower is
a party, upon execution and delivery will constitute valid and binding
obligations of Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their terms except as
limited by Debtor Relief Laws. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and the performance of any of the terms and conditions
hereof and of the other Loan Documents, will not result in a breach of, or
constitute a default in Borrower's organizational documents or in any mortgage,
deed of trust, lease, promissory note, loan agreement, credit agreement,
partnership agreement, or other agreement to which Borrower is a party or by
which Borrower may be bound or affected. To the best of its knowledge, Borrower
is not in default of any order of any court or any requirement of any
Governmental Authority.

2.5     TITLE TO THE PROPERTY. Borrower holds full legal and equitable
title to the Property, subject only to the Permitted Exceptions.

2.6     DISCLOSURE. There is no fact of which Borrower is aware that
Borrower has not disclosed to Lender in writing that could materially adversely
affect the property, business or financial condition of Borrower or the
Property. Borrower has furnished Lender with a true and complete copy of all
documents relating to construction of the Buildings.

2.7     SYSTEM COMPLIANCE. The storm and sanitary sewer system, water
system, all mechanical systems of the Property and other parts of the
Improvements do (or when constructed will) comply with all applicable
environmental, pollution control and ecological laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations, and all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction of the
Property have issued or to the best of Borrower's knowledge will issue all
necessary permits, licenses or other authorizations for the construction of the
Buildings (specifically including the named systems).

2.8     SUBMITTALS. The Loan Documents and all Financial Statements,
Plans, budgets, schedules, opinions, certificates, confirmations, contractor's
statements, applications, rent rolls, affidavits, agreements, Construction
Contract and other materials submitted to the Lender in connection with or in
furtherance of the Loan Documents by or on behalf of the Borrower fully and
fairly state in all material respects the matters with which they purport to
deal, and neither misstate any material fact, nor, separately or in the
aggregate, fail to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
made not misleading; provided, however, that such





<PAGE>   16
representation and warranty is made to the best of Borrower's knowledge with
respect to such materials submitted to Lender which were prepared by parties
other than Borrower or its employees.

2.9     UTILITY AVAILABILITY. All utility and municipal services
required for the construction, occupancy and operation of the Buildings and
Units, including, but not limited to, water supply, storm and sanitary sewer
systems, electric and telephone facilities, are available for use and tap-on at
the boundaries of the Property and will be available in sufficient amounts for
the normal and intended use of the Buildings and Units, and written permission
has been or will be obtained from the applicable utility companies or
municipalities to connect the Buildings and Units into each of said services.

2.10    GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENTS. The Property, the Buildings and the
Units are and at all times during the Loan will be constructed, operated and
sold in compliance with all zoning requirements, building codes, subdivision
improvement agreements, licensing requirements, all covenants, conditions and
restrictions of record, and all other Governmental Requirements and there are
no Governmental Requirements prohibiting the use and operation of the Property
for timeshare purposes. The zoning and subdivision approval of the Property and
the right and ability to construct, use or operate the Buildings are not in any
way dependent on or related to any real estate other than the Property. To
Borrower's knowledge, there are no, nor are there any alleged or asserted,
violations of Governmental Requirements, law, regulations, ordinances, codes,
permits, licenses, declarations, covenants, conditions, or restrictions of
record, or other agreements relating to the Property, the Buildings, the Units
or any part thereof. Borrower has obtained or is not aware of reasons why it
cannot obtain all necessary permits, licenses, consents and approvals to
develop and operate the Property as a timeshare project in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement and to sell the Interval Units in full
compliance with applicable law.

2.11    PROPERTY ACCESS. The Property has adequate access through
fully improved private or dedicated roads.

The representation and warranty made in this Section 2.13 shall remain true
throughout the term of the Loan.

2.14    OTHER LIENS AND ASSIGNMENTS. Borrower has not placed nor
permitted to be placed, nor will Borrower during the term of the Loan place nor
permit to be placed, upon any of the Property or any Resort, any first lien,
pledge or collateral assignment that encumbers an entire Resort or any
assignment of management contracts or any other contracts concerning the
operations of an entire Resort to any other lender extending a credit facility
or loan to Borrower for construction of new Interval Units, nor will Borrower,
for so long as Lender has a mortgage on a Building, pledge to any other lender
a security interest in any Notes Receivable, Deeds of Trust, purchase and sale
contracts, contracts for deed or any other receivable generated from the sale
of Interval Units in such Building.

2.15    INDUCEMENT TO LENDER. The representations and warranties in
this Section 2 and the covenants and agreements of Borrower set forth in
Section 3 below and contained in the Loan Documents are made by Borrower as an
inducement to Lender to make the Loan and Borrower understands that Lender is
relying on such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements which
shall be true and correct at all times while the Loan is outstanding and shall
survive any (a) bankruptcy proceedings involving Borrower or the Property, or
(b) foreclosure of the Mortgage, or (c) conveyance of title to the Property to
the Lender in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage.

Acceptance of each Advance constitutes reaffirmation, as of the date of such
acceptance, of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
Borrower in the Loan Documents except as disclosed in the Affidavit of Borrower
(if accepted by Lender), on which Lender shall rely in making such Advance.

SECTION 3 COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF BORROWER

Borrower hereby covenants and agrees as follows:

3.1     MANDATORY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. Borrower shall pay Lender the
Unit Release Payment for each Unit no later than the date upon which such Unit
is Released into the Timeshare Inventory, but in no event shall the Unit
Release Payment for a particular Unit be paid to Lender later than eighteen
(18) months from the commencement of construction of the Building within which
such Unit is located, which payments shall be applied under the Loan as set
forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Commencing with the first month
after the commencement of construction of a Building, no later than the tenth
(10th) day of each month thereafter, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a sales
report for each Resort within which Lender is providing Advances for

<PAGE>   18
any such Building, including any sales which occur prior to the completion of
construction of such Building, which sales report shall be certified by
Borrower as accurate. On or before the fifteenth (15th) day and the last day of
each month, Lender shall provide Borrower with partial releases from the lien
of the Mortgage for each Unit for which Lender has been paid the applicable
Unit Release Payment at least five (5) days prior to such date.

a.       Borrower shall commence construction of the Buildings
on or before the date set forth for commencement of construction in the
Approved Construction Schedule and the construction of each Building shall be
prosecuted with diligence and continuity, in a good and workmanlike manner, and
in accordance with sound building and engineering practices, all applicable
Governmental Requirements, the Plans, the Approved Budget, the Approved
Construction Schedule, and shall comply with all covenants, conditions and
restrictions affecting the Property. Borrower shall not permit cessation of
work for a period in excess of thirty (30) days without the written consent of
Lender (unless such cessation is caused by strike, riot, shortage of materials
or acts of God, in which case such cessation shall not exceed sixty (60) days),
and shall complete construction of each Building on or before the applicable
Building Completion Date, free and clear of all liens other than the Permitted
Exceptions and the Loan Documents (except those as to which Borrower has
furnished a bond or other security acceptable to Lender and otherwise complied
with the requirements of Section 3.17 below).

b.       Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally, and
irrevocably guarantees the completion of construction of each Building upon
which an Advance is made, and such guaranty (i) is independent of Borrower's
obligations under the Note, (ii) shall expressly survive foreclosure of any
Mortgage, and (iii) shall not be impaired or affected by any renewals or
extensions for payment of interest or principal under the Note or any
forbearance or delay in collecting interest or principal under the Note, or by
any waiver by Lender under the Mortgage or any other Loan Documents, or by
Lender's failure or election not to pursue any other remedies it may have
against Borrower, or by any change or modification in the Note, Mortgage or any
other Loan Documents, or by the acceptance by Lender of any additional security
or any increase, substitution or change therein, or by the release by Lender of
any security or any withdrawal thereof or decrease therein. Lender may at any
time enter into agreements with





<PAGE>   19
Borrower to amend and modify the Note, Mortgage or other Loan Documents, and
may waive or release any provision or provisions of the Note, Mortgage and
other Loan Documents, and, with reference to such instruments, may make and
enter into any such agreement or agreements as Lender and Borrower may deem
proper and desirable, without in any manner impairing or affecting Borrower's
completion guaranty or any of Lender's rights hereunder.

c.       If for any reason or under any contingency (i)
Borrower shall abandon construction of any Building upon which an Advance has
been made, (ii) Borrower shall fail to complete any Building in accordance with
the Approved Construction Schedule, Governmental Requirements and the Approved
Budget and in the manner provided in, and in accordance with the terms of, this
Loan Agreement, and pay all costs thereof, (iii) Lender takes possession of the
any Building prior to the completion of construction by reason of any default
of Borrower under any Loan Document, or, (iv) the right of Borrower to receive
any other or further Advances under any Loan Document shall be terminated in
accordance with the terms thereof, then, in any such event, Lender shall have
the right, but no obligation, to enter into possession of such Building or
Buildings and take all actions necessary in Lender's opinion to effect the
completion of such Building or Buildings and, at Borrower's cost and expense,
to cause the Building or Buildings to be fully completed and to pay all costs
and expenses in connection with the construction of such Building or Buildings.
Notwithstanding the above, Lender, at Lender's sole option, shall have the
right to complete such Buildings with changes or modifications in the plans and
specifications therefor which Lender reasonably deems necessary for the
completion of such Buildings, and expend such sums as Lender deems proper in
order to complete such Buildings. The amount of any and all expenditures made
by Lender shall be immediately due and payable by Borrower to Lender.

3.4     CORRECTION OF DEFECTS. Borrower shall correct or cause to be
corrected (a) any defect in the Buildings, (b) any material departure in the
construction of the Buildings from the Plans, (c) any violation of any
Governmental Requirements, or any violation of any covenants, conditions and
restrictions affecting the Property, if applicable, and (d) any encroachment by
any part of the Buildings, or any structure located on the Property, on any
easement, property line, or restricted area, or any encroachment by any such
structure on any building setback line.

3.5     STORAGE OF MATERIALS. Borrower shall cause all materials
supplied for, or intended to be utilized in, the construction of the Buildings,
but not affixed to or incorporated into the Buildings or the Property, to be
stored on the Property, with adequate safeguards, as reasonably required by
Lender, to prevent loss, theft, damage, or commingling with other materials or
projects.





<PAGE>   20
3.6     INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY AND BOOKS AND RECORDS. Borrower
shall permit Lender, and its agents and representatives, to enter upon the
Property and any location where materials intended to be utilized in the
construction of the Buildings are stored, for the purpose of inspection of the
Property and such materials at all reasonable times.  Borrower shall permit
Lender at all reasonable times, upon five (5) days advance written notice to
Borrower, to examine and copy the books and records of Borrower pertaining to
the Loan and the Property, and all sales and marketing records, contracts,
statements, invoices, bills, and claims for labor, materials, and services
supplied for the construction of the Buildings.

3.7     CASUALTY, CONDEMNATION. Borrower shall promptly notify Lender
of any fire or other casualty or any notice of taking or eminent domain action
or proceeding affecting the Property, or the threat of any such action or
proceeding of which Borrower becomes aware. Provided no Event of Default then
exists and Borrower certifies as to same, the net insurance proceeds shall be
paid to Lender but shall be made available by Lender for the restoration or
repair of the Property if: (i) in Lender's reasonable judgment (a) restoration
or repair and the continued operation of the Resort is economically feasible,
and (b) the value of Lender's security is not reduced; (ii) the cost of
restoration or repair does not exceed the net insurance proceeds or Borrower or
the Association shall provide a Borrower's Deposit or other evidence
satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion that Borrower or the Association
can pay all costs of restoration in excess of such net insurance proceeds;
(iii) the loss does not occur in the six (6) month period preceding the
Maturity Date as defined in the Construction Note; (iv) Borrower has sufficient
business interruption insurance to provide alternative accommodations for all
owners or users entitled to occupancy at the Project affected by such casualty
loss; and (v) Lender's Inspecting Architect/Engineers certify that the
restoration of the Property can be completed at least ninety (90) days prior to
the Maturity Date. Borrower or the Association shall pay all amounts, in
addition to the net insurance proceeds, necessary to pay in full the cost of
the restoration or repair.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be a condition precedent to
any disbursement of insurance proceeds held by Lender hereunder that Lender
shall have approved (x) all plans and specifications for any proposed repair or
restoration; (y) the construction schedule; and (z) the architect's and general
contractor's contracts for restoration.  Lender may establish other conditions
it deems reasonably necessary to assure the work is fully completed in a good
and workmanlike manner free of all liens or claims by reason thereof, and in
compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. At Lender's option,
the net insurance proceeds shall be disbursed pursuant to a construction escrow
acceptable to Lender. If an Event of Default then exists, or any of the
conditions set forth in this subsection have not been met or satisfied, the net
insurance proceeds (after deduction of Lender's reasonable costs and expenses,
if any, in collecting same) shall be applied to the Loan in such order and
manner as Lender may elect, whether or not due and payable, with any excess
paid to Borrower.





<PAGE>   21
The proceeds of any award, payment or claim for damages, direct or
consequential, in connection with any condemnation or other taking of any
Building or any portion of the Property, or for conveyances in lieu of
condemnation, are hereby assigned to and shall be paid to Lender. Lender is
authorized (but is under no obligation) to collect any such proceeds. The
proceeds of any such award shall be made available by Lender for repair or
restorations of the Property in the same manner and upon the same conditions as
those set forth above for net insurance proceeds.

Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, for so long as any
part of the Property is subject to the Declaration of CCRs, any and all
insurance proceeds arising from any damage or destruction to any part of the
Property and any and all awards and payments with respect to condemnation or
conveyances in lieu thereof received by Lender shall be delivered and paid out
by Lender to any insurance trustee under the Declaration of CCRs, to be
distributed and used in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of
CCRs.

3.8     APPLICATION OF ADVANCES. Borrower shall apply all Advances for
reimbursement of costs and expenses specified in the Approved Budget, and for
no other purpose.

3.9     BORROWER'S DEPOSIT. In accordance with Sections 1.8 and 3.7
above, Lender may require a Borrower's Deposit to be made which Lender shall
place in an interest bearing account and disburse in accordance with Sections
1.8 or 3.7 as applicable.

3.10    DIRECT DISBURSEMENT AND APPLICATION BY LENDER. Upon an Event
of Default, Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, to disburse
and directly apply the proceeds of any Advance or the unadvanced balance of the
Loan to the satisfaction of any of Borrower's obligations hereunder or under
any of the other Loan Documents. Any Advance by Lender for such purpose, except
Borrower's Deposit, shall be part of the Loan and shall be secured by the Loan
Documents. Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to hold, use, disburse, and apply
the Loan and the Borrower's Deposit, if any, for payment of costs of
construction of the Buildings, reasonable expenses incident to the Loan and the
Property, and the payment or performance of any obligation of Borrower
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents.  Borrower hereby assigns
and pledges the proceeds of the Loan and the Borrower's Deposit to Under for
such purposes. Upon an Event of Default, Lender may advance and incur such
Costs as Lender reasonably deems necessary for the completion of construction
of the Buildings and to preserve the Property, and any other security for the
Loan, and such Costs, even though in excess of the amount of the Loan, shall be
secured by the Loan Documents and payable to Lender.

the Loan Documents, (c) all fees and commissions lawfully due to brokers,
salesmen, and agents in connection with the Loan or the Property, (d) the cost
of the plats and surveys, (e) all premiums for the Insurance Policies, and
(f) all other costs and expenses payable to third parties incurred by Borrower
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Loan Agreement. Any costs and expenses to be paid by Borrower to Lender shall
be due as a condition precedent to any Advance, or at Lender's election, within
ten (10) days of Borrower's receipt of written notification of such costs and
expenses from Lender.

3.12    ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS. Borrower shall execute and deliver to
Lender, from time to time as requested by Lender, such other documents as shall
reasonably be necessary to provide the rights and remedies to Lender granted or
provided for by the Loan Documents.

3.13    NO LIABILITY OF LENDER.   Lender shall have no liability,
obligation, or responsibility whatsoever with respect to the construction of
the Buildings except to advance the Loan and the Borrower's Deposit pursuant to
this Loan Agreement. Lender shall not be obligated to inspect the Property or
the construction of the Buildings, nor be liable or responsible for any defect
in the Property or the Buildings by reason of Inspecting same, nor be liable
for the performance or default of Borrower, the Inspecting
Architects/Engineers, Contractor, or any other party, or for any failure to
construct, complete, protect, or insure the Buildings, or for the payment of
costs of labor, materials, or services supplied for the construction of the
Buildings, or for the performance of any obligation of Borrower whatsoever.
Nothing including without limitation any Advance or acceptance of any document
or instrument, shall be construed as a representation or warranty, express or
implied, to any party by Lender.

3.14    NO CONDITIONAL SALE CONTRACTS, ETC. No materials, equipment,
or fixtures shall be supplied, purchased, or installed for the construction of
the Buildings pursuant to security agreements, conditional sale contracts,

to any party to remove or repossess any materials, equipment, or fixtures
intended to be utilized in the construction or operation of the Buildings.

3.15    DEFENSE OF ACTIONS. Lender may (but shall not be obligated to)
commence, appear, in, or defend any action or proceeding purporting to affect
the Loan, the Property, or the respective rights and obligations of Lender and
Borrower pursuant to this Loan Agreement. Lender may (but shall not be
obligated to) pay all reasonable necessary expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with such proceedings or
action, which Borrower agrees to repay to Lender on demand; provided, however,
in any action directly between Borrower and Lender, the provisions of Section
5.14 shall apply.





<PAGE>   23
3.16    PROHIBITION ON TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OR ASSIGNMENT OF
BORROWER'S INTEREST, CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT.  Borrower, without the prior written
consent of Lender, shall not (a) transfer, lease or mortgage (i) all or any

paid when due all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Property
and the construction of the Buildings, and Borrower shall keep the Property
free and clear of any lien, tax, judgment, charge, or claim (the "CHARGES")
other than the encumbrances of the Mortgage, the Permitted Exceptions, and
other liens approved in writing by Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Loan Agreement, Borrower may (a) discharge in
accordance with applicable law any such Charge or contest the validity or
amount of any claim of any contractor, consultant, architect, or other Person
providing labor, materials, or services with respect to the Property, (b)
contest any tax or special assessments levied by any Governmental Authority,

a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto ("Excess
Interest"), then ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to
the highest lawful rate of interest permissible under such law and if, for any
reason whatsoever, Holder shall receive, as interest, an amount which would be
deemed unlawful under such applicable law, such interest shall be applied to
the principal of the Loan (whether or not due and payable), and not to the

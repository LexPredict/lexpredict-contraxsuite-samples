payable to the Contractor (a) related to the first five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000) of such direct increases in the Cost of the Work and (b) with respect
to any increase in the Cost of Work arising from the actual cost of any
allowance item exceeding the allowance cost of such item as reflected in the GMP
Breakdown (as defined in Subparagraph 5.2.1.1).

5.2      GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE (IF APPLICABLE)

5.2.1    The sum of the Cost of the Work and the  Contractor's Fee is
guaranteed by the Contractor not to exceed eighteen million two hundred
fifty-eight thousand dollars ($18,258,000),, subject to additions and deductions
by Change Order as provided in the Contract Documents. Such maximum sum is
referred to in the Contract Documents as the Guaranteed Maximum Price. Costs
which would cause the Guaranteed Maximum Price to be exceeded shall be paid by
the Contractor without reimbursement by the Owner.

5.2.1.1  A detailed, line-item breakdown of the Guaranteed Maximum Price,
including the Cost of the Work and the Contractor's Fee (the "GMP Breakdown"),
is attached hereto and incorporated herein as Schedule B.

5.2.1.2  The Owner shall be entitled to the "Guaranteed Maximum Price Savings"
(as such term is defined below). As of the date of final completion of the Work
the amount, if any, by which (x) exceeds (y) shall be considered the "Guaranteed
Maximum Price Savings," where (x) is the Guaranteed Maximum Price (as adjusted
from time to time through Change Orders) and (y) is the sum of the actual Cost
of the Work and the Contractor's Fee.

5.2.1.3  The Guaranteed Maximum Price is subject to the Qualifications and
Assumptions attached hereto and made a part hereof as Schedule C.

5.2.1.4  The Drawings and Specifications upon which the Guaranteed Maximum Price
is based are as listed and described in Schedule D attached hereto and made a
part hereof.
(INSERT SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IF THE CONTRACTOR IS TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY SAVINGS.)

5.2.2    By executing this Agreement, the Contractor represents that the
Drawings and Specifications listed in Schedule D describe the scope,
construction requirements and design intent of the Work in sufficient detail to
enable the Contractor to establish firmly the Guaranteed Maximum Price, subject
to the Qualifications and Assumptions. The Contractor shall not be permitted to
claim any adjustment in the Guaranteed Maximum Price in connection with Drawings
and Specifications issued subsequent to the date of this Agreement, except in
connection with Scope Changes as described in subparagraphs 5.2.2.1 though
5.2.2.3.

5.2.2.1  Subsequent to execution of this Agreement, the Architect will issue
additional Drawings and Specifications for portions of the Work and will issue
supplemental instructions, sketches and other materials intended to clarify the
Drawings and Specifications and/or provide details regarding the construction or
design of various parts of the Work (collectively, the "Supplemental Drawings
and Specifications"). The Contractor shall review all Supplemental

Drawings and Specifications in detail and shall, within fifteen (15) days of
receiving any Supplemental Drawings and Specifications, notify the Owner and
the Architect of any error, inconsistency or discrepancy that the Contractor
discovers between the Supplemental Drawings and Specifications and the Drawings
and Specifications listed in Schedule D to this Agreement. Within such fifteen
(15) day period the Contractor shall also notify the Owner in writing of any
item which, in the Contractor's opinion, represents a Scope Change, as defined
in subparagraph 5.2.2.2 below, setting forth, with particularity, the reasons
the Contractor contents such item represents a Scope Change (such notice shall
constitute a "Scope Change Request"). A Scope Change Request shall set forth the
Contractor's preliminary estimates of the increased costs and the impacts on the
Construction Schedule, if any, that the Contractor attributes to the Work
covered by such Scope Change Request. Failure of the Contractor to notify the
Owner of any item the Contractor considers a Scope Change within fifteen (15)
days after the date of receipt by the Contractor of Supplemental Drawings and
Specifications is hereby deemed to mean: (1) such Supplemental Drawings and
Specifications is hereby deemed to mean: (1) such Supplemental Drawings and
Specifications are consistent with the Drawings and Specifications listed in
Schedule D to this Agreement; (2) no Scope Changes exist; and (3) the Contractor
was willing and able to perform all of the Work for the Guaranteed Maximum Price
and in accordance with all the requirements of the Contract Documents. The
Contractor shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of any Supplemental
Drawings and Specifications that contain an item or items the Contractor
considers to require a Scope Change, prepare and provide to the Owner a detailed
breakdown of the proposed increase in the Guaranteed Maximum Price and the
proposed changes to the Construction Schedule and Milestone Dates, if any
related to such Scope Change.

5.2.2.2  A "Scope Change" is hereby deemed to mean Work described in the
Supplemental Drawings and Specifications which is not reasonably inferable from
the Drawings and Specifications listed in Schedule D to this Agreement and is
either (i) materially inconsistent with the Qualifications and Assumptions or
(ii) constitutes a change in the quantity, quality, programmatic requirements or
other substantial deviation from the Drawings and Specifications listed in
Schedule D to this Agreement.

5.2.2.3  If the Contractor timely submits a Scope Change Request to the Owner in
accordance with the requirements of subparagraph 5.2.2.1, the Owner shall have
one or more of the following options:

(1)     within ten (10) days of receipt of the Scope Change Request, the Owner
shall direct the Architect in writing, with a copy of such directive to the
Contractor, to modify that aspect of the Supplemental Drawings and
Specifications to which the Contractor objects. The Contractor shall cooperate
with the Owner and the Architect during the modification effort and shall make
recommendations appropriate to correct such portions of the Supplemental
Drawings and Specifications. The Architect shall submit to the Contractor the
revised Supplemental Drawings and Specifications as approved by the Owner. The
Contractor shall promptly re-examine such revised Supplemental Drawings and
Specifications as described in subparagraph 5.2.2.1;

(2)      if, upon review of the Scope Change Request, the Owner (after
consultation with the Architect) believes that the portion of the Work described
therein does not constitute a Scope Change, the Owner shall so advise the
Contractor within ten (10) days of receipt of the Scope Change Request. If such
disagreement is not resolved, the Work subject to disagreement shall be
identified in a schedule (the "Disputed Work Schedule"). The Owner and the
Contractor shall endeavor in good faith to resolve items set forth in the
Disputed Work Schedule expeditiously, confirming such resolution in Change
Orders. Items in the Disputed Work Schedule that are not resolved by the Owner
and the Contractor shall be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in Article 4 of the General Conditions. During the pendency of such
dispute resolution procedures, all items remaining in the Disputed Work Schedule
shall be performed by the Contractor as required by the Contract Documents and a
tentative adjustment shall be made to the Guaranteed Maximum Price in the amount
of the undisputed portion of the Scope Change Request. No adjustment shall be
made to the Guaranteed Maximum Price for disputed portions of the Scope Change
Request. For each remaining item in the Disputed Work Schedule, the Contractor
shall keep a specific, detailed accounting of the time and materials required to
complete such item. Adjustments to the Construction Schedule shall not be
permitted on a tentative basis;

(3)      if, upon review of the Scope Change Request, the Owner agrees that all
or a portion of the Work therein constitutes a Scope Change, and the Owner
elects not to direct the Architect to modify the Supplemental Drawings and
Specifications, the Owner and the Contractor shall enter into a written
agreement providing for changes to the Guaranteed Maximum Price and Construction
Schedule;

(4)      if, with respect to any item in the Scope Change Request, the Owner
does not, within the appropriate time limitations, (a) direct the Architect to
modify the Supplemental Drawings and Specifications, (b) advise the Contractor
in writing of disapproval of such item in the Scope Change Request, or (c) agree
that such item represents a Scope Change, then the Scope Change request with
respect to such item shall be deemed approved by the Owner and the Guaranteed
Maximum Price and the Construction Schedule shall be modified as requested by
the Contractor.

(STATE THE NUMBERS OR OTHER IDENTIFICATION OF ACCEPTED ALTERNATES, BUT ONLY IF A
GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE IS INSERTED IN SUBPARAGRAPH 5.2.1. IF DECISIONS ON
OTHER ALTERNATES ARE TO BE MADE BY THE OWNER SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXECUTION OF THIS
AGREEMENT, ATTACH A SCHEDULE OF SUCH OTHER ALTERNATES SHOWING THE AMOUNT FOR
EACH AND THE DATE UNTIL WHICH THAT AMOUNT IS VALID.)


5.2.3    The amounts agreed to for allowances are as set forth in Schedule E
attached hereto and made a part hereof.

7.3      GENERAL CONDITIONS

7.3.1    The term "General Conditions" shall mean, collectively, those properly
reimbursable Cost of the Work items that are specified in Schedule F attached
hereto. The General Conditions costs shall be the lump sum amount of six hundred
thousand dollars ($600,000); provided, however, that in the event that changed
in the Work cause the actual, proven jobsite costs for the General Conditions

be entitled to receive such excess General Conditions cost to the extent
attributable to changes in the Work, provided further, however, that there shall
be no increase in the amount that the Contractor is entitled to receive for such
excess General Conditions costs to the extent attributable to the first five
hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) of direct increases in the Cost of the Work

to the contrary in any of the Contract Documents, the General Conditions costs
shall be paid to the Contractor in monthly installments which, for any month,
shall be calculated by dividing the remaining General Conditions amounts by the
number of months from that month to the schedule date for Substantial Completion
of all the Work.

7.4      GMP BREAKDOWN

7.4.1    The GMP Breakdown includes a "Contingency" line item in the amount
noted thereon. Following the execution of this Agreement, the Contractor, with
the participation of the Owner and the Architect, shall select Subcontractors
and suppliers who shall provide labor, equipment and materials related to
completion of the Work. As this "buyout" process is completed, the GMP Breakdown
shall be revised and the actual costs associated with the line items in the GMP
Breakdown attached hereto shall be incorporated into such GMP Breakdown. Any net
savings between the estimated costs as reflected in the original GMP Breakdown
and the actual Subcontractor and supplier award amounts resulting from the
buyout process shall be allocated to the "Contingency" line item. The
Contingency shall be an amount available to reimburse the Contractor for
unanticipated costs for any of the Cost of the Work items provided for in
Article 7 (including the cost incurred by the Contractor in repairing or
correcting defective or nonconforming Work to the extent otherwise permitted
under Articles 7 and 8 hereof, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 7.4.2).
The Contractor shall notify the Owner monthly in writing with its Applications
for Payment of costs that the Contractor proposes be charged to the Contingency,
together with an explanation of the reason such cost is to be incurred.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no more than $140,000 shall be charged
to the Contingency for General Conditions items without the prior written
consent of the Owner.

7.4.2    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Contractor shall not
apply any portion of the Contingency for costs incurred in repairing or
correcting defective or nonconforming Work subsequent to final payment.

7.5      COSTS

7.5.1    Costs as defined herein shall be actual costs paid by the Contractor,
less all discounts, rebates and salvages which shall be taken by the Contractor,
subject to Article 9 of the Agreement.

7.5.2    Notwithstanding the breakdown or categorization of any costs to be
reimbursed in this Article 7 or elsewhere in the Contract Documents, there shall
be no duplication of payment in the event any particular items for which payment
is requested can be characterized as falling into more than one of the types of
compensable or reimbursable categories.

ARTICLE 10
SUBCONTRACTS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS

10.1     Those portions of the Work that the Contract or does not customarily
perform with the Contractor's own personnel shall be performed under
subcontracts or by other appropriate agreements with the Contractor. The
Contractor shall obtain bids from Subcontractors and from suppliers of materials
or equipment fabricated especially for the Work and shall deliver such bids to
the Architect. The Owner will then determine, with the advice of the Contractor
and subject to the reasonable objection of the Architect, which bids will be
accepted. The Owner may designate specific persons or entities from whom the
Contractor shall obtain bids; however, if a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been
established, the Owner may not prohibit the Contractor from obtaining bids from
others. The Contractor shall not be required to contract with anyone to whom the
Contractor has reasonable objection.

10.2     If a Guaranteed Maximum Price has been established and a specific
bidder among those whose bids are delivered by the Contractor to the Architect
(1) is recommended to the Owner by the Contractor; (2) is qualified to perform
that portion of the Work; and (3) has submitted a bid which conforms to the
requirements of the Contract Documents without unreasonable reservations or
exceptions, but the Owner requires that another bid be accepted; then the
Contractor may require that a Change Order be issued to adjust the Guaranteed
Maximum Price by the difference between the bid of the person or entity
recommended to the Owner by the Contractor and the amount of the subcontract or
other agreement actually signed with the person or entity designated by the
Owner.

10.3     Subcontracts or other agreements shall conform to the payment
provisions of Paragraphs 12.7 and 12.8, and shall not be awarded on the basis of
cost plus a fee without the prior consent of the Owner.

10.4     The Contractor shall not perform any trade Work with the Contractor's
own forces, or through an Affiliate (as hereinafter defined), except for the
trade Work specifically listed on Schedule G attached hereto and made a part
hereof (the "Permitted Contractor Trade Work"). In no event shall the Cost of
the Work attributable to any item of Permitted Contractor Trade Work exceed the
amount therefor specified on Schedule G. Such agreement shall, without
limitation, satisfy all requirements for Subcontracts as set forth in Paragraph
5.3.1 of the General Conditions. The term "Affiliate" is hereby deemed to mean
any party or entity related to or affiliated with the Contractor or in which the
Contractor has direct or indirect ownership or control, including, without
limitation: (i) any entity owned in whole or in part by the Contractor; (ii) any
party or entity with more than five percent (5.0%) interest in the Contractor;
and (iii) any entity in which any officer, director, employee, partner or
shareholder (or member of the family of any of the foregoing persons) of the
Contractor or any entity owned by the Contractor has a direct or indirect
interest.

overcharges (of any nature) by the Contractor, then, at the Owner's option,
either the Contractor shall immediately reimburse the Owner for such overcharge
or the Owner may deduct the amount of such overcharges from amounts otherwise
owed by the Owner to the Contractor.

ARTICLE 12
PROGRESS PAYMENTS

12.1     Based upon Applications for Payment, including all supporting
documentation submitted to the Architect by the Contractor and Certificates for
Payment issued by the Architect, the Owner shall make progress payments on
account of the Contract Sum to the Contractor as provided below and elsewhere in
the Contract Documents. The Contractor's Applications for Payment shall be
submitted on AIA Document G702 together with AIA Document G703.

12.2     The period covered by each Application for Payment shall be one
calendar month ending on the last day of the month, or as follows:

12.3     Provided an Application for Payment together with all required
supporting documentation properly prepared and submitted is received by the
Architect not later than the first day of a month, the Owner shall make payment
to the Contractor not later than the second to last day of such month. If an
Application for Payment is received by the Architect after the application date
fixed above, payment shall be made by the Owner not later than forty-five (45)
days after the Architect receives the Application for Payment.

12.4     With each Application for Payment the Contractor shall submit payrolls,
petty cash accounts, receipted invoices or invoices with check vouchers
attached, and any other evidence required by the Owner or Architect to
demonstrate that cash disbursements already made by the Contractor on account of
the Cost of the Work equal or exceed (1) progress payments already received by
the Contractor; less (2) that portion of those payments attributable to the
Contractor's Fee; plus (3) payrolls for the period covered by the present
Application for Payment; plus (4) retainage provided in Subparagraph 12.5.4, if
any, applicable to prior progress payments. In addition to other required items,
each Application for Payment shall be accompanied by the following all in form
and substance satisfactory to the Owner.

(5)      A revised Construction Schedule, updated to reflect actual conditions
in accordance with subparagraph 3.10.4 of the General Conditions; and

(6)      Such other information, documentation and materials as the Owner or the
Architect may require.

12.5     CONTRACTS WITH A GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE

12.5.1   Each Application for Payment shall be based upon the most recent
schedule of values submitted by the Contractor in accordance with the Contract
Documents. The schedule of values shall allocate the entire Guaranteed Maximum
Price among the various portions of the Work, except that the Contractor's Fee
shall be shown as a single separate item. The schedule of values shall be
prepared in such form and supported by such data to substantiate its accuracy as
the Architect may required. This schedule, unless objected to by the Architect,
shall be used as a basis for reviewing the Contractor's Applications for
Payment.

12.5.2   Applications for Payment shall show the percentage completion of each
portion of the Work as of the end of the period covered by the Application for
Payment. The percentage completion shall be the lesser of (1) the percentage of
that portion of the Work which has actually been completed or (2) the percentage
obtained by dividing (a) the expense which has actually been incurred by the
Contractor on account of that portion of the Work for which the Contractor has
made or intends to make actual payment prior to the next Application for Payment
by (b) the share of the Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion of
the Work in the schedule of values.

12.5.3   Subject to other provisions of the Contract Documents, the amount of
each progress payment shall be computed as follows:

12.5.3.1 Take that portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable to
completed Work as determined by multiplying the percentage completion of each
portion of the Work by the share of the Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to
that portion of the Work in the schedule of values. Pending final determination
of cost to the Owner of changes in the Work, amounts not in dispute may be
included as provided in Subparagraph 7.3.7 of the General Conditions, even
though the Guaranteed Maximum Price has not yet been adjusted by Change Order.
Except with respect to General Conditions items, amounts payable in accordance
with this Subparagraph 12.5.3.1 shall be reduced by retainage in the amount of
ten percent (10.0%). Retainage shall not be withheld from amounts payable to the
Construction manager for General Conditions items. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at the Owner's discretion and subject to the approval of the Owner's
construction lender, no additional retainage will be withheld from amounts
payable under this subparagraph after such time as the total Cost of the Work
completed, as reflected in Applications for Payment certified by the Architect,
equals fifty percent (50%) of the Guaranteed Maximum Price.

12.5.3.2 Add that portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable to
materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored at the site for subsequent
incorporation in the Work or, if approved in advance by the Owner and permitted
by the Owner's construction lender, suitably stored off the site at a location
agreed upon in writing. Amounts payable in accordance with this Subparagraph
12.5.3.2 shall be reduced by retainage of ten percent (10.0%). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at the Owner's discretion and subject to the approval of the
Owner's construction lender, no additional retainage will be withheld from
amounts payable under this subparagraph after such time as the total Cost of the
Work completed, as reflected in Applications for Payment certified by the
Architect, equals fifty percent (50%) of the Guaranteed Maximum Price.

12.5.3.3 Add the Contractor's Fee, less retainage of ten percent (10.0%). The
Contractor's Fee shall be computed upon the Cost of Work described in the two
preceding Clauses at the rate stated in Paragraph 5.1 or, if the Contractor's
Fee is stated as a fixed sum in that Paragraph, shall be an amount which bears
the same ratio to that fixed-sum Fee as the Cost of the Work in the two
preceding Clauses bears to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of the
Work upon its completion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Owner's
discretion and subject to the approval of the Owner's construction lender, no
additional retainage will be withheld from amounts payable under this
subparagraph after such time as the total Cost of the Work completed, as
reflected in Applications for Payment certified by the Architect, equals fifty
percent (50%) of the Guaranteed Maximum Price.

12.5.3.4 Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.

12.5.3.5 Subtract the shortfall, if any, indicated by the Contractor in the
documentation required by Paragraph 12.4 to substantiate prior Applications for
Payment, or resulting from errors subsequently discovered by the Owner's
accountants in such documentation.

12.5.3.6 Subtract amounts, if any, for which the Architect has withheld or
nullified a Certificate for Payment as provided in Paragraph 9.5 of the General
Conditions.

12.5.4   Additional retainage, if any, shall be as follows:
(If it is intended to retain additional amounts from progress payments to the
Contractor beyond (1) the retainage from the Contractor's Fee provided in Clause
12.5.3.3, (2) the retainage from Subcontractors provided in Paragraph 12.7
below, and (3) the retainage, if any, provided by other provisions of the
Contract, insert provision for such additional retainage here. Such provision,
if made, should also describe any arrangement for limiting or reducing the
amount retained after the Work reaches a certain state of completion.)

12.6     CONTRACTS WITHOUT A GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE

12.7     Except with the Owner's prior approval, payments to Subcontractors
included in the Contractor's Applications for Payment shall not exceed an amount
for each Subcontractor calculated as follows:

12.7.1   Take that portion of the Subcontract Sum properly allocable to
completed Work as determined by multiplying the percentage completion of each
portion of the Subcontractor's Work by the share of the total Subcontract Sum
allocated to that portion in the Subcontractor's

schedule of values, less retainage of ten percent (10.0%). Pending final
determination of amounts to be paid to the Subcontractor for changes in the
Work, amounts not in dispute may be included as provided in Subparagraph 7.3.7
of the General Conditions even though the Subcontract Sum has not yet been
adjusted by Change Order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner's discretion
and subject to the approval of the Owner's construction lender in each instance,
after such time as the total Cost of the Work completed, as reflected in
Applications for Payment certified by the Architect, equals fifty percent (50%)
of the Guaranteed Maximum Price: (1) no additional retainage shall be withheld
from amounts payable to a Subcontractor after such time as the Cost of the Work
allocable to Subcontractor's Work completed, as reflected in Applications for
Payment certified by the Architect, equals fifty percent (50%) of the
Subcontract Sum; and (2) the entire retainage allocable to such Subcontractor's
Work shall be released when such Subcontractor fully performs such
Subcontractor's Work.

12.7.2   Add that portion of the Subcontract Sum properly allocable to materials
and equipment delivered and suitably stored at the site for subsequent
incorporation in the Work or, if approved in advance by the Owner, suitable
stored off the site at a location agreed upon in writing, less retainage of ten
percent (10%).

12.7.3   Subcontract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Contractor
to the Subcontractor.

12.7.4   Subtract amounts, if any, for which the Architect has withheld or
nullified a Certificate for Payment by the Owner to the Contractor for reasons
which are the fault of the Subcontractor.

12.8     Except with the Owner's prior approval, the Contractor shall not make
advance payments to suppliers for materials or equipment which have not be
delivered and stored at the site.

12.9     In taking action on the Contractor's Applications for Payment, the
Architect shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of the
information furnished by the Contractor and shall not be deemed to represent
that the Architect has made a detailed examination, audit or arithmetic
verification of the documentation submitted in accordance with Paragraph 12.4 or
other supporting data; that the Architect has made exhaustive or continuous
on-site inspections or that the Architect has made examinations to ascertain how
or for what purposes the Contractor has used amounts previously paid on account
of the Contract. Such examinations, audits and verifications, if required by the
Owner, will be performed by the Owner's accountants acting in the sole interest
of the Owner.

12.10    Upon achievement of Substantial Completion of the Work, the Owner shall
release all retainage to the Contractor except an amount equal to two hundred
percent (200%) of the value of incomplete or defective Work as identified in the
Punchlist.

ARTICLE 13
FINAL PAYMENT

13.1     Final payment shall be made by the Owner to the Contractor when (1)
the Contract has been fully performed by the Contractor except for the
Contractor's responsibility to correct defective or nonconforming Work, as
provided in Subparagraph 12.2.2 of the General Conditions, and to satisfy other
requirements, if any, which necessarily survive final payment; (2) a final
Application for Payment and a final accounting for the Cost of the Work and all
supporting documentation have been submitted by the Contractor and reviewed by
the Owner's accountants; and (3) a final Certificate for Payment has then been
issued by the Architect; such final payment shall be made by the Owner not more
than 30 days after the issuance of the Architect's final Certificate for
Payment, or as follows:

13.2     The amount of the final payment shall be calculated as follows:

13.2.1   Take the sum of the Cost of the Work substantiated by the Contractor's
final accounting and the Contractor's Fee; but not more than the Guaranteed
Maximum Price, if any.

13.2.2   Subtract amounts, if any, for which the Architect withholds, in whole
or in part, a final Certificate for Payment as provided in Subparagraph 9.5.1 of
the General Conditions or other provisions of the Contract Documents.

13.2.3   Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.

If the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner exceeds the amount due
the Contractor, the Contractor shall reimburse the difference to the Owner.

13.3     The Owner's accountants will review and report in writing on the
Contractor's final accounting within 30 days after delivery of the final
accounting to the Architect by the Contractor. Based upon such Cost of the Work
as the Owner's accountants report to be substantiated by the Contractor's final
accounting, and provided the other conditions of Paragraph 13.1 have been met,
the Architect will, within seven days after receipt of the written report of the
Owner's accountants, either issue to the Owner a final Certificate for Payment
with a copy to the Contractor, or notify the Contractor and Owner in writing of
the Architect's reasons for withholding a certificate as provided in
Subparagraph 9.5.1 of the General Conditions. The time periods stated in this
Paragraph 13.3 supersede those stated in Subparagraph 9.4.1 of the General
Conditions.

13.4     If the Owner's accountants report the Cost of the Work as
substantiated by the Contractor's final accounting to be less than claimed by
the Contractor, the Contractor shall be entitled to demand arbitration of the
disputed amount without a further decision of the Architect. Such demand for
arbitration shall be made by the Contractor within 30 days after the
Contractor's receipt of a copy of the Architect's final Certificate for Payment;
failure to demand arbitration within this 30-day period shall result in the
substantiated amount reported by the

Owner's accountants becoming binding on the Contractor. Pending a final
resolution by arbitration, the Owner shall pay the Contractor the amount
certified in the Architect's final Certificate for Payment.

13.5     If, subsequent to final payment and at the Owner's request, the
Contractor incurs costs described in Article 7 and not excluded by Article 8 to
correct defective or nonconforming Work, the Owner shall reimburse the
Contractor such costs and the Contractor's Fee applicable thereto on the same
basis as if such costs had been incurred prior to final payment, but not in
excess of the Guaranteed Maximum Price, if any. If the Contractor has
participated in savings as provided in Paragraph 5.2, the amount of such savings
shall be recalculated and appropriate credit given to the Owner in determining
the net amount to be paid by the Owner to the Contractor.

ARTICLE 15
TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION

15.1     The Contract may be terminated by the Contractor as provided in
Article 14 of the General Conditions, however, the amount to be paid to the
Contractor under Subparagraph 14.1.2 of the General Conditions shall not exceed
the amount the Contractor would be entitled to receive under Paragraph 15.3
below, except that unless such termination is based on the reasons set forth in
14.1.1.1 or 14.1.1.2, the Contractor's Fee shall be calculated as if the Work
had been fully completed by the Contractor, including a reasonable estimate of
the Cost of the Work for Work not actually completed.

15.2     If a Guaranteed Maximum Price is established in Article 5, the
Contract may be terminated by the Owner for cause as provided in Article 14 of
the General Conditions; however, the amount, if any, to be paid to the
Contractor under Subparagraph 14.2.4 of the General Conditions shall not cause
the Guaranteed Maximum Price to be exceeded, nor shall it exceed the amount the
Contractor would be entitled to receive under Paragraph 15.3 below.

15.3     If no Guaranteed Maximum Price is established in Article 5, the
Contract may be terminated by the Owner for cause as provided in Article 14 of
the General Conditions; however, the Owner shall then pay the Contractor an
amount calculated as follows:

15.3.1   Take the Cost of the Work incurred by the Contractor to the date of
termination.

15.3.2   Add the Contractor's Fee computed upon the Cost of the Work to the date
of termination at the rate stated in Paragraph 5.1 or, if the Contractor's Fee
is stated as a fixed sum in that Paragraph, an amount which bears the same ratio
to that fixed-sum Fee as the Cost of the Work at the time of termination bears
to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of the Work upon its completion.

15.3.3   Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner. The
Owner shall also pay the Contractor fair compensation, either by purchase or
rental at the election of the Owner, for any equipment owned by the Contractor
which the Owner elects to retain and which is not otherwise included in the Cost
of the Work under Subparagraph 15.3.1. To the extent that the Owner elects to
take legal assignment of subcontracts and purchase orders (including rental
agreements), the Contractor shall, as a condition of receiving the payments
referred to in this Article 15, execute and deliver all such papers and take
such steps, including the legal assignment of such subcontracts and other
contractual rights of the Contractor, as the Owner may require for the purpose
of fully vesting in the Owner the rights and benefits of the Contractor under
such subcontracts or purchase orders. Unless the termination is for cause, the
Contractor

orders requested by the Owner, to agree to pay all sums owed the
Subcontractor(s) or supplier(s) whose agreements are being assigned for (i) Work
previously performed to the extent that such sums are due and owing and that the
Contractor has not already received progress payments designated for payment of
such Work and (ii) for services thereafter rendered and materials thereafter
furnished in accordance with the terms of such subcontracts or purchase orders.

15.4     The Work may be suspended by the Owner as provided in Article 14 of the
General Conditions; in such case, the Guaranteed Maximum Price, if any, shall be
increased as provided in Subparagraph 14.3.2 of the General Conditions except
that the term "cost of performance of the Contract" in that Subparagraph shall
be understood to mean the Cost of the Work and the term "profit" shall be
understood to mean the Contractor's Fee as described in Paragraphs 5.1 and 6.3

EXHIBIT 10.39




FOURTH AMENDMENT TO CONSTRUCTION LOAN AGREEMENT


This Fourth Amendment to Construction Loan Agreement is dated as of the 11th day of
December, 2007, and is by and between RED TRAIL ENERGY, LLC, a North Dakota limited liability
company (“BORROWER”), and FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF OMAHA (“BANK”), a national banking association
established at Omaha, Nebraska.



WHEREAS, the BANK and BORROWER executed a written Construction Loan Agreement dated as of
December 16, 2005 (“AGREEMENT”).



Now, Therefore, in consideration of the AGREEMENT, and their mutual promises made herein, BANK and
BORROWER agree as follows:




1. Terms which are typed herein as all capitalized words and are not defined herein shall have
same meanings as when described in the AGREEMENT.



2. On April 16, 2007, pursuant to Section 2.5 of the AGREEMENT, BORROWER executed and
delivered to BANK its VARIABLE RATE NOTE, in the principal amount of $17,605,870.00; its
LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE, in the principal amount of $10,000,000.00; and its FIXED RATE
NOTE, in the principal amount of $27,605,870.00. BORROWER has requested BANK to permit
the replacement of the VARIABLE RATE NOTE in order to reduce the amount of borrowed funds
subject to variable rates and to increase the portion of the OBLIGATIONS represented by
fixed rate financing. As the result, on execution of this amendment, BORROWER will deliver a
replacement of the VARIABLE RATE NOTE, with such replacement having the principal amount of
$6,777,887.23, and a new note (“2007 FIXED RATE NOTE”) having a principal amount of
$10,000,000.00.



3. Effective immediately, Section 1.24 of the AGREEMENT is amended to read:




1.24 “LOAN TERMINATION DATE” means the earliest to occur of the following: (i) as to the
REVOLVING NOTE, July 17, 2008, as to FIXED RATE NOTE, 2007 FIXED RATE NOTE, VARIABLE RATE
NOTE and as to LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE, April 16, 2012, (ii) the date the OBLIGATIONS are
accelerated pursuant to this AGREEMENT, and (iii) the date BANK has received (a) notice in
writing from BORROWER of BORROWER’s election to terminate this AGREEMENT and (b)
indefeasible payment in full of the OBLIGATIONS.



4. Effective immediately, Section 2.5 of the AGREEMENT is amended to read:




2.5 TERM LOAN. The existing balance on the CONSTRUCTION LOAN, including any advance
made to increase WORKING CAPITAL, as of COMPLETION DATE will be restated and said balance
will be paid by four promissory notes (“TERM NOTES”), hereafter called “FIXED RATE
NOTE”,“2007 FIXED RATE NOTE”, “VARIABLE RATE NOTE”, and “LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE”, in form

mutually acceptable to BANK and BORROWER. The TERM NOTES evidence “TERM LOANS”. Payments on
such TERM NOTES shall be as follows:



On the sixteenth day of every third month, commencing three months after COMPLETION DATE,
BORROWER shall pay to BANK the scheduled principal payment shown in Schedule I, attached
hereto and by this reference made a part hereof, plus accrued interest on FIXED RATE NOTE,
together with the scheduled principal payment shown in Schedule II, attached hereto and to
the 2007 FIXED RATE NOTE, by this reference made a part hereof, plus accrued interest on
2007 FIXED RATE NOTE.



In addition, on the sixteenth day of every third month, commencing three months after
COMPLETION DATE, BORROWER shall pay $634,729.57 to BANK, which shall be allocated as
follows:



a. first to accrued interest on LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE;



b. next to accrued interest on VARIABLE RATE NOTE;



c. next to principal on VARIABLE RATE NOTE;




After VARIABLE RATE NOTE has been fully paid, such quarterly payments shall be
allocated first to accrued interest on LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE, and thence to
principal, reducing available revolving loan capacity. All unpaid
principal and accrued interest under the TERM LOANS shall be due and
payable on LOAN
TERMINATION DATE, if not sooner paid.


5. BORROWER
certifies by its execution hereof that the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 5 of the AGREEMENT are true as of this date, and that no EVENT OF
DEFAULT under the AGREEMENT, and no event which, with the giving of notice or passage of
time or both, would become such an EVENT OF DEFAULT, has occurred as of this date.


6. Except
as amended hereby the parties ratify and confirm as binding upon them all of
the terms of the AGREEMENT.


IN WITNESS whereof the parties set their hands as of the date first written above.

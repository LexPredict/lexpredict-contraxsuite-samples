Contract or any Subcontract. Borrower agrees to cooperate with Lender
in any such action. If in the course of any such verification, any
amount shown on the contract entered into for the performance of any
portion of the Work (including the Construction Contract or any
Subcontract), or any application for payment, sworn statement or waiver
of lien is subject to a possible discrepancy, such discrepancy shall be
eliminated by Borrower to Lender's reasonable satisfaction. Each

the Work, (B) that there has been no material deviation from the
contract amount under the Construction Contract or any
Subcontract or the projected time of completion of any component
of the Work, (C) the total cost to complete the Work, (D) and

payment, plus the amount then requested, the remaining
uncertified and undisbursed funds will be sufficient to pay all
known costs required to complete the Work in accordance with the
Plans and Specifications;

(v)  Copies of all licenses and permits (including
building permits) necessary for construction and completion of
the Work with respect thereto; and

(vi) Such other documents, assignments, certificates and
opinions as are required by the Title Company, or as may be

(c)     Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, Lender shall not be required to make any disbursement of
the Loan pursuant to this Agreement until the Title Company is
prepared to issue an endorsement to the Title Policy updating the same
to the date of such disbursement and increasing the amount of coverage
(including mechanic's lien coverage) thereunder by the amount so
disbursed, and insuring the lien of the Deed of Trust to be superior

representations and warranties contained in Article 5 below are true and correct
in all material respects as of the date of such request, (b) Borrower's
certification that Borrower is in compliance with the conditions contained in
this Article 4, and (c) Borrower's representation and warranty to Lender, with
respect to the Work, materials and other items for which payment is requested
that (i) such Work and materials have been incorporated into the Project, free
and clear of liens and encumbrances, (ii) the value thereof is as estimated
therein, (iii) such Work and materials substantially conform  to the Plans and
Specifications, this Agreement and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, and (iv) the requisitioned value of such Work and
materials and the amounts of all other items of cost for which payment is
requested by Borrower have theretofore been in fact paid for in cash by Borrower
or the same are then due and owing by Borrower and (unless Lender disburses
funds directly to the parties performing the Work or to the Title Company) will
in fact be paid in cash by Borrower within five days after Borrower's receipt of
the requested disbursement. Neither review nor approval by Lender or requests
for disbursement or any information contained therein or any other information
provided to Lender in accordance with the other provisions of this Article 4
shall constitute the acceptance or approval by Lender of any portion of the Work
or any such information except for the purpose of making the requested
disbursement.


14

<PAGE>
4.5 Costs. For purposes of this Agreement, including without
limitation, Section 4.3 hereof, (a) the cost of labor and material furnished for
the Work shall be deemed to be incurred by Borrower when the labor and material
have been incorporated into the Project and the payment therefor is due and
payable, (b) the cost of services (other than labor included in the Work) shall
be deemed to be incurred by Borrower when the services are actually rendered and
the payment therefor is due and payable, (c) real estate taxes, interest and
insurance premiums shall be deemed to be incurred by Borrower when such items
become due and payable, and (d) any other costs shall be deemed to be incurred
by Borrower when the payment therefor is due and payable, but not before the
value to be received in return for such cost has been received by Borrower.

4.6 Development Fees. No proceeds of the Loan will be disbursed for
development fees but project management direct costs and reimbursable expenses
will be paid to HADC as set forth in the Budget.

4.7 Loan In Balance.

(a) At all times prior to the Maturity Date, (i) the
undisbursed proceeds from the Loan together with the undisbursed amount
of the Borrower's Equity and the Subordinate Loan, shall be sufficient
to pay all Project Costs remaining unpaid through the projected date on
which the Improvements will be substantially completed.

(b) If Lender reasonable determines that the undisbursed
proceeds from the Loan together with the undisbursed amount of the
Borrower's Equity and the Subordinate Loan, are insufficient to pay all
Project Costs remaining unpaid through the projected date on which the
Improvements will be substantially completed, then the Loan shall be
deemed "out of balance" to the extent of such excess.

(c) If Lender reasonably deems the Loan to be out of balance
as aforesaid, Borrower shall, within ten days after written request by
Lender, deposit with Lender an amount equal to the excess amount. The
sums thus deposited with Lender will be disbursed by Lender to complete
the Work prior to any further disbursement of proceeds of the Loan (or,
if the Work has been completed, to the repayment of the Principal
Balance). If such deposit is not made within such time, an Event of
Default shall be deemed to have occurred. No interest shall be payable
to Lender on such amounts when disbursed to pay the cost of any Work.

(d) Borrower shall be entitled to reallocate among line items
in the Budget without obtaining Lender's prior written consent, so long
as such reallocation does not result in an increase in the Project
Budget. The amount allocated to the contingency and the interest
reserves line shall, at all times, be an amount reasonably acceptable
to the Lender.

4.8 Application of Disbursements.


15
<PAGE>

(a)  Lender shall make each requested disbursement of the Loan to
an account maintained by Borrower with Lender within ten days after
all of the conditions precedent to such disbursement set forth in
Section 4.1 above have been satisfied and all documentation required
under Section 4.3 above has been delivered to Lender.

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender shall not be
responsible, liable or obligated to the contractors, sub-contractors,
suppliers, materialmen, laborers, architects, engineers, or any other
parties, for services or work performed, or for goods delivered by
them or any of them, in and upon the Land or employed directly or
indirectly in the performance of the Work, or for any debts or claims
whatsoever accruing in favor of any such parties and against Borrower
or others, or against the Project. It is expressly understood and
agreed that Borrower is not and shall not be an agent of Lender for
any purpose whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, advances made at Lender's option, directly to any
contractor, subcontractor or supplier of labor or materials, or any
other party, shall not be deemed a recognition by Lender of any third
party beneficiary status of any such person or entity.

(c)  Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall receive all Loan
Advances to be made hereunder by Lender as a trust fund and that
Borrower shall withdraw and use said funds solely for the payment of
the bills for the labor and materials used in the performance of the
Work for which such Loan funds were requested by Borrower, and for the
payment of the other items of Project Cost for which such Loan
proceeds were requested by Borrower, and for no other purpose
whatsoever; however, nothing herein shall impose upon Lender any
obligation whatsoever to see to the proper application of any such
monies by Borrower.

(d)  Whenever so requested by Lender, Borrower shall promptly
furnish Lender written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that
all monies theretofore advanced by Lender pursuant to this Agreement
have actually been paid or applied in payment of the cost of
performance of the Work and in payment of the other items of Project
Cost for which such funds were advanced by Lender, and until such
evidence is produced, at the option of Lender, no future or additional
payments or Loan Advances need be made hereunder.

4.9  Payment of Interest by Lender. Proceeds of the Loan shall be
allocated to an interest reserve (the "Interest Reserve") as set forth in the
Budget approved by Lender. All accrued interest on the Loan shall be paid from
the Interest Reserve until fully disbursed and thereafter from rental income
received by Borrower under the Master Lease. Borrower hereby authorizes Lender
on the first day of each month during the term of the Loan (and on any other
date on which interest is due under the Note) to disburse to itself from the
undisbursed proceeds of the Interest Reserve to pay all then accrued and unpaid
interest on the Loan; provided, however, that such authorization shall not be
deemed to limit, reduce or otherwise affect Borrower's obligation to pay
interest if (a) there are no remaining amounts in the Interest



16

<PAGE>
Reserve, or (b) Lender is entitled to withhold disbursement of the Interest
Reserve for any reason.

Borrower for such purpose) is sufficient to pay the full and complete
costs of such restoration, (iv) neither the Lease nor the Ground Lease
will be terminated as a result of such casualty or condemnation, (v) if
the cost of restoration exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Loan
Amount, in Lender's sole determination after completion of restoration

reasonable determination, the Project can be restored to an
architecturally and economically viable project in compliance with
applicable Laws, and (vii) in Lender's reasonable determination, such
restoration is likely to be completed not later than three months prior

applicable.

6.2 Borrower's Obligation to Rebuild and Use of Proceeds Therefor. In
case Lender does not elect to apply or does not have the right to apply the
Proceeds to the indebtedness, as provided in Section 6.1 above, Borrower shall:

the appropriate governmental authorities and cause the Proceeds to be
deposited with Lender;

insurers or the appropriate governmental authorities or effecting
collection of the Proceeds, deposit with Lender the fully amount
required to complete construction as aforesaid;

21

(c)  In the event the Proceeds and the available proceeds of the Loan
are insufficient to assure the Lender that the Loan will be In Balance, promptly
deposit with Lender any amount necessary to place the Loan in Balance; and

(d)  Promptly proceed with the assumption of construction of the
Improvements, including the repair of all damage resulting from such fire,
condemnation or other cause and restoration to its former condition.

Any request by Borrower for a disbursement by Lender of Proceeds and
funds deposited by Borrower shall be treated by Lender as if such request were
for an advance of the Loan hereunder, and the disbursement thereof shall be
conditioned upon Borrower's compliance with and satisfaction of the same
conditions precedent as would be applicable under this Agreement for an advance
on the Loan.

7.       BORROWER'S COVENANTS.

7.1  Manner of Construction.  Borrower shall, at its expense, cause the
Work to be diligently and expeditiously carried out, in a good and workmanlike

or additional contract does not involve work of a structural nature or modify
the exterior of the Improvements and does not increase the total Project Cost in
excess of Thirty-Three Million One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($33,160,000),
and (iii) following the implementation of each such amendment, change order or
additional contract, the amount of the contingency reserve contained in the
Budget shall be an amount reasonably acceptable to the Lender. As a condition
precedent to Lender approving any amendment, change order or additional
contract, or to Borrower entering into any other contract for the performance of
any portion of the Work, Borrower shall, immediately upon request of Lender and
prior to commencing any Work relating to any such amendment, change order or


22




<PAGE>
additional contract, deposit with Lender an amount of money as reasonably
determined by the Lender after taking into account the additional costs and
expenses resulting from said amendment, change order, or additional contract.

7.4      Compliance with Laws. Borrower shall comply or cause
compliance with all applicable building codes, zoning ordinances, environmental
protection, health and safety laws and regulations and other laws and
regulations governing the construction, development, use and operation of the
Project and the development, operation and sale of the Improvements. Evidence
of such compliance shall be submitted to Lender on request.

7.5      Inspection. Borrower shall permit inspection of the Project by
Lender, the Consultant and any other agent or designee of Lender. in addition,
upon prior reasonable notice, Borrower shall permit Lender an/or its agents and
designees access to and the right to inspect, audit and copy all books, records,
contracts, leases and other documents and information relating to Borrower or
the Project. All such books, records and accounts of operations relating to the
Project shall be kept in accordance with sound accounting practices consistently
applied. Borrower shall promptly respond to any inquiry from Lender for
information with respect to the Project which information may be verified by
Lender at Borrower's expense; provided, however, that Lender shall at all times
be entitled to rely upon any statements or representations made by Borrower or
any agent thereof.

7.6      Mechanics' Liens. Borrower shall not permit any mechanics'
lien claims to be filed or otherwise asserted against the Project or against any
funds due any contractor or subcontractor, and Borrower shall promptly (and in
any event within fifteen days after Borrower has received notice of such filing)
discharge or cause to be discharged the same in case of the filing of any claims
for lien or proceedings for the enforcement thereof; provided that in connection
with any such lien or claim which Borrower may in good faith desire to contest,
Borrower may contest the same by appropriate legal proceedings diligently
prosecuted, but only if Borrower shall furnish to the Title Company such
security or indemnity as the Title company requires to induce the Title Company
to issue an endorsement to the Title Policy insuring over the exception created
by such lien, and provided further, that Lender shall not be required to make
any further disbursements of the Loan until any mechanics' lien claims have been
so insured against by the Title Company.

7.7      Release by Lender. With respect to the matters set forth in
Section 7.6 above, if Borrower shall (a) fail promptly to discharge any asserted
liens or claims, or (b) fail promptly to contest asserted liens or claims or to
give security or indemnity in the manner provided in Section 7.6 above, or (c)
having commenced to contest the same, and having given such security or
indemnity, fail to prosecute such contest with diligence, or to maintain such
indemnity or security so required by the Title company for its full amount, or
(d) upon adverse conclusion of any such contest, fail promptly to cause any
judgment or decree to be satisfied and lien to be released, then lender may, but
shall not be required to, upon prior written notice to Borrower procure the
release and discharge of any such claim and any judgment or decree thereon and,


23
<PAGE>

further, may, in its sole discretion, effect any settlement or compromise of
the same, or may furnish such security or indemnity to the Title Company, and
any amounts so expended by Lender, including premiums paid or security
furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds, shall be
deemed to constitute disbursements of the proceeds of the Loan hereunder and
shall bear interest from the date so disbursed until paid at the Default Rate.
In settling, compromising or discharging any claims for lien, Lender shall not
be required to inquire into the validity or amount of any such claim.

7.8      Financial Statements; Reports.  During the term of the Loan,
Borrower will furnish to Lender: (i) on or before April 30 of each year annual
operating statements and balance sheets for Borrower, Foundation Surgical
Associates, Inc., and financial statements of each Limited Guarantor; (ii)
within thirty (30) days after the same are filed, copies of the federal tax
returns for each Limited Guarantor, Borrower and the Trust together with copies
of all filings by the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and
(iii) from and after the commencement of occupancy of the Tenant within thirty
(30) days following the end of each calendar quarter operating statements of
the Borrower and Tenant. With respect to Foundation Surgical Associates, Inc.
and the individual Limited Guarantors, failure to furnish such financial
statements or tax returns shall not be an Event of Default hereunder so long as
Borrower makes a responsible effort to do so.

7.9      Affirmation of Representations and Warranties.  Borrower
agrees that all representations and warranties of Borrower contained in Article
5 hereof shall remain true in all material respects at all times until the Loan
is repaid in full.

7.10     Title.  Except for (a) the Deed of Trust and other security
for the Loan, and (b) the Permitted Exceptions, Borrower shall keep the title
to the Real Property and the Personal Property free of all liens, claims and
encumbrances, whether senior or junior to or at parity with the Deed of Trust
and such other security, subject, however, to Borrower's right to contest
mechanics' liens provided in Section 7.6 above.

7.11     Proceedings Affecting Property.  If any proceedings are filed
seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent or declare invalid or unlawful the
construction, occupancy, use, maintenance or operation of the Project, or any
portion thereof, Borrower shall cause such proceedings to be vigorously
contested in good faith, and in the event of an adverse ruling or decision,
prosecute all allowable appeals therefrom, and shall, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, resist the entry or seek the stay of any temporary
or permanent injunction that may be entered, and use its best efforts to bring
about a favorable and speedy disposition of all such proceedings. All such
proceedings, including without limitation, all of Lender's costs, and fees and
disbursements of Lender's counsel in connection with any such proceedings,
whether or not Lender is a party thereto, shall be at Borrower's expense. To
the extent that Lender incurs any such expenses, including attorneys' fees and
fees and charges for court costs, bonds and the like, Borrower shall reimburse
Lender for such expenses and the amount due Lender shall bear interest from the
date so incurred by Lender until repaid to Lender at the Default Rate and shall
be payable to Lender


24


<PAGE>
on demand. The foregoing provisions of this Section 7.11 shall not limit or
affect the provisions of Section 10(i) below.

7.12     Disposal and Encumbrance of Property.  Except for the Lease
and the Subordinate Loan, Borrower shall not, without Lender's prior written
consent, suffer, permit or enter into any agreement for any sale, lease,
transfer, or in any way encumber or dispose of or grant or suffer any security
or other assignment (collateral or otherwise) of or in all or any portion of
the Project. Any consent given by Lender or deemed to have been given by
Lender, or any waiver of default under this Section 7.12, shall not constitute
a consent to, or waiver of any right, remedy or power of Lender under any
subsequent default hereunder.

7.13     Insurance.  Borrower shall obtain and at all times maintain
the insurance required upon the terms of the Deed of Trust Borrower shall pay
all premiums on all insurance policies required from time to time under this
Agreement, and thirty days prior to expiration of any such policies, Borrower
shall furnish to Lender, with premiums prepaid, additional and renewal policies
in form, and with companies, coverage, deductibles and amounts satisfactory to
Lender. In the event of failure by Borrower to provide such insurance, Lender
may, but shall not be required to, place insurance and treat the amounts
expended therefor as disbursements of Loan proceeds and such amounts from the
date so expended by Lender until repaid to Lender shall bear interest at the
Default Rate. Borrower shall not store materials or supplies on the Project
site without first providing to Lender evidence of insurance covering such
materials or supplies, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender.

7.14     Performance of Obligations; Notice of Default.  Borrower
shall promptly and fully perform and comply in all respects with the
obligations, terms, agreements, provisions and requirements of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and all other documents and instruments relating
thereto and will not permit to occur any default or breach hereunder or
thereunder. Borrower shall promptly give to Lender notice of the occurrence of
any event which does or would with the passage of time or the giving of notice,
or both, constitute an Event of Default, or have any material adverse effect on
any security for the Loan or on Borrower's ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or on the Guarantors'
ability to perform his obligations under the Guaranty and the other Loan
Documents to which they are parties.

7.15     Subcontracts.  Within ten days after being executed, Borrower
shall deliver to Lender a copy of each Subcontract entered into by the
Contractor for an amount exceeding $500,000.

7.16     Restrictions Affecting Borrower.  Borrower covenants and
agrees that, without the prior written consent of Lender, there shall not
occur: (i) any amendment or modification of the Certificate of Limited
Partnership or Partnership Agreement establishing or governing Borrower, (ii)
the release or discharge of any partner of Borrower, or (iii) the admission of
any new partner.

25


<PAGE>

and receipts realized and received by Borrower from and in connection with the
Project during the term of the Loan to be used, first for the purpose of paying
interest on the Loan in accordance with Paragraph 4.9 above, and then for the
actual costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in connection with the ownership,
operation, management and repair of the Project, including without limitation,
operating expenses, real estate taxes and insurance premiums.

7.18  Compliance.  Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause Tenant
to comply in all respects with the terms of that certain advisory opinion issued
by the United States Department of Health and Human Services dated July 8, 2004.

pertaining to the title to the Land without the prior written approval of Lender
of the form and substance of such documents.

8.       LOAN EXPENSES.  Borrower agrees to pay all of the Loan Expenses. Any
Loan Expenses paid by Lender shall bear interest commencing on the date demand
for repayment thereof is made by Lender until paid at the Default Rate and
shall be paid by Borrower upon demand, or may be paid by Lender at any time by
disbursement of proceeds of the Loan. Any Loan Expenses paid by Lender shall be
reimbursed to Lender by Borrower regardless of whether there shall be any
disbursements of the Loan.

9.       LENDER'S REPRESENTATIVES.  Lender, at Borrower's expense as identified
in the Budget, shall have the right to engage third party personnel in
connection with negotiation, documentation and administration of the Loan,
including without limitation, the Consultant, to (i) review the Plans and
Specifications, (ii) review Borrower's final construction budget, (iii) conduct
monthly inspections of the Work and report on the progress of construction
thereof, (iv) review all change orders, (v) review applications for
disbursements and accompanying documents, (vi) issue reports and certificates
to Lender, (vii) inspect the structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, HVAC
and roof systems constituting the Work, (viii) determine whether the Work has
been completed in accordance with the Plans and Specifications, and (ix)
provide other services a requested by Lender, and Borrower shall fully
cooperate with the Consultant and other personnel in all reasonable respects in
connection therewith.

10.      EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  The occurrence of any one or more of the following
shall constitute an "Event of Default":

(a)  Failure by Borrower or any other obligor to pay any
installment of principal or interest or any other amount payable
pursuant to the Note, this Agreement, the Indemnity Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents on or before the fifth day after the date when
such amount is due and payable.

(b)  Failure by Borrower to promptly perform or cause to be

<PAGE>
agreement or provision required to be performed or observed by Borrower or
Guarantor under this Agreement, the Note, the Deed of Trust, the Indemnity
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; provided, however, ,that if such
failure by its nature can be cured, then so long as the continued operation and
safety of the Project, and the priority, validity and enforceability of the lien
created by the Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents and the value of
the Project are not imminently impaired, threatened or jeopardized, then
Borrower shall have a period (the "Cure Period") of thirty (30) days after
written notice from Lender of any such failure of performance or observance to
cure or cause the cure of the same, and an Event of Default shall not be deemed
to exist during the Cure Period, provided further that if Borrower commences to
cure such failure during the Cure Period and is diligently and in good faith
attempting to effect such cure, the Cure Period shall be extended for thirty
additional days, but in no event shall the Cure Period be longer than sixty days
in the aggregate. The foregoing Cure Period is intended only to apply in
circumstances not referred to in any of the other paragraphs of this Section 10;
Borrower's right to a grace or cure period, if any, with respect to such other
circumstances are to be governed by the provisions of such other paragraphs.

(c)      The existence of any material inaccuracy or untruth in any
representation, covenant or warranty contained in this Agreement or any other
Loan Documents, or of any statement or certification as to facts delivered to
Lender by or on behalf of Borrower, Guarantor or any other applicant for the
Loan.

(d)      A discontinuance of the construction of the Work for a period
of thirty consecutive business days (unless otherwise approved by Lender), other
than a discontinuance resulting from Force Majeure events (it being understood
that a delay caused by an insufficiency of funds shall not be deemed to be
beyond the control of Borrower), or any delay in the Work, other than Force
Majeure events, the result of which may be, in Lender's sole judgment, that the
Work will not be substantially completed on or before the Completion Date.

(e)      At any time Borrower or a Guarantor files a voluntary
petition in bankruptcy, or institutes (by petition, application, answer,
consent or otherwise) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,
composition, readjustment, dissolution, liquidation or similar proceedings
under any present or future federal, state or other statute or law, or admits
in writing his or its inability to pay his or its debts as they mature, or
makes an assignment for the benefit of his or its creditors, or seeks or
consents to the appointment of any receiver, trustee or similar officer for all
or any substantial part of his or its property.

(f)      The commencement of any involuntary petition in bankruptcy
against Borrower or Guarantor or the institution against Borrower or Guarantor
of any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, dissolution,
liquidation or similar proceedings under any present or future federal, state or
other statute or law, or


27
<PAGE>
the appointment of a receiver, trustee or other officer for all or any
substantial part of the property of Borrower or Guarantor which
remains undismissed or discharged for a period of sixty (60) days.

(g)  The disapproval by Lender at any time of any Work for
failure to comply with the Plans and Specifications or any other
provisions of this Agreement, and Borrower's failure to cause the
same to be corrected to the satisfaction of Lender within fifteen
business days after the date Borrower is given written notice of such

financing, lien, encumbrance or other transaction made in violation of
Section 7.12 or 7.16 above.

(i)  Failure of Borrower for a period of thirty days after
Lender's demand to procure the reversal, dismissal or disposition to
Lender's satisfaction of any order enjoining or otherwise preventing or
declaring invalid or unlawful the construction, occupancy,
maintenance, operation or use of the Project, or any portion thereof,
in the manner required by the terms of this Agreement, or of any
proceedings which could affect the validity or priority of the lien of
the Deed of Trust or any of the other security for the Loan, or which
could materially affect Borrower's ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or Guarantor's
obligations under the Guaranty.

(j)  The attachment, seizure, levy upon or taking of
possession by any receiver, custodian or assignee for the benefit of
creditors of all or a substantial part of the property of Borrower or
Guarantor which is not stayed or dismissed within thirty days after
the occurrence thereof.

(k)  The assignment or attempted assignment of this Agreement
by Borrower without Lender's prior written consent.

11.      EXERCISE OF REMEDIES.

11.1  Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender, in
addition to availing itself of any remedies conferred upon it by law and by the
terms of the Note, the Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents, may pursue
any one or more of the following remedies first, concurrently or successively
with each other and with any other available remedies, it being the intent
hereof that none of such remedies shall be to the exclusion of any others:

(a)  Take possession of the Project and complete the Work and
do anything necessary or desirable in Lender's sole judgment to fulfill
the obligations of Borrower.


28



<PAGE>


hereunder, including either the right to avail itself of and procure
performance of the Construction Contract, any Subcontracts or any
other contract entered into for the performance of all or any portion
of the Work (or any substitute therefor), or to let new or additional
contracts with the same contractors or subcontractors or others, and to
employ watchmen to protect the Project from injury. Without restricting
the generality of the foregoing and for the purposes aforesaid,
Borrower hereby appoints and constitutes Lender its lawful
attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution (i) to complete the
Work in the name of Borrower; (ii) to use portions of the Loan or other
funds which may be reserved, escrowed or set aside for any purposes
hereunder at any time to complete the Work; (iii) to make changes in
the Plans and Specifications which shall be reasonably necessary or
reasonably desirable to complete the Work; (iv) to retain or employ new
general contractors, subcontractors, architects, engineers and
inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; (v) to pay, settle
or compromise all existing bills and claims, which may be liens or
security interests or to avoid such bills and claims becoming liens or
security interests against the Project, or as may be necessary or
desirable for the completion of the Work or for the clearance of title;
(vi) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of
Borrower which may be required by any of the Loan Documents; (vii) to
prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the
Work; (viii) to take such action and require such performance as it
deems necessary under any of the bonds to be furnished pursuant to the
provisions hereof and to make settlements and compromises with the
surety or sureties thereunder, and in connection therewith, to execute
instruments of release and satisfaction; it being understood that the
foregoing power of attorney is coupled with an interest and cannot be
revoked. All sums expended by Lender pursuant to this Article 11 shall
be deemed to have been paid to Borrower and secured by the Deed of
Trust and the other Loan Documents, and shall bear interest at the
Default Rate until repaid to Lender.

(b)     Withhold further disbursements of proceeds of the
Loan.

(c)     Declare the unpaid indebtedness evidenced by the Note
to be immediately due and payable.

(d)     Exercise any of the rights and remedies contained in
this Deed of Trust and/or any of the other Loan Documents and/or
exercise any other rights and remedies that Lender may have at law or
in equity.

(e)     Apply the balance of any deposits made with Lender
toward the repayment of the Loan.

12.      MISCELLANEOUS.

12.1  Additional Indebtedness.  If any advances or payments made by
Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with
disbursements of the Loan, shall exceed the aggregate face amount of the Note,
all such advances and payments shall constitute


29

<PAGE>
additional indebtedness secured by the Deed of Trust and all other security for
the Loan, and shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date advanced
until paid.

12.2     Additional Acts. Borrower shall, upon request, execute and
deliver such further instruments and documents and do such further acts and
things as may be reasonably required to provide to Lender the evidence of and
security for the Loan contemplated by this Agreement.

12.3     Loan Agreement Governs. In the event of any inconsistency
between any provision of this Agreement and any provision of any other Loan
Document, the provision of this Agreement shall govern; provided, however, that
the provisions of all of the Loan Documents shall be construed as an integrated
set of provisions governing the Loan and, accordingly, shall be interpreted and
construed liberally to give the maximum validity, enforceability and effect to
all of such provisions.

12.4     Additional Advances. If an Event of Default shall occur,
Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, take any and all actions to cure
such default, and all amounts expended in so doing, all Loan Expenses and all
other amounts paid or advanced by Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents, and
all other amounts advanced by Lender in connection with the performance of the
Work or preserving any security for the Loan, shall constitute additional
advances of the Loan, shall be secured by the Deed of Trust and all other
security for the Loan, and shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date
advanced until paid.

12.5     Amendment; Waiver; Approval. This Agreement shall not be
amended, modified or supplemented without the written agreement of Borrower and
Lender at the time of such amendment, modification or supplement. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall be
effective unless set forth in writing signed by the party making such waiver,
and any such waiver shall be effective only to the extent therein set forth.
Failure by Lender to insist upon full and prompt performance of any provisions
of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or to take action in the
event of any breach of any such provision or upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default, shall not constitute a waiver of any rights of Lender, and Lender may
at any time thereafter exercise all available rights and remedies with respect
to such breach or Event of Default. Receipt by Lender of any instrument or
document shall not constitute or be deemed to be an approval thereof. Any
approvals required under any of the other Loan Documents must be in writing,
signed by Lender and directed to Borrower.

12.6     Notice. All notices, communications and waivers under this
Loan Agreement shall be in writing and shall be (i) delivered in person or (ii)

third Business Day following the day sent or when actually received.

12.7  Benefit; Assignment.  The rights, powers and remedies of Lender
under this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and
assigns. The rights and obligations of Borrower under this Agreement may not be

harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
claims, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court
costs) of whatever kind or nature which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against Lender at any time which relate to or arise from the
performance of the Work, the offer to rent all or any portion of the Project
and/or the ownership, use, operation or maintenance of the Project, including
without limitation, any brokerage commissions or finder's fees asserted by,
through or under Borrower against Lender with respect


31




<PAGE>
to the making of the Loan and any damages incurred by Lender by reason of the
construction of Borrower and Lender as having the relationship of joint
venturers or partners or Borrower or Lender being deemed to have acted as agent
for the other, except to the extent such liability, obligation, loss, damage,
claim, cost or expense arises or results directly from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Lender, its agents or its representatives following the
date, if any, on which Lender becomes mortgagee in possession of the Project or
if Lender does not become mortgagee in possession of the Project, the date, if
any, on which Lender or its nominee acquires title to the Project. To the
extent the provisions of this Section 12.9 are inconsistent with the terms and
provisions of the Deed of Trust, the provisions of the Deed of Trust shall be
deemed controlling.

12.10    Headings.  The titles and headings of the articles and
paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted as a matter of convenience of
reference only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

12.11    No Partnership or Joint Venture.  Lender, by executing and
performing this Agreement shall not become a partner or joint venturer with
Borrower or any partner of Borrower or any of their respective associates or
affiliates and all inspections of the Project herein provided for are for the
sole benefit of Lender.

12.12    Time is of the Essence.  Time is of the essence of the
payment of all amounts due Lender under this Agreement and performance and
observance by Borrower of each covenant, agreement, provision and term of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

12.13    Invalid Provisions.  In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents
shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, and this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
in the Loan Documents.

12.14    Offset.  Without limitation of any other right or remedy of
Lender hereunder or provided by law, any indebtedness relating to the Project
or its operation and now or hereafter owing to Borrower by Lender (including,
without limitation, any amounts on deposit in any demand, time, savings,
passbook or like account maintained by Borrower with Lender) may be offset and
applied by Lender hereunder, or under the Note, the Deed of Trust or any of the
other Loan Documents.

12.15    Acts by Lender.  Notwithstanding anything herein contained to
the contrary, Lender will not be required to make any disbursement or perform
any other act under this Agreement if, as a result thereof, Lender will
violate any law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or judicial decision
applicable thereto.


32

12.16    Joint and Several Liability; Binding Provisions.  The
obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Agreement shall be joint and

12.17    Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, and all said counterparts when taken together shall constitute
one and the same Agreement.

12.18    No Third Party Borrower.  This Agreement is only for the
benefit of the parties hereto. No other person or entity shall be entitled to
rely on any matter set forth herein without the prior written consent of such
parties.

12.19    Sign.  Subject to compliance with applicable laws, codes and
ordinances, Lender reserves the right to publicize the making of the Loan in
any manner it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, advertisements
in trade journals and newspapers. In addition, Borrower agrees that Lender
shall have the right to erect and maintain a sign at the Project, at Lender's
expense, in a prominent location for the first twelve months of the Loan.
Lender acknowledges and agrees that any public announcement of this Loan will
not be made by Lender without the prior approval of Borrower, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

12.20    WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL.  LENDER AND BORROWER
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS LOAN
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN AND THEREIN WOULD BE BASED UPON DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY COURT PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF ANY SUCH CONTROVERSY WILL BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY
A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

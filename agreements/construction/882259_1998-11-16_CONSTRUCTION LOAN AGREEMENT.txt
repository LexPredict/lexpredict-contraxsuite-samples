inspect  the work  completed  or obtain  other  evidence  required  to
determine satisfactory completion.

B.   There is any lien or  encumbrance  upon the  Premises,  other than the
Mortgage, or Lender has received notice of any other mortgage, lien or

deliver  to  Lender  lien  waivers   from  any  or  all   contractors,
subcontractors,  suppliers or others; or require such other proof that

hereto that, if the VESSEL is not delivered by such future date or if
construction is again delayed for one hundred eighty (180) calendar
days or more (as determined by reference to the BUILDER's Construction
Schedule defined at Article IV, Paragraph 1(c)), the BUYER shall have
the same right of cancellation upon the same terms and conditions as

after the Delivery Date (as such term is defined in Article VII,
Paragraph 1(a)) for any reason, excepting only force majeure delays (as
defined in Article VIII) and Permissible Delays as defined in Paragraph
2, below, then in such event, the BUYER may at its option cancel this
Contract at any time thereafter in accordance with the provisions of
Article XI hereof.

(c)      If delivery of the VESSEL is delayed more than sixty-two (62) calendar

Article XIII, Paragraph 1 of this Contract shall be "Permissible Delays".
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Contract, if any
Permissible Delay would not have come about but for the prolongation of the work
of construction due to any previous unauthorized delays (or accumulation
thereof), then the latter delay shall not be deemed to be a Permissible Delay.

3.       Effect of Cancellation:

case, if the BUYER cancels this Contract under this Article, the BUYER shall not
be entitled to any liquidated damages.

drawings must be given within ten (10) working days after receipt by
the BUYER or its Representative of the BUILDER's revised plans and
drawings. A list of the plans and drawings to be submitted to the BUYER
or its Representative by BUILDER, as aforesaid, and a schedule for
submission of plans and drawings to BUYER for approval shall be
mutually agreed upon between the parties hereto within thirty (30)
calendar days of the Construction Commencement Date.

(b)      When and if the BUYER's Representative shall have arrived at the
Shipyard in accordance with Paragraph 2 of this Article, the BUILDER
may submit the remainder, if any, of the plans and drawings in the
agreed list in accordance with the agreed schedule, to the
Representative for his approval upon mutual written agreement between
the parties hereto. The Representative shall, within ten (10) working
days after receipt thereof, return to the BUILDER one (1) copy of such
plans and drawings with his approval or comments, if any, written
thereon. Approval by the Representative of the plans and drawings duly
submitted to him shall be deemed to be approved by the BUYER for all
purposes of this Contract.

(c)      The BUILDER shall, within thirty (30) calendar days after the
Construction Commencement Date, furnish the BUYER or the Representative
a detailed key event construction schedule showing planned construction
progress of the VESSEL. After approval of the construction schedule by
the BUYER or the Representative within ten (10) working days after
receipt thereof, the construction schedule (herein called either the
"BUILDER's Construction Schedule" or the "Production Construction
Schedule") shall be the basis of interpretation of actual construction
progress of the VESSEL.

(d)      BUYER's approval as aforesaid shall not serve to eliminate or reduce
the obligations of the BUILDER elsewhere contained in this Contract.

2.       Appointment of BUYER's Representative:

The BUYER may send to and maintain at the Shipyard, at the BUYER's own
cost and expense, a representative (herein called the "Representative") who
shall be duly authorized in writing by the BUYER to act on behalf of the BUYER
in connection with modifications of the Specifications, adjustments of the
Contract Price and the Delivery Date, approval of certain plans and drawings,
confirmation of the BUILDER's Construction Schedule, and attendance at the tests
and inspections relating to the VESSEL, for which he is specifically authorized
by the BUYER. The Representative and his assistant(s) shall at all times be
deemed to be employees of the BUYER and not of the BUILDER.

3.       Inspection by Representative:

The necessary inspection of the VESSEL shall be carried out by the
BUYER's Representative, the Classification Society, other regulatory bodies and
the inspection team of the BUILDER throughout the entire period of construction,
in order to ensure that construction of the VESSEL is duly performed in
accordance with this Contract and the Specifications. During construction of the
VESSEL the Representative shall have the right to inspect all work in process,
wherever in the BUILDER's facilities, or any of BUILDER's subcontractors'
facilities, and to attend all tests and inspections of the VESSEL. The BUILDER's
inspection organization shall not report directly to BUILDER's engineering or
production organizations, and shall have a direct line of responsibility to
BUILDER's executive management.

The BUILDER shall give notice to the Representative at least one
working day (24 hours) in advance of the date and place of such tests and
inspections to be attended by him. Failure of the Representative to be present
at such tests and inspections, without justifiable reason, after due notice to
him as above provided shall be deemed to be a waiver of his right to be present.
In such case, the BUYER shall be obligated to accept the results of such tests
or inspections on the basis of the BUILDER's certificate, subject to any
required approval of the Classification Society. Notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary in this Contract, the presence or absence of BUYER's
Representative from any such tests or inspections shall not serve to eliminate
or reduce the obligations of the BUILDER elsewhere contained in this Contract.

In the event that the Representative discovers any construction or
material or workmanship which is not deemed to conform to the requirements of
this Contract and/or the Specifications, the Representative shall promptly give
the BUILDER notice in accordance with Article XXII as to such nonconformity.
Upon receipt of such notice from the Representative, the BUILDER shall promptly
correct such nonconformity. In all working hours during the construction of the
VESSEL until delivery thereof, the Representative and his assistants shall be
given free and ready access to the VESSEL, its equipment and accessories, and to
any other place where work is being done or materials are being processed or
stored in connection with the construction of the VESSEL, including the yards,
workshops, stores and offices of the BUILDER,


11
<PAGE>   15

and the premises of subcontractors of the BUILDER who are doing work or storing
materials in connection with the VESSEL's construction.

If the BUILDER's Quality Assurance and Quality Control is found to miss
a number of major discrepancies during the construction, the BUYER may as it may
deem appropriate supplement the Quality Control coverage by contracting for an
independent service. BUILDER shall be obligated to pay for all costs for the
third party services and shall make necessary corrections or repairs to the
construction for discrepancies discovered by the independent third party as if
the discrepancies were found by BUILDER's own Quality Assurance and Quality
Control organization.

4.       Facilities:

The BUILDER shall furnish, at BUILDER's expense and free of charge to
BUYER, the Representative and his assistant(s) with adequate office space and
such other reasonable facilities according to the Specifications in the Shipyard
as may be necessary to enable them to effectively carry out their duties.

5.       Responsibility of BUYER:

The BUYER's Representative shall carry out his duties hereunder in
accordance with good shipbuilding practice and in such a way as to avoid any
unnecessary increase in building cost or delay in the BUILDER's Construction
Schedule.

The BUYER has the right to request that BUILDER replace any employee or
subcontractor who is deemed unsuitable and unsatisfactory for the proper
progress of the VESSEL's construction. The BUILDER shall promptly effect such
replacement.

6.       Key Personnel:

All Key Personnel of BUILDER who are assigned to the design,
procurement and construction of the VESSEL shall have experience on BUILDER'S
prior new build drilling units, or they shall have prior construction experience
on similar drilling units. In addition BUILDER agrees not to replace previously
accepted Key Personnel without the prior written consent of BUYER, which will
not be unreasonably withheld. Key Personnel shall be defined as engineering and
supervisory personnel of the level of foreman and above.

ARTICLE V - MODIFICATIONS

1.       Modification of Specifications:


12
<PAGE>   16

Within thirty-four (34) calendar days of the Construction Commencement
Date, the Specifications may be modified and/or changed by BUYER as respects
machinery arrangements and/or systems installations without altering the
Contract Price or the Delivery Date if such modifications or changes do not
necessitate structural changes.

The Specifications may also be otherwise modified and/or changed at any
time by written agreement of the parties hereto, provided, that the BUYER and
the BUILDER shall first agree to alterations in the Contract Price and the
Delivery Date, if any, occasioned by or resulting from such modifications and/or
changes. Any such alterations in the Delivery Date as may be mutually agreed in
writing shall be understood to be Permissible Delays as contemplated by Article
III, Paragraph 2. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon such
alteration, if any, to the Contract Price or the Delivery Date, BUILDER shall
proceed with such modification or change and any area of disagreement that
cannot subsequently be resolved between BUILDER and BUYER shall be resolved in
accordance with Paragraph 4 of this Article. Within fifteen (15) calendar days
of BUYER's notification to BUILDER to proceed with modifications or changes to
the Specifications, BUILDER shall notify BUYER in writing of any such
modifications or changes that will have an impact on the Contract Price and/or
the Delivery Date or which otherwise would require issuance of a Change Order to
this Contract, including complete details of the nature of such impact. Failure
of BUILDER to so notify BUYER shall be deemed a waiver of BUILDER's right to
subsequently claim for any change in the Contract Price or the Delivery Date or
issuance of any Change Order associated with such modifications or changes.

Such agreement shall be effected by exchange of letters signed by the
authorized representatives of the parties hereto, which shall constitute
amendments to this Contract and/or Specifications.

The BUILDER may make minor changes to the Specifications, if found
necessary for introduction of improved production methods or otherwise, provided
that the BUILDER shall first obtain the BUYER's written approval thereof.

2.       Change in Class, etc.:

In the event that, after the Construction Commencement Date of the
first JU2000 jack-up drilling unit to be constructed by BUILDER for BUYER, any
requirements as to Class, or as to rules and regulations to which the
construction of the VESSEL is required to conform are altered or changed by the
Classification Society or other regulatory bodies authorized to make such
alterations or changes, then either of the parties hereto, upon receipt of such
information from the Classification Society or such other regulatory bodies,
shall promptly transmit the same to the other in writing, and the BUILDER shall
thereupon incorporate such alterations or changes into the construction of the
VESSEL. Any alterations in the Delivery Date as may be mutually agreed in
writing as a result of such changes shall be understood to be Permissible Delays
as contemplated by Article III, Paragraph 2. However, in the event the parties
are unable to agree upon any adjustment to the Contract Price or the Delivery
Date, BUILDER shall proceed with such alterations and/or changes, as aforesaid,
and any area of disagreement that cannot subsequently be resolved


13
<PAGE>   17
between BUYER and BUILDER shall be resolved in accordance with Paragraph 4 of
this Article.

3.       Changes and/or Modifications on a Time and Material Basis:

In the event the parties agree in writing that any changes,
modifications or alterations are to result in an adjustment of the Contract
Price on a time and materials basis, the labor and material rates applicable
thereto shall be as specified in Exhibit "A" and any change in schedule as may
be agreed in writing shall be understood to constitute Permissible Delays as
contemplated in Article III, Paragraph 2.

Documentation of Reimbursable Costs:

The following documentation for reimbursable costs is required to be
submitted with all invoices:

1.       All labor charges must be supported by original time sheets
submitted with BUILDER's invoice.

2.       The time sheet shall include at a minimum the following
information: date Work was performed; name of employee; hours
worked; pay classification of worker; and work order number or
other reference to the specific work performed on BUYER's
behalf.

3.       Original time sheet shall be signed by a field representative
of BUYER. Time sheets without field approval shall be subject
to non-reimbursement by BUYER, at BUYER's discretion.

4.       Materials purchased from third parties shall be supported by
the original third party invoice.

5.       Invoice shall have a copy of the check on which the payment
was made, or a reference to the check number or other
identifying reference if paid by another method, such as wire
transfer.

6.       Amounts reimbursed shall be net of any discounts or rebates
received by BUILDER.

7.       Invoices for items purchased from companies affiliated with
BUILDER shall be so identified.

8.       Unit prices shall be supported by quantity reports signed by
BUYER's representative indicating the units (quantity) or Work
performed/provided to which the unit prices apply.

4.       Disputes Concerning Changes or Modifications:


14
<PAGE>   18

In the event BUYER desires to implement any modifications, changes or
alterations as contemplated under Paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of this Article and the
parties are unable to agree upon the adjustment in the Contract Price and/or
Delivery Date, if any, BUYER may elect to instruct BUILDER in writing to proceed
with such modifications, changes or alterations and the BUILDER shall promptly
comply with such instruction. In connection with change orders as to which the
parties are unable to agree, BUYER shall have the right to audit at its expense,
either by representative confirmation or original documents, such as time and
material records, or by independent public accountant (or both) all of BUILDER's
records in connection with charges and process of construction. The
determination of the adjustment in the Contract Price and/or Delivery Date
associated with any such alterations and changes which are performed shall, as
respects the areas of disagreement between the parties, be submitted for final
arbitration in accordance with Article XVII hereof. Without prejudice to
Paragraph 1, above, in the event BUILDER and BUYER have not reached agreement by
the Delivery Date upon the adjustment in the Contract Price then any disputed
amount(s) shall be deposited by BUYER in a mutually agreed joint interest
bearing account for BUYER and BUILDER until resolution of such disputed
amount(s). Interest on the principal amount shall be distributed between the
parties in proportion to the amount of principal received upon resolution of the
dispute(s).

5.       Substitution of Materials:

In the event that any of the materials required by the Specifications
or otherwise under this Contract for the construction of the VESSEL cannot be
procured in time to maintain the Delivery Date of the VESSEL, the BUILDER may,
provided that the BUYER so agrees in writing, supply other materials capable of
meeting the requirements of the Classification Society and of the rules,
regulations and requirements with which the construction of the VESSEL must
comply. Any agreement as to such substitution of materials shall be effected in
the manner provided in Paragraph 1 of this Article, and may, likewise, include
alterations in the Contract Price and other terms and conditions of this
Contract occasioned by or resulting from such substitution.

ARTICLE VI - TESTS AND TRIALS

1.       Notices:

The BUILDER shall provide the BUYER at least thirty (30) days prior
notice in accordance with Article XXII of the time and place of each of the
jacking trials, equipment trials, and other specified commissioning which is to
be performed at BUILDER's Shipyard (collectively herein referred to as the
"Tests and Trials") of the VESSEL, and the BUYER shall promptly acknowledge
receipt of such notice(s). The BUYER shall have its Representative on board the


15
<PAGE>   19
VESSEL to witness such Tests and Trials. Failure by the Representative of the
BUYER to attend any portion of the Tests and Trials of the VESSEL after due
notice to the BUYER as provided above shall be deemed to be a waiver by the
BUYER of its right to have its Representative on board the VESSEL at such
portion of the Tests and Trials, and the BUILDER may conduct such portion of the
Tests and Trials without the Representative of the BUYER being present, and in
such case the BUYER shall be obligated to accept the VESSEL on the basis of
certificates of the BUILDER and the Classification Society Surveyor that the
VESSEL, upon completion of such portion of the Tests and Trials, is found to
conform to this Contract and the Specifications with respect to such portion of
the Tests and Trials.

2.       Weather Conditions:

The Tests and Trials shall be carried out under weather conditions
deemed favorable enough in the judgment of the Classification Society Surveyor.
In the event of unfavorable weather on the date(s) specified for the Tests and
Trials, the same shall take place on the first available day thereafter that
weather conditions permit. It is agreed that if during the Tests and Trials of
the VESSEL, the weather should suddenly become so unfavorable that orderly
conduct of the Tests and Trials can no longer be continued in the opinion of the
Classification Society Surveyor, the Tests and Trials shall be discontinued and
postponed until the first favorable weather condition day next following, unless
the BUYER agrees in writing to accept the VESSEL on the basis of the Tests and
Trials already made before such discontinuance occurred.

Any delay of the Tests and Trials caused by such unfavorable weather
conditions shall operate to postpone the Delivery Date by the period of delay
involved and such delay shall be understood to constitute Permissible Delays as
contemplated in Article III, Paragraph 2.

3.       How Conducted:

All expenses in connection with the Tests and Trials, including, but
not limited to fuel oil, lubricating oils and greases (the quality and quantity
of which shall be in accordance with applicable engine specifications) shall be
for the account of the BUILDER, and the BUILDER shall provide at its own expense
the necessary crew to comply with conditions of safe navigation. The Tests and
Trials shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in the Specifications, and
shall prove fulfillment of the performance requirements for the Tests and Trials
as set forth in the Specifications. The course of Tests and Trials shall be
determined by the BUILDER.

4.       Method of Acceptance or Rejection:

(a)      Upon completion of the Tests and Trials, the BUILDER shall give the
BUYER notice in accordance with Article XXII of completion of the Tests


16
<PAGE>   20

and Trials, as and if the BUILDER considers that the results of the
Tests and Trials indicate conformity of the VESSEL to this Contract and
the Specifications in all respects. The BUYER shall, within three (3)
business days after receipt of such notice from the BUILDER, notify the
BUILDER in accordance with Article XXII of its acceptance or rejection
of the VESSEL.

(b)      However, should the results of the Tests and Trials indicate that the
VESSEL, or any part or equipment thereof, does not fully conform to the
requirements of this Contract and/or the Specifications, then the
BUILDER shall promptly take the necessary steps to correct such
nonconformity. Upon completion of correction of such nonconformity, the
BUYER may request a second round of Tests and Trials to test the
nonconformity correction, and in such event the BUILDER shall give the
BUYER not less than three (3) business days prior notice in accordance
with Article XXII of the second round of Tests and Trials of the
VESSEL. Upon successful completion of the second round of Tests and
Trials, the BUYER shall within three (3) business days after receipt of
such notice from the BUILDER, notify the BUILDER in accordance with
Article XXII of its acceptance or rejection of the VESSEL. Any
additional cost for fuel, oils and greases required for the second, or
subsequent, round of Tests and Trials shall be for BUILDER's account.

(c)      In the event that the BUYER rejects the VESSEL, the BUYER shall
indicate in its notice of rejection in what respect the VESSEL, or any
part or equipment thereof, does not conform to this Contract and/or the
Specifications.

(d)      The BUILDER may dispute the rejection of the VESSEL by the BUYER under
this Paragraph, in which case the matter shall be submitted for final
decision by arbitration in accordance with Article XVII hereof.

5.       Effect of Acceptance:

Acceptance of the VESSEL as provided above shall be final and binding
and shall preclude the BUYER from refusing tender of delivery of the VESSEL as
hereinafter provided, if the BUILDER complies with all procedural requirements
for delivery as provided in Article VII hereof.

6.       Disposition of Surplus Consumable Stores:

Should any consumable stores furnished by the BUILDER for the Tests and
Trials remain on board the VESSEL at the time of acceptance thereof by the
BUYER, the BUYER agrees to buy the same from the BUILDER at the original
documented purchase price thereof, and payment by the BUYER shall be effected
within thirty (30) days of receipt from BUILDER of an invoice and supporting
documentation therefore.


17
<PAGE>   21

7.       Installation and Commissioning of OWNER Furnished Equipment:

The BUILDER is required to deliver to the BUYER a complete fully
functioning drilling unit that meets all of the provisions of this Contract and
the Specifications. All equipment shall be installed in the VESSEL and fully
commissioned and tested by the BUILDER according to the requirements of this
Contract, the Specifications and the manufacturers of all of the OFE and the
BUILDER Furnished Equipment ("BFE"). The OFE and BFE shall be installed by the
BUILDER no later than the times called for in the Construction Schedule. The
Construction Schedule shall be agreed between the BUILDER and the BUYER as
called for in the Contract and shall be structured such that there is sufficient
time after installation of all equipment for hook up, commissioning and testing.
The BUILDER shall be responsible for arranging and conducting all hook up,
commissioning and testing activities. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Paragraph, it is recognized that the BUYER has specific responsibility for the
following:

o    To arrange for and pay for the attendance during hook up, commissioning and
testing activities of the appropriate manufacturers representatives.

o    To work with the BUILDER during the development of the commissioning and
testing plan and schedule.

o    To provide on site resources during hook up, testing and commissioning
activities to assist the BUILDER particularly with equipment with which he
is not familiar.

It is also specifically recognized that non-performance of OFE after it
has been properly installed and tested according to the manufacturers
recommendations and the agreed Construction Schedule shall not be grounds for
the assertion by the BUYER of default by the BUILDER.

ARTICLE VII - DELIVERY DATE AND DELIVERY

1.       Time and Place:

(a)      Delivery Date and Place:

The VESSEL shall be delivered by the BUILDER to the BUYER jacked down

(c)               The BUILDER hereby represents and warrants that there shall
not be any retention of title clauses in force and applying to any
Appurtenances and Components provided by the BUILDER and shall use its
best efforts to ensure the same for any Appurtenances and Components
provided by any subcontractor or any other person for incorporation
into the VESSEL. The BUILDER shall promptly (but in any event within
two (2) calendar days) notify the BUYER's Representative in writing in
the event that more than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand United States
Dollars (U.S.$250,000) of Appurtenances and Components under this
Contract are subject to retention of title clauses at any point in time
prior to the Delivery Date.

(d)               Neither the BUILDER nor any subcontractor nor any other person
shall have a lien on any part of the VESSEL, including its
Appurtenances and Components, which have vested in the BUYER under
Article VII, Paragraph 5, or otherwise under this Contract, or on OWNER
Furnished Equipment, for any sum due to the BUILDER, subcontractor or
any other person and the BUILDER shall take all such steps as may be
necessary to ensure that the title of the BUYER and the exclusion of
any such lien are brought to the notice of all subcontractors and other
persons dealing with or transporting any such Appurtenances and
Components, or OWNER Furnished Equipment, which shall include but not
be limited to such notification being contained in all purchase orders
and other documents emanating from the BUILDER.

(e)               No mortgages, charges, liens or encumbrances of whatsoever
nature shall be created or registered against the VESSEL or any part
thereof including its Appurtenances and Components without the prior
written consent of the BUYER.

(f)               The BUILDER shall fully indemnify, defend and hold the BUYER,
its parent, holding and affiliated companies harmless against all and
any consequences including all costs, claims, causes of action,
liabilities, damages and expenses whatsoever arising from such breach

Equipment and the BUILDER shall be responsible for any loss of or
damage to the same and for the cost of storing, handling and
transporting


22
<PAGE>   26
the same and shall effect such additional insurance as may be necessary
to cover the risk of such loss or damage from any cause whatsoever.

(h)               The risk of loss of or damage to the VESSEL, including all
Appurtenances and Components (as defined in this Paragraph 5) and all
OWNER Furnished Equipment shall pass to the BUYER only upon delivery
and acceptance thereof having been completed as stated above; it being
expressly understood that, until such delivery by BUILDER and
acceptance by BUYER is effected, any and all risk of loss of or damage
to the VESSEL, including all Appurtenances and Components (as defined
in this Paragraph 5) and all OWNER Furnished Equipment shall be in the
BUILDER.

6.       Removal of VESSEL:

The BUYER shall take possession of the VESSEL immediately upon delivery
and acceptance thereof and shall remove the VESSEL from the premises of the
Shipyard within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery and acceptance thereof
is effected. If the BUYER shall not remove the VESSEL from the premises of the
Shipyard within the aforesaid thirty (30) calendar days, then, in such event
commencing on the thirty-first (31st) calendar day the BUYER shall pay to the
BUILDER the reasonable mooring charges of the VESSEL.

7.       Export License:

If required, the BUILDER shall be obligated to secure export license(s)
for the VESSEL and shall exercise its best efforts to secure prompt issuance of
any such export license(s) as well as any other required governmental approvals
or authorizations required for removal of the VESSEL from the country of
construction, including the territorial waters thereof. In the event BUILDER has
not secured any required export license(s) for the VESSEL within thirty (30)
calendar days of the Effective Date of this Contract, as defined in Article
XXIII, then BUILDER shall be deemed to be in default under Article XIV and BUYER
may elect, at any time thereafter, to cancel this Contract as provided in
Article XI.

ARTICLE VIII - FORCE MAJEURE DELAYS

1.       Causes of Delay:

If, at any time before actual delivery of the VESSEL, either the
construction of the VESSEL or any performance required as a prerequisite to
delivery of the VESSEL is delayed due to Acts of God; acts of princes or rulers;
requirements of government authorities; war or other hostilities or preparations


23
<PAGE>   27
therefor; revolution, sabotages, general strikes, general lockouts or other
general labor disturbances; floods, typhoons, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms,
lightning or other abnormal weather conditions which prevent work for at least
three (3) consecutive days; earthquakes, tidal waves, explosions, collisions or
strandings, embargoes, import restrictions, defects in materials, machinery or
equipment which could not have been detected by the BUILDER using reasonable
care (provided same did not result from the BUILDER's failure to take the
reasonably necessary measures to avoid any such delay); casting or forging
rejects or the like not due to negligence; unusual delays caused by the
Classification Society or other bodies whose documents are required (provided
same did not result from BUILDER's failure to take the reasonably necessary
measures to avoid any such delay); destruction of or damage to the Shipyard or
works of the BUILDER, its contractors, subcontractors or suppliers, or of or to
the VESSEL or any part thereof, by any causes herein described which in turn
necessarily and actually delay the construction of the VESSEL or the BUILDER's
performance under this Contract, and which could not have been prevented by the
exercise of reasonable diligence on the part of BUILDER, its contractors,
subcontractors or suppliers; then and in any such case, subject to the
provisions of Paragraph 2 below, the date by which the BUYER may either cancel
this Contract under Article III, Paragraph (1)(b) or impose liquidated damages
under Article III, Paragraph 1(c), shall be postponed for a period of time which
shall not exceed the total accumulated time of all such delay, provided in no
event shall local strikes or labor disturbances involving BUILDER's or its
contractors' or subcontractors' employees, acts or defaults of BUILDER's
contractors, subcontractors or suppliers or breach of BUILDER's, its
contractors', subcontractors', or suppliers' warranties or guarantees be
considered as an allowable delay.

2.       Notice of Delay:

As soon as possible and in no event more than five (5) working days
after the date of discovery by the BUILDER of an occurrence of any cause of
delay, on account of which the BUILDER claims that it is entitled under this
Contract to delay, the BUILDER shall notify the BUYER in accordance with Article
XXII of the date such causes of delay occurred and the nature thereof. As soon
as the ending of such cause of delay is known, the BUILDER shall notify the
BUYER in accordance with Article XXII of the date such cause of delay ended. The
BUILDER shall also notify the BUYER in accordance with Article XXII of the
period by which the BUILDER claims an allowable delay by reason of such cause of
delay with all reasonable dispatch after it has been determined. Failure by
BUILDER to give the required notice shall preclude BUILDER's right in such case
to claim allowable delay under this Article.

ARTICLE IX - OWNER FURNISHED EQUIPMENT DELAYS


24
<PAGE>   28
OWNER shall furnish or cause to be furnished to BUILDER at BUILDER's
Shipyard those items of machinery, material and equipment as set forth in the
Specifications to be furnished by OWNER (herein referred to as "OWNER Furnished
Equipment" or "OFE") on or before the time specified for such delivery in the
Contract Specifications (Exhibit "D"). However, BUILDER shall not require OWNER
Furnished Equipment to be delivered to BUILDER's Shipyard prior to the time that
said OWNER Furnished Equipment is required, in BUILDER's reasonable opinion, to
meet the BUILDER's Construction Schedule, as defined herein.

If OWNER's failure to timely deliver OWNER Furnished Equipment to
BUILDER's Shipyard directly causes any delays in the BUILDER's Construction
Schedule, then such delays shall be understood to be Permissible Delays as
contemplated by Article III, Paragraph 2, and the Delivery Date shall be
extended by the equivalent number of days of delay in delivery of such OWNER
Furnished Equipment to BUILDER's Shipyard. (BUILDER agrees, however, to use its
best efforts to proceed with its work on the VESSEL so as to minimize the delay
that may be incurred by reason of late delivery of OWNER Furnished Equipment).
In order to enable BUILDER to efficiently and economically proceed with its work
on the VESSEL, OWNER shall give BUILDER notice of any actual or anticipated
delay in the delivery of OWNER Furnished Equipment to BUILDER's Shipyard.

Should OWNER fail to timely deliver OWNER Furnished Equipment to
BUILDER at BUILDER's Shipyard due to causes other than force majeure (which
shall in this context have the same general meaning as the causes specified in
Paragraph 1 of this Article) and such delay directly results in increased costs
to BUILDER attributable to additional unavoidable physical work on the VESSEL,
OWNER shall reimburse BUILDER for its actual documented cost of such additional
work. BUILDER's entitlement to such reimbursement shall be applicable only in
the event that BUILDER has submitted prior written notice to OWNER that the
delay in delivery of OWNER Furnished Equipment will or may require additional
physical work to be performed on the VESSEL.

ARTICLE X - WARRANTY OF QUALITY

1.       Warranty:

Subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth, the BUILDER warrants
the VESSEL and all components thereof fabricated and/or furnished by the BUILDER
and/or its contractors and/or subcontractors to be free of defects in
workmanship and materials, and the BUILDER undertakes to remedy, free of charge
to the BUYER, any defects in the VESSEL (which term shall include her hull,
legs, machinery, equipment and gear) which are due to defective material and/or
improper workmanship on the part of the BUILDER and/or its contractors and/or
subcontractors as well as any error and/or inadequacy in BUILDER's design work,
if any, and any defects or discrepancies resulting from the failure of


25
<PAGE>   29

the VESSEL to either function properly in accordance with the standards set
forth in the Specifications or to meet the Specifications, provided that the
defects, errors or inadequacies are discovered within a period of twelve (12)
months commencing upon the actual delivery date of the VESSEL.

However, the BUILDER's warranty under and pursuant to this Article
shall not include any defects of or due to machinery and equipment supplied by
BUYER, and installed on the VESSEL, except as respects the consequences of the
BUILDER's and/or its contractors' and/or subcontractors' defective material,
improper workmanship and/or failure to install or incorporate any such equipment
into the VESSEL in a good and workmanlike manner so as to function properly and
in accordance with the Specifications. The BUILDER agrees to deliver and assign
to the BUYER all guarantees and warranties received by it in the purchase of
said machinery and equipment.

2.       Notice of Defects:

The BUYER shall promptly notify the BUILDER in accordance with Article
XXII of any defects for which claim is made under this warranty after the
discovery thereof. The BUYER's notice shall describe the nature and extent of
the defects to the extent known to BUYER. The BUILDER shall promptly acknowledge
receipt of any such notice from BUYER. The BUILDER shall have no obligation for
any defects discovered prior to the expiry date of the said Warranty Period,
unless notice of such defects is received by the BUILDER not later than thirty
(30) days after expiry thereof.

3.       Remedy of Defects:

(a)      The BUILDER shall remedy, at its expense, any defects against which the
VESSEL is warranted under this Article by making all necessary repairs
or replacements at the Shipyard.

(b)      However, if it is impractical to bring the VESSEL to the Shipyard, the
BUYER may cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made
elsewhere which is deemed by BUYER to be suitable for the purpose,
provided that, in such event, the BUILDER may, at its own expense,
forward or supply replacement parts or materials to the VESSEL, unless
forwarding or supplying thereof to the VESSEL would impair or delay the
operation or working schedule of the VESSEL. In the event that the
BUYER proposes to cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be
made to the VESSEL at any other shipyard or location than the Shipyard,
the BUYER shall first, but in all events as soon as possible, give the
BUILDER notice in accordance with Article XXII of the time and place
such repairs will be made, and if the VESSEL is not thereby delayed, or
her operation or working schedule is not thereby impaired, the BUILDER
shall have the right to verify at its own cost and by its own
representative(s) the nature and extent of the defects complained of.
The


26
<PAGE>   30
BUILDER shall, in such case, promptly notify the BUYER in accordance
with Article XXII after such examination has been completed of its
acceptance or rejection of the defects as ones that are covered by the
warranty herein provided. Upon the BUILDER's acceptance of the defects
as justifying remedy under this Article, or upon award of the
arbitration so determining, the BUILDER shall immediately pay to the
BUYER all documented costs incurred for such repairs or replacements.
Provided, that the costs chargeable to BUILDER for repairs or
replacements under this Article shall not exceed three (3) times the
amount that such repairs and replacements would have cost if they had
been carried out by BUILDER at its Shipyard based on BUILDER's normal
rates as published at the time of repairs and/or replacement. Interest
on any unpaid balance due hereunder shall be paid at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per annum, commencing thirty (30) calendar days after
BUILDER's receipt of BUYER's invoice for any amounts due under this
Article and continuing until payment has been remitted to BUYER.

(c)      In any case, the VESSEL shall be taken at the BUYER's cost and
responsibility to the place elected, ready in all respects for such
repairs or replacements.

(d)      Any work performed or any material supplied by BUILDER under this
Article shall be further warranted for the balance of the warranty
period specified in Paragraph 1 of this Article or six (6) months after
completion of such work or supply, whichever is later.

(e)      Any dispute under this Article shall be referred to arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of Article XVII hereof.

4.       Extent of BUILDER's Responsibility:

(a)      The BUILDER shall have no responsibility or liability for any defects
whatsoever in the VESSEL other than the defects specified in this
Article. Nor shall the BUILDER in any circumstances be responsible or
liable for any consequential or special losses, damages or expenses
including, but not limited to, loss of time, loss of profit or earnings
directly or indirectly occasioned to the BUYER due to the defects
specified in this Article or due to repairs or other works done to the
VESSEL to remedy such defects.

(b)      The BUILDER shall not be responsible for any defects in any part of the
VESSEL which have been caused subsequent to delivery of the VESSEL by
any replacement or repair work performed by any other contractor, or
for any defects to the extent the same have been caused by use in
excess of specified design limitations or improper maintenance of the
VESSEL on the part of the BUYER, its servants or agents or by ordinary
wear and tear.


27
<PAGE>   31

(c)      Subject always to the terms of Article XV, the warranty contained
hereinabove in this Article replaces and excludes any other liability,
guarantee, warranty and/or condition imposed or implied by the law,
customary, statutory or otherwise, by reason of the construction and
sale of the VESSEL by the BUILDER for and to the BUYER.

5.       Guarantee Engineer:

The BUILDER shall have the right to appoint a Guarantee Engineer to
serve on the VESSEL as its representative for such portion of the warranty
period as the BUILDER may decide at BUILDER's cost and risk. The BUYER and its
employees shall give the Guarantee Engineer full cooperation in carrying out his
duties as the representative of the BUILDER on board the VESSEL. The BUYER shall
accord the Guarantee Engineer the treatment reasonably comparable to the
VESSEL's Chief Engineer and shall provide him with suitable accommodations and
subsistence at no cost to the BUILDER and/or the Guarantee Engineer.

ARTICLE XI - CANCELLATION BY BUYER

1.       Notice:

The installments and other payments made by the BUYER prior to the
delivery of the VESSEL shall be in the nature of advances to the BUILDER. In the
event that the BUYER shall exercise its right of cancellation of this Contract
under and pursuant to any of the provisions of this Contract specifically
permitting the BUYER to do so, then the BUYER shall notify the BUILDER in
accordance with Article XXII and such cancellation shall be effective as of the
date when notice thereof is received by the BUILDER.

2.       Refund by BUILDER:

Within five (5) business days of receipt of BUYER's notice of
cancellation of this Contract the BUILDER shall refund to the BUYER in U.S.
Dollars the sum of: (a) the full amount of all sums paid by the BUYER to the
BUILDER on account of the VESSEL; and (b) the cost delivered at BUILDER'S
Shipyard of all OWNER Furnished Equipment which has been delivered to BUILDER's
Shipyard for installation in the Vessel unless the BUILDER proceeds to
arbitration under the provisions of Article XVII hereof.

In such event, the BUILDER shall pay the BUYER interest at the rate of
ten percent (10%) per annum on the amount required herein to be refunded to the
BUYER, computed from the respective dates on which either such sums were paid by
the BUYER to the BUILDER or the respective items of OWNER


28
<PAGE>   32
Furnished Equipment were delivered to BUILDER's Shipyard, to the date of
remittance by wire transfer of such refund to the BUYER by the BUILDER.

For purposes of the provisions addressing the BUYER's rights under this
Contract, on or before the Construction Commencement Date the BUILDER shall
provide to the BUYER as partial security for BUILDER's obligations under this
Contract both (i) an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit confirmed by a bank
in the United States acceptable to BUYER, in an amount equivalent to ten percent
(10%) of the Contract Price as defined in Article II, Paragraph 1, and in the
form annexed as Exhibit "C-1", and (ii) an on demand performance bond issued by
underwriters of recognized responsibility and which are subject to written
approval by BUYER, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, in an
amount equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the Contract Price as defined in
Article II, Paragraph 1, and in the form annexed as Exhibit "C-2", both of which
are to be provided in order to partially assure refund to the BUYER of such sums
as are contemplated in this Contract due to any event of BUILDER's default
hereunder including warranties pursuant to Article X.

3.       Discharge of Obligations:

Upon such refund by the BUILDER to the BUYER, and the BUYER's receipt
thereof, title to the VESSEL and all OWNER Furnished Equipment which has been
delivered to the BUILDER's shipyard for installation in the VESSEL shall be
transferred from the BUYER to the BUILDER and the BUYER shall at that time
release the stand-by letter of credit and the performance bond and thereafter
all obligations, duties and liabilities of each of the parties hereto to the
other under this Contract (excluding only the provisions of Articles X, XI, XV,
XVII and XX) shall be forthwith completely discharged.

4.       Termination for BUYER's Convenience:

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, in addition to
any other right that the BUYER may have under the Contract to cancel the
Contract, the BUYER shall have the right to terminate the Contract, at its sole
option, upon notifying the BUILDER in accordance with Article XXII, which notice
may be given at any time prior to actual delivery of the VESSEL by the BUILDER
to the BUYER and acceptance of the VESSEL by the BUYER. In the event the BUYER
exercises such right of termination at any time after the Construction
Commencement Date, the BUYER shall pay the BUILDER within thirty (30) calendar
days of the BUILDER's receipt of such notice BUILDER's documented costs
(including overhead costs and project closure costs) up to the date of
termination, less any installment payments received by BUILDER, plus a lump sum
termination fee calculated as twenty percent (20%) of any remaining installment
payments which are not yet due and payable under the terms of this Contract as
of the date of termination. Provided, however, that the total amount payable by
the BUYER to the BUILDER shall never exceed the Contract Price. Provided,
further, that no fee or cost shall be payable by the BUYER to the


29
<PAGE>   33
BUILDER in respect of BUYER's termination of either this Contract or any other
contracts for construction of a vessel between the BUILDER and the BUYER in
respect of which, at the time of BUYER's notice of termination, the Construction
Commencement Date for such contract has not occurred.

The termination fee as described in the preceding paragraph shall be
the BUYER's sole financial obligation to the BUILDER and the BUILDER's exclusive
remedy in the event of such termination of the Contract. Upon payment by the
BUYER of the applicable termination fee to the BUILDER (or refund by the BUILDER
to the BUYER, as the case may be), the BUILDER shall release the BUYER from any
liability or obligation to reimburse the BUILDER for any costs or damages,
including without limitation, loss of profits or revenues that the BUILDER may
suffer or incur from such termination and the BUYER shall at that time release
the stand-by letter of credit and the performance bond.

ARTICLE XII - SUSPENSION BY BUYER

1.       Suspension of performance for BUYER's convenience:

At the BUYER's sole discretion, the BUYER shall have the recurring
right, exercisable at any time, subject to giving forty-five (45) calendar days

including overhead, to reactivate the construction of the VESSEL.

-    The BUILDER shall immediately and in consultation with the BUYER
revise its work schedule or program so as to reduce as much as
possible the consequences to the BUYER flowing or which may flow
from such suspension.

-    The BUILDER shall use its best endeavors to maintain, redeploy,
transfer or retain its personnel and equipment in any part of the
work not suspended at the same time or in any other work for the
BUYER or its affiliates under other contracts.


30
<PAGE>   34

-    However, no fee or cost shall be payable by the BUYER to the
BUILDER in respect of either this VESSEL or any other vessels that
the BUILDER may have contracted to build for the BUYER in respect
of which at the time of BUYER's notice of suspension the
Construction Commencement Date for such vessel has not occurred.

-    The BUILDER shall notify the BUYER in writing immediately upon the
BUILDER's performance hereunder being suspended, of the date and
time on which the services were suspended and forward to the BUYER
all other particulars which the BUILDER may rely on in making any

be without prejudice to its right to terminate this Contract at
any time in accordance with the provisions of Article XI,

unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.

2.       Recommencement of performance at BUYER's convenience:

-    At the BUYER's sole discretion, the BUYER shall have the recurring
right, exercisable at any time, subject to giving forty-five (45)
calendar days written notice to the BUILDER, to require the
BUILDER to recommence performance which has been suspended under
this Contract in which case the BUILDER shall promptly recommence
all or such part of the performance as specified by BUYER in said
notice.

-    The BUILDER shall notify the BUYER in writing immediately upon the
BUILDER's performance hereunder recommencing following suspension,
of the date and time on which the services were recommenced and

-    The Delivery Date, as defined in Article VII, Paragraph 1(a),

31
<PAGE>   35

ARTICLE XIII - BUYER'S DEFAULT

1.       Definition of Default:

The BUYER shall be deemed to be in default of performance of its
obligations under this Contract in the following cases:

(a)      If the BUYER fails to pay any installments to the BUILDER within five
(5) business days after receipt of notice in accordance with Article
XXII that any such installment became due and payable under the
provisions of Article II hereof; or

(b)      If the BUYER fails to pay the final installment to the BUILDER
concurrently with the delivery of the VESSEL by the BUILDER and
acceptance thereof by the BUYER as provided in Article VII hereof; or

(c)      If the BUYER fails to take delivery of the VESSEL, when the VESSEL is
duly tendered for delivery by the BUILDER under the provisions of
Article VII hereof; or

(d)      If the BUYER goes into liquidation, whether voluntary or compulsory, or
enters into a scheme of arrangement, or makes a general assignment of
its assets for the benefit of its creditors, or appoints a receiver or
receivers of any kind whatsoever, whether temporary or permanent, for
the property of the BUYER, or if the BUYER institutes proceedings for
its reorganization or such proceedings are instituted by creditors and
approved by the court, whether proposed by a creditor, a stockholder or
any other person whomsoever, or if BUYER suffers any execution against
a major portion of its assets which is not satisfied within seven (7)
days.

If any default by BUYER under Paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) above
necessarily and actually causes delays in either the construction of the VESSEL
or any performance required as a prerequisite to delivery of the VESSEL, such
delays shall be understood to be Permissible Delays as contemplated by Article
III, Paragraph 2.

2.       Interest and Charges:

If the BUYER has not made payment as to any installment as provided in
Paragraph 1 (a) and (b) of this Article on its due date, the BUYER shall pay
interest on such installment at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the
due date thereof to the date of payment to the BUILDER of the full amount of
such installments, including interest. In case the BUYER shall fail to take
delivery of the VESSEL as provided in Paragraph 1(c) of this Article, the BUYER
shall pay interest upon the final installment at the same rate as aforesaid from
and including the day upon which the VESSEL is duly tendered for delivery by the
BUILDER. In the event a due date falls on a non-business day of either


32
<PAGE>   36
BUILDER or BUYER, the payment with respect thereto shall be due on the next
succeeding business day of both BUILDER and BUYER.

3.       Effect of BUYER's Default:

(a)      If any default by the BUYER occurs as defined in Paragraph 1 (a), (b)
and (c) of this Article, the Delivery Date shall be automatically
postponed for the period of continuance of such default by the BUYER.

(b)      If any such default by the BUYER continues for a period of five (5)
business days, the BUILDER may, at its option, notify BUYER in
accordance with Article XXII of BUILDER's intention to cancel the
Contract, and if BUYER does not remedy the default within thirty (30)
business days after receipt of such notice, BUILDER may cancel this
Contract by giving notice to such effect to the BUYER in accordance
with Article XXII.

In the event of such cancellation of this Contract, the BUILDER shall
be entitled to retain any installment or installments previously paid
by the BUYER to the BUILDER on account of this Contract (it being
understood by both parties that retention of any such installments by
BUILDER is by way of liquidated damages and not by way of penalty).

(c)      BUYER shall not under any circumstances be responsible or liable to
BUILDER, its contractors or subcontractors, for any consequential or
special losses, damages or expenses including, but not limited to, loss
of time, loss of profit or earnings whether directly or indirectly
arising out of this Contract.

4.       Sale of VESSEL:

(a)      In the event of default by the BUYER pursuant to this Contract as set
forth above, the BUILDER shall have the right either to complete or not
to complete the VESSEL as it deems fit, and to sell the VESSEL at a
public or private sale, upon ten (10) business days prior written
notice to the BUYER in accordance with Article XXII, on such terms and
conditions as the BUILDER deems fit, without being answerable for any
loss or damage.

(b)      In the event of the sale of the VESSEL in a completed state, the
proceeds of sale received by the BUILDER shall be applied first to
payment of all documented expenses attending such sale and otherwise
incurred by the BUILDER as a result of the BUYER's default, and then to
payment of all unpaid installments of the Contract Price and interest
on such installments at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from
the respective due dates thereof to the date of application.


33
<PAGE>   37

(c)      In the event of sale of the VESSEL in an incompleted state, the
proceeds of sale received by the BUILDER shall be applied first to all
documented expenses attending such sale and otherwise incurred by the
BUILDER as a result of the BUYER's default, and then to payment of all
costs of construction of the VESSEL less the installments so retained
by the BUILDER.

(d)      If the proceeds of sale are insufficient to pay such total amounts
payable as aforesaid, the BUYER shall promptly pay the deficiency to
the BUILDER upon written request with interest at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per annum from the date of BUILDER's written request for
payment to the date of BUYER's payment to BUILDER.

(e)      In either of the above events of sale, if the proceeds of sale exceed
the total of amounts to which such proceeds are to be applied as
aforesaid, the BUILDER shall promptly pay the excess to the BUYER with
interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of
sale to the date of payment to BUYER.

The rights conferred upon the BUILDER under the terms of this Article
XIII shall be in lieu of any rights which the BUILDER would have either
at law or in equity upon the happening of the events of default
specified herein, or upon any failure on the part of the BUYER to
perform the undertakings, agreements, and covenants on its part to be
performed hereunder. The failure of the BUILDER to exercise the rights
conferred upon it hereunder in any one or more instances of the
occurrence of an event of default, as hereinabove defined, shall not
constitute a waiver of BUILDER's right subsequently to exercise such
rights under this Contract.

ARTICLE XIV - BUILDER'S DEFAULT

1.       Definition of Default:

The BUILDER shall be deemed to be in default of its obligations under
this Contract if, after BUYER gives five (5) calendar days written notice in
accordance with Article XXII to correct the same, the BUILDER fails in any
respect to observe the provisions of this Contract.

Subject always to the provisions of Article III, so long as BUILDER
takes prompt and reasonable action toward the cure or correction of the
condition complained of, and continues diligently to pursue the said cure or
correction, BUILDER shall not be considered to be in default on account thereof
if it is not possible to correct the breach or defect within said five day
period.

The following shall also be considered to be events of default:


34
<PAGE>   38

(a)      (i)      insolvency or inability of the BUILDER to pay its debts as and
when they fall due; or

(ii)     presentation of a winding-up petition (except for the purpose
of amalgamation or reconstruction when solvent); or

(iii)    issuance of a notice of meeting of members or shareholders for
the passing of a resolution for winding-up or reconstruction
(except for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction when
solvent); or

(iv)     making of a statutory declaration by the directors or similar
officers of the BUILDER that the BUILDER cannot by reason of
its liabilities continue its business; or

(v)      presentation of a petition for judicial management; or

(vi)     making of a proposal to the BUILDER's creditors for a
composition in satisfaction of its debts or a scheme of
arrangement of its affairs; or

(vii)    making a general assignment of the BUILDER's assets for the
benefit of its creditors; or

(viii)   the appointment of a receiver, receiver or manager, or
provisional liquidator; or

(ix)     execution or other process issued on a judgment, direction,
decree or order of any court in favour of a creditor of the
BUILDER is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or

(x)      taking of steps to enter into a standstill or similar
arrangement whereby creditors of the BUILDER agree to give the
BUILDER more time to pay its debts or restructure its debts
either by making installment payments or otherwise; or

(xi)     additionally similar or analogous processes or events under
any applicable law affecting the BUILDER, its assets or its
liabilities; or

(b)      The BUILDER having met or exceeded the allowable delay periods as
provided in Article III, Paragraphs 1(a) or 1(b); or

(c)      Any event of default under any other contracts for the construction of
a vessel between BUILDER, or any of its affiliates, and BUYER, its
parent, holding or affiliated companies or a joint venture in which
BUYER or any one or more of such related companies of BUYER owns at
least a fifty percent (50%) equity interest, which entitles the BUYER
or such other


35
<PAGE>   39
parent, holding, affiliated or joint venture companies of BUYER to
terminate in accordance with the terms thereof; or

(d)      Notwithstanding that the BUILDER hereby represents and warrants that no
circumstances exist that will cause the Singapore governmental
authorities to terminate the BUILDER's lease(s) for its Singapore
shipyard premises while one or more vessels are under construction, if
the BUILDER's rights under such lease(s) are lost or impaired for any
reason other than compulsory acquisition of such property by Singapore
governmental authorities, which loss or impairment prevents or
interferes with BUILDER's performance under this Contract, then the
BUILDER shall pay the BUYER Fifteen Million United States Dollars
(U.S.$15,000,000). It is understood by both parties that such payment
by the BUILDER is by way of liquidated damages and not by way of
penalty. However, the BUILDER shall not be required to pay such sum if
BUILDER meets all of its obligations under this Contract without loss
of quality at an alternative shipyard facility and at no additional
cost to the BUYER. The foregoing liquidated damages shall be in
addition to and without prejudice to the BUYER's rights and remedies
elsewhere set forth in this Contract, specifically including but not
limited to BUYER's rights under Paragraph 2, below.

2.       Effect of BUILDER's Default:

(a)      If any default by the BUILDER occurs as defined in Paragraph 1 of this
Article, BUYER may, at its election, either cancel this Contract as
provided in Article XI, or require BUILDER to deliver possession of the
VESSEL and all of its Appurtenances and Components (as defined in
Article VII, Paragraph 5) to BUYER (and title thereto, to the extent
that title to any such items is not already vested in the BUYER), in
whatever state of completion the same may be at the date of such
election. If BUYER elects to take possession of the VESSEL (and title
thereto, to the extent that title to any such items is not already
vested in the BUYER), as aforesaid, then BUYER may bring such workers
to the Shipyard as BUYER chooses and perform such work as may be
necessary to prepare the VESSEL for removal, and may so remove the
VESSEL from BUILDER's Shipyard to another location for completion or
disposal.

BUYER may thereafter proceed to contract with or employ any other
person or persons to complete the work or any part thereof and provide
any equipment, materials and labor as may be necessary for such
completion.

Upon completion of the work by the BUYER, the BUYER shall document the
cost to the BUYER of completing the work including all expenses,
charges, losses and damages incurred by the BUYER in consequence of and
incidental to the default of the BUILDER.


36
<PAGE>   40

Once BUYER has documented BUYER's cost to complete, BUILDER shall be
entitled to receive, (or shall be required to repay to BUYER, as the
case may be) a sum arrived at in the following manner:

The sum of (a) all progress payments paid by BUYER to BUILDER, plus (b)
BUYER's documented cost of completion, as aforesaid, subtracted from
the Contract Price set forth in Article II, including interest on the
amount receivable (or payable, as the case may be) hereunder at the
rate of ten percent (10%) per annum computed from the time BUYER has
documented its cost to complete the VESSEL to BUILDER until remittance
of the amounts receivable or payable.

The rights conferred upon the BUYER under the terms of this Article XIV
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any rights which
the BUYER would have in either law or equity upon the happening of the
events of default specified herein, or upon any failure on the part of
the BUILDER to perform the undertakings, agreements, and covenants on
its part to be performed hereunder. The failure of the BUYER to
exercise the rights conferred upon it hereunder in any one or more
instances of the occurrence of an event of default, as hereinabove
defined, shall not constitute a waiver of BUYER's right subsequently to
exercise such rights under this Contract.

ARTICLE XV - LIABILITIES AND INDEMNITIES

1.       Liability of BUILDER:

BUILDER hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless BUYER, its
parent, holding and affiliated companies, the owner and operator of the VESSEL,
their employees, directors, officers and agents, including the VESSEL and all
other vessels in the same or associated ownership, against all claims, demands
or causes of action, by all parties or persons whomsoever and whatsoever
including, without limitation, BUILDER and its employees, directors, officers,
agents, contractors and subcontractors and all third persons based on personal
injury, disease or death or property damage or destruction occurring prior to
the delivery to and acceptance by BUYER of the VESSEL arising out of or in any
way related to the performance by BUILDER or any of its contractors or
subcontractors of the work hereunder, regardless of cause, including the sole or
concurrent negligence or fault of BUYER, its employees, directors, officers,
agents or subcontractors, or of a third party, or an event of force majeure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the BUILDER shall be under no liability
whatsoever to the BUYER, the Representative, his assistant(s) or BUYER's
contractors (other than BUILDER) or invitees for personal injuries, including


37
<PAGE>   41
disease and death, suffered by the Representative, his assistant(s) or BUYER's
contractors (other than BUILDER) or invitees during the time when he or they are
on the VESSEL, or within the premises of either the BUILDER or its contractors
or subcontractors, or are otherwise engaged in and about the construction of the
VESSEL, unless such personal injuries, including disease and death, were caused
by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the BUILDER, any of its
employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors. BUYER hereby agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless BUILDER, its employees, directors, officers and
agents against all claims, demands or causes of action for personal injuries,
including disease and death, suffered by BUYER's employees during the time when
they are on the VESSEL, or within the premises of either the BUILDER or its
contractors or subcontractors, or are otherwise engaged in and about the
construction of the VESSEL, unless such personal injuries, including disease and
death, were caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the BUILDER,
any of its employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors. The BUILDER shall
assume liability to the BUYER, the Representative and his assistant(s), BUYER's
contractors (other than BUILDER) and BUYER's invitees for damage to, loss or
destruction of property of the BUYER's Representative, his assistant(s), BUYER's
contractors (other than BUILDER) or BUYER's invitees if such damage, loss or
destruction was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
BUILDER, or of any of its employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors. For
purposes of this Contract, the terms "gross negligence" and "willful misconduct"
are defined as "an intentional act or omission in disregard of harmful avoidable
consequences, or a reckless act or omission in disregard of harmful avoidable
consequences".

2.       Scope of Indemnities:

In all circumstances where responsibility is allocated herein, the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to bear the expense of the investigations
and expenses of all claims or demands or causes of action arising therefrom and
to pay the full amount of any judgment rendered against the indemnified parties,
it being stipulated that all obligations of indemnity assumed herein shall
survive the termination of this Contract, regardless of how such termination is
effected. The indemnifying party shall have the control of the defense and
settlement of all such claims and lawsuits including the selection of attorneys,
the expense of all which shall be borne by it. The indemnified parties shall
provide reasonable assistance to the indemnifying party in relation to the
defense of claims which are subject to indemnity hereunder. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the indemnified parties from participating at their own
expense with counsel of their own choosing in any such defense or settlement.

ARTICLE XVI - INSURANCE

1.       Extent of Insurance Coverage:


38
<PAGE>   42
From the time of Contract signing until the VESSEL is completed,
delivered to and accepted by the BUYER, the BUILDER shall, at its own cost and
expense, keep the VESSEL and all machinery, materials and equipment either
delivered to the Shipyard or being handled by BUILDER for the VESSEL or built
into, or installed in or upon the VESSEL (including all Appurtenances and
Components and all OWNER Furnished Equipment as defined in Article IX), fully
insured under coverage satisfactory to BUYER and corresponding to the American
Institute Clauses for Builder's Risks.

Said Builder's Risks insurance shall include supplemental coverage for
war risks, strikes and earthquakes but BUILDER may elect to self insure such
supplemental coverage for the mutual benefit of BUILDER and BUYER unless it
appears that a circumstance of political instability is imminent, at which time
BUILDER shall cause the standard Builder's Risks policy required hereunder to be
augmented with coverage for war risks, strikes, locked-out workmen, labor
disturbances, riots, civil commotion without deletions of protection and
indemnity and collision clauses, and earthquakes.

The amount of such insurance coverage shall, up to and including the
date and time of delivery of the VESSEL, be in an amount at least equal to, but
not limited to, the aggregate of the payments made by the BUYER to the BUILDER
and the value of any OWNER Furnished Equipment (as defined in Article IX)
delivered to the Shipyard, which OWNER Furnished Equipment (as defined in
Article IX) shall not exceed a delivered value of Forty Million United States
Dollars (U.S. $40,000,000).

The policy referred to hereinabove shall be taken out in the joint
names of the BUILDER and the BUYER and all losses under such policy shall be
payable to the BUILDER and/or the BUYER in accordance with their respective
interests. Any deductible under this insurance policy shall be for the account
of BUILDER.

Notwithstanding the above, the BUYER shall compensate the BUILDER for
the increased insurance cost and expense under or pursuant to any part of this
Article, if any, incurred by the BUILDER due to the BUYER's Default as specified
in Article XIII hereof.

2.       Application of Recovered Amount:

(a)      Partial Loss:

In the event the VESSEL shall be damaged by any insured cause
whatsoever prior to acceptance thereof by the BUYER and in the further
event that such damage shall not constitute an actual or a constructive
total loss of the VESSEL, the BUILDER and/or BUYER shall apply the
amount recovered under the insurance policy referred to in Paragraph 1
of this Article to the repair of such damage satisfactory to the BUYER
and


39
<PAGE>   43
the Classification Society and the regulatory bodies, and the BUYER
shall accept the VESSEL under this Contract if completed in accordance
with this Contract and Specifications.

(b)      Total Loss:

However, in the event that the VESSEL is determined to be an actual or
constructive total loss, the BUILDER shall by the mutual agreement
between the parties hereto, either:

(i)      Proceed in accordance with the terms of this Contract, in
which case the amount recovered under said insurance policy
shall be applied to the reconstruction of the VESSEL's damage,
provided the parties hereto shall have first agreed in writing
as to such reasonable postponement of the Delivery Date and
adjustment of other terms of this Contract including the
Contract Price as may be necessary for the completion of such
reconstruction; or

(ii)     Refund to the BUYER the amount of all installments paid to the
BUILDER under this Contract plus the value of all OWNER
Furnished Equipment (as defined in Article IX) delivered to
the Shipyard with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%)
per annum computed from the date of loss of the VESSEL until
paid to BUYER, whereupon this Contract shall be deemed to be
terminated and all rights, duties, liabilities and obligations
of each of the parties to the other except as contemplated
under Articles XI, XV, XVII and XX shall terminate forthwith.

If the parties hereto fail to reach agreement as contemplated under
Sub-paragraph (b)(i), above, within two (2) months after the VESSEL is
determined to be an actual or constructive total loss, the provisions
of Sub-paragraph (b) (ii), above, shall apply.

3.       Termination of BUILDER's Obligation to Insure:

The BUILDER's obligation to insure the VESSEL hereunder shall cease and
terminate forthwith upon delivery thereof and acceptance by the BUYER.

4.       Supplemental Insurance:

In addition, from the time of Contract signing until the completion,
delivery and acceptance of the VESSEL, BUILDER and its contractors and
subcontractors shall, at their own cost, maintain the following insurances:

(a)      Worker's Compensation and Employer's Liability Insurance affording
benefits as provided by applicable Worker's Compensation Statutes in
the jurisdiction where work is performed, and providing indemnity with
respect


40
<PAGE>   44
to Employer's Liability with limits as required by local laws, but in
no event less than Two Million Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars (U.S.$2,500,000) any one claim arising from any one event.

(b)      Third Party Liability Insurance covering all of BUILDER's operations
and including Automotive, Contractual Liability and Contractor's
Protective Liability with a combined single limit of not less than Five
Million United States Dollars (U.S.$5,000,000) per occurrence of bodily
injury and/or property damage.

(c)      All of the insurances specified in this Article, excepting only
Statutory Worker's Compensation Insurance, shall name BUYER as an
additional assured.

(d)      The underwriters shall be of recognized responsibility and the
policies, the terms of the policies, the insurance companies and
underwriters shall be subject to written approval by BUYER, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Upon BUYER's request at
any time, BUYER shall be furnished copies of such policies or other
evidence of insurance satisfactory to BUYER when obtained by BUILDER
from the underwriters and the receipt for the payment of the current
year's premium.

(e)      Each policy specified in this Article shall include an endorsement
under which the underwriters waive rights of subrogation against the
BUYER, its parent, holding and affiliated companies.

(f)      If the BUILDER shall fail to keep itself insured to the satisfaction of
the BUYER or to produce any such policy or receipt as aforesaid, the
BUYER shall be entitled at the expense of the BUILDER to take up such
insurance or insurances as the BUYER in its absolute discretion deems
necessary to protect its interest and the BUILDER shall be liable to
pay, indemnify and/or reimburse the BUYER forthwith on demand any sums
expended and/or incurred by the BUYER for such purpose.

(g)      The BUILDER shall not do or allow to be done any act or thing which
might invalidate any insurance taken out pursuant to this Agreement.

BUYER may, at BUYER's sole option, terminate this Contract at
any time, and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Contract pay no compensation or reimbursement to BUILDER
whatsoever for any work done after the date of termination.

of America which prohibits directly or indirectly making any
offer, payment, promise to pay or authorizing the payment of
any money or anything of value to any government official,
political party or any candidate for political office for the
purpose of 1) influencing any act or decision of any such
official or party in his, her or its official capacity, 2)
inducing such person to do or omit to do any act in violation
of the lawful duty of such official, 3) securing any improper
advantage or 4) inducing such official or party to use his,

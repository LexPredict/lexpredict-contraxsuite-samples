one single turnkey agreement under the single point responsibility of the EPC
Contractor.

2.2 Agent's Required Actions. Agent hereby unconditionally
covenants that it shall take all actions necessary or desirable for the
Completion of the Facility on or before the Maturity Date pursuant to the Plans
and Specifications therefor and Applicable Law and in


35

Construction Agency Agreement



accordance with the Budget (subject to reimbursement by the Owner Trust), the
Construction Contracts, and the highest standards prevalent in the independent
power generation industry which are reasonable under the circumstances,
including the following services and actions (collectively, the "Required
Actions"):

(a) take all actions or conduct all due diligence, as
applicable (including using highest grade materials and services which
are reasonable under the circumstances for the Facility, constructing
the Facility in accordance with Prudent Industry Practice and in no
event less favorable to the Facility than was or is being applied to
other facilities owned and maintained by or under construction for
Agent or any of its Affiliates and, taking into consideration Owner
Trust's debt financing and standards normally applied, expected or
required by lenders in financing transactions for development and
operation of facilities of a similar type to the Facility, and the
nature of the transaction given the intent of Owner Trust, Agent and
the Secured Parties as set forth in Section 15.1) with regard to Owner
Trust's ownership interest in the Facility or contractual obligations
and rights under the Construction Contracts and otherwise with respect
to the Facility, including any regulatory, tax or legal impact of such
ownership or contractual obligation or right, any foreseeable material
diminution in the Value of the Facility (by reason of environmental or
other regulatory or technological change), the ability of Agent or the
Contractors to Complete the Facility, and any other such application of
Agent's expertise in the independent power generation industry, that
may mitigate the cost or risk to Owner Trust of the Facility;

(b) take all actions or omit to take any actions which
ensure that all material licenses, approvals, entitlements,
authorizations, consents, and permits, and amendments thereto including
those required by Applicable Law and Governmental Authority, will be
obtained with respect to the Facility and the Property and that the
Property is free of all Liens other than Permitted Liens and that all
Liens required to be perfected in favor of the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Participants be perfected as first priority liens, with
only such exceptions as may be permitted hereunder or under the other
Operative Agreements in accordance with the terms thereof;

(c) use Advance Payments or direct Owner Trust to make
Direct Payments for the Completion of the Facility in accordance with
the Budget and in timely manner to ensure that all payments under the
Construction Contracts are paid when due, or to make other Payments in
accordance with the Budget, including Transaction Expenses, but for no
other purposes whatsoever (except as may be specifically agreed by
Owner Trust and Administrative Agent in writing); and in the event that
the Tranche B Lenders do not consent to the amendment of the
Intercreditor Agreement referred to in Section 5.1(e) hereof, arrange
for a refinancing of the Tranche B Commitments to be consummated not
more than thirty (30) days after Agent is informed of the withholding
of such consent whereby after giving effect thereto and to any other
refinancing then consummated, Payments funded from the Tranche A-2
Amount plus the Investments (as


36
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


Defined in the Master Trust Agreement) shall be no less than 15% of the
Outstanding Balance;

(d) take all actions and not omit to take actions which
cause (to the extent it may legally do so) Owner Trust to be in
compliance at all times with the terms and provisions of the Operative
Agreements, the Budget, the Construction Contracts, Applicable Laws and
Insurance Requirements with respect to the Property and the Facility
and give Owner Trust prompt written notice of changes in Applicable
Laws affecting Owner Trust's ownership of the Facility or the
fulfillment of the obligations hereunder or under the Construction
Contracts;

(e) give prompt written notice to Owner Trust and
Administrative Agent of the occurrence of any Agent Default or Agent
Event of Default or any Owner Trust Termination Event after obtaining
actual knowledge thereof;

(f) not take any action which will result in the Value of
the Facility being less than the aggregate amount of all Payments made
by Owner Trust hereunder with respect to the Facility; provided,
however, that this subsection (f) shall not be construed as a guaranty
of the residual value of the Facility;

(g) not take any action or omit to take any action which
could result in any Claim or Imposition against Owner Trust or the
Property under the terms of the Construction Contracts or in connection
with the Facility other than Permitted Liens;

(h) upon the request of Owner Trust, represent Owner Trust
or cooperate with Owner Trust in bringing or defending any Claims or
seeking resolution of any disputes to the same extent as Agent and its
Affiliates would pursue with respect to a similar facility owned or
leased by it and based on prevailing industry practice, whether through
arbitration or other proceeding pursuant to or in connection with any
Construction Contracts; provided, that any fees and expenses incurred
by Agent in connection therewith and resulting from the acts or
failures to act of Agent shall be reimbursed by Owner Trust as part of
the Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitment;

(i) give Owner Trust and Administrative Agent prompt and
full written notice, with such detail and background as Owner Trust or
Administrative Agent may reasonably require, upon Agent obtaining any
knowledge or notice of any Force Majeure Event which could have a
Material Adverse Effect or which could reasonably be expected to result
in a failure to Complete the Facility by the Outside Completion Date,
delay in performance, change in law, breach by Agent or a Contractor,
suspension of work or other event or occurrence which could give rise
to an increase in any payments due or to become due under any
Construction Contracts;


37
<PAGE>

additions to the Facility or any part thereof (subject to Agent's right
to reimbursement from Owner Trust as provided herein) that are required
to be made pursuant to any Applicable Law and Insurance Requirements
("Required Modifications");

(k) without duplication of any actions required under
clause (d) above, take all actions to arrange for the appropriate
insurance coverage required pursuant to the Insurance Requirements;

(l) take all actions and conduct due diligence to ensure,
to the extent possible under Applicable Laws, that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Required Actions result in no
more Taxes to the Indemnified Persons and Secured Parties than if the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements created a loan
directly between Agent and the Secured Parties (including not
permitting the transfer of any Equipment that is the subject of the
Operative Agreements from one location to another if such action would
result in the imposition of any Taxes that are not provided for in the
Budget); and

(m) take all actions necessary to cause title to all
Equipment and other Improvements and all contract rights with respect
thereto under the applicable Purchase Agreements to be transferred to
Owner Trust.

2.3 Scope of Authority. (a) Owner Trust hereby grants to Agent
the authority (the "Scope of Authority") to take directly on behalf of Owner
Trust all Required Actions in order to Complete the Facility; provided, that
Agent's Scope of Authority shall not include:

(i) any action for or on behalf of Owner Trust other than
the Required Actions;

(ii) except as provided in Section 2.1, entering into any
Construction Contracts or other agreement, as agent of Owner Trust,
without the written consent of Owner Trust;

(iii) making any expenditure or binding Owner Trust in any
way not contemplated by the Budget, except for Permitted Modifications,
including Required Modifications; and

(iv) except for Permitted Modifications, submitting or
approving any change order or suspension of work or taking or failing
to take any other action, which has the effect of, or would result in
or have the effect of creating any obligation of Owner Trust to any
Contractor unless included in the Budget or to any other Person under
or with respect to any Construction Contracts without the written
consent of Owner Trust.


38
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


(b) In connection with the performance by Agent of the
Required Actions within the Scope of Authority, Agent acknowledges and agrees
(i) that, as between Owner Trust and Agent, the Property is in Agent's control
and possession during the Term, (ii) that it is responsible as agent for Owner
Trust for the acts and omissions of itself, the Contractors and their respective
agents, and (iii) that Agent has agreed to take all actions and not omit to take
any actions necessary to maintain, or cause to be maintained, the Property so as
to avoid injury or mishap to third Persons. Further, Agent acknowledges and
agrees that in accordance with the terms thereof or the provisions of Section
2.2 or this Section 2.3, all responsibilities and actions to be taken by Owner
Trust under the Construction Contracts have been delegated to, and assumed by,
Agent, subject to Agent's right of reimbursement from Owner Trust pursuant to
the Budget, and are within Agent's control.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
as between Owner Trust and Agent, Agent shall have sole management and control
over the construction means, methods, sequences and procedures with respect to
the construction of the Facility.

2.4 Term. Subject to Article VIII and Section 12.9, this
Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and shall terminate upon the CAA
Termination Date (the "Term").

2.5 Guaranty. The obligations of Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be guaranteed by Guarantor pursuant to the Guaranty in
accordance with its terms. Agent shall deliver the Guaranty on the date hereof,
and the Guaranty shall be maintained in full force and effect at all times
thereafter during the Term, which Guaranty shall be pledged and assigned by
Owner Trust to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties.

ARTICLE III

BUDGET


3.1 Preparation of Budget. With respect to the Facility, on
the Closing Date, the Agent shall submit a Budget substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A, which shall specify the anticipated Completion
Date for the Facility, (x) set forth in Part A, Agent's calculation of the
anticipated Payments to be made by Owner Trust in connection with the Completion
of the Facility pursuant to the Plans and Specifications therefor, and (y) set
forth in Part B, Agent's calculation of the Non-Budget Amounts in accordance
with Section 3.4. Part A of the Budget shall include the following:

(a) The aggregate of scheduled Advance Payments to Agent
and Direct Payments to be made to the Contractors and other third
parties or reimbursements to Agent or its Affiliates in accordance with
specified schedules or schedules to be specified under the Construction
Contracts during the Construction Period (including


39
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


estimates for change orders, modifications and for the inclusion of
additional Subcontractor Agreements and Purchase Agreements);

(b) Other scheduled or anticipated payments in connection
with (but not directly arising from) the Project and/or the
Construction Contracts, such as Taxes, and franchise fees, customs,
duties and related charges, and Transaction Expenses, change orders and
contractual cost escalators and costs and expenses related to hedging
agreements;

(c) A specific amount for contingent payments by Owner
Trust including, among other things, for payments to third parties for
indemnification payments, additional Taxes directly attributed to
activities of Owner Trust unrelated to the Facility and the other
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements or the Financing
Documents, Construction Period penalties, cancellation or other wind-up
expenses, change orders, contractual cost escalators, or other
additional costs Owner Trust may bear as the result of Agent's acts or
failures to act within the Scope of Authority and Required Actions;

(d) An amount for the expected premiums and other costs
associated with insurance that Agent will arrange on Owner Trust's
behalf pursuant to Article VI;

(e) An Allowance for Owner Trust's Cost of Financing (but
excluding any imputed equity yield to Owner Trust or other party);

(f) An amount for reimbursement to Agent for soft costs;
and

(g) an amount to refinance all costs financed under the
Original Agreement.

3.2 Accuracy of Budget. Based upon Agent's experience in the
power generating industry, Agent has concluded, taking into account the
circumstances in existence on the date the Budget was prepared, that the
aggregate amount set forth in the Budget will be sufficient to satisfy all
obligations, including payment obligations, of Owner Trust to successfully
Complete the Facility, and Owner Trust and Secured Parties are relying on such
conclusion of Agent.

3.3 Budget Revisions. Agent may from time to time present to
Owner Trust a revised Budget which changes the Aggregate Owner Trust's
Commitment, and the corresponding Aggregate Lenders' Commitment and Aggregate
Owner Trust's Contribution Commitment, and/or reallocates the dollar amounts of
the line items set forth in any previous Budget; provided, that (a) in no event
shall the combined Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitments for the Facility and the
other projects under the Other CAAs be increased thereby without Owner Trust's
and Administrative Agent's written consent or the combined Aggregate Lender's
Commitments for


40
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


the Facility and the other projects under the Other CAAs be increased thereby
without the written consent of each holder of Lease Indebtedness, (b) in no
event, as a result of any such reallocation, shall the Lease Indebtedness
designated as the Tranche A-1 Amount be outstanding at any time in an amount
greater than 85% of estimated Project Costs; provided, further, that any
proceeds of Lease Indebtedness held in a Project Fund or similar arrangement
granting a lien on such proceeds in favor of the holders of such Lease
Indebtedness until such proceeds are expended in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement shall not be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of the
preceding proviso, and (c) in the event any revision in the Budget would cause
it to exceed 105% of the amount of the Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitment as of
the Closing Date, such revision shall require the approval of 100% of the Bank
Lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). Each such revised Budget
submitted by Agent that complies with the proviso to the preceding sentence
shall be deemed automatically to amend the previous Budget without any further
action by Owner Trust or Agent. Each revised Budget shall be accompanied by
Agent's certification that the revised Budget is sufficient, taking into account
the circumstances in existence on the date the Budget was prepared, to Complete
the Facility.

3.4 Non-Budget Amount. Part B of the Budget submitted by Agent
will also set forth a schedule of estimated amounts agreed to by Agent and Owner
Trust which may be paid by Owner Trust in connection with the Construction
Contracts or the Facility but are outside Part A of the Budget (such estimated
amounts plus any additional amounts actually paid by Owner Trust in connection
with the Construction Contracts or the Facility, collectively, the "Non-Budget
Amounts"). If Owner Trust does not fund or finance such amounts under the
Non-Budget Amounts, Agent may elect to have Owner Trust fund or finance such
costs (excluding those Transaction Expenses described in clause (a) below) under
Part A of the Budget. The Non-Budget Amounts shall include the following:

(a) Transaction Expenses which are not capitalized in
accordance with GAAP, including Owner Trust's fees;

(b) Owner Trust Yield;

(c) An estimated amount for contingent payments to third
parties other than lenders for indemnification payments, additional
taxes, penalties, cancellation or other wind-up expenses, change
orders, contractual cost escalations or other additional costs that
Owner Trust may bear that either (i) are not as the result of Agent's
act or failure to act within its Scope of Authority and Required
Actions, or (ii) would not give rise to an obligation of Agent to Owner
Trust in accordance with Article VIII, Article X or Article XI; and

(d) Agent shall, at no time, be permitted to revise Part B
of the original Budget delivered on the Closing Date without the
written consent of all Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement);
provided, any increase in Part B of such original


41
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


Budget which results in a cumulative increase of said Part B of less
than or equal to 200% shall be permitted.

ARTICLE IV

CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITY

4.1 Construction. Subject to the Operative Agreements, Agent
shall cause the Facility to be constructed and equipped in material compliance
with all requirements of the Plans and Specifications, the applicable
Construction Contracts, Applicable Law and Insurance Requirements.

4.2 Amendments; Modifications. (a) Agent may at any time
revise, amend or modify the Plans and Specifications or the Facility without the
consent of Owner Trust and Administrative Agent; provided, that any such
revisions, amendments or modifications do not (i) result in the Completion Date
of the Facility occurring on or after the Maturity Date, or (ii) result in the
projected Project Cost of the Facility to be funded by the Budget exceeding the
then Available Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitment, or (iii) materially change
the Facility's Intended Use, or (iv) reduce the Value of the Property below that
set forth in the appraisal referenced in Section 7.5(f), or (v) results in a
breach of Agent's obligations under Section 2.2(k) or Section 6.

(b) Agent agrees that it will not implement any revision,
amendment or modification to the Facility or Plans and Specifications for the
Facility if the aggregate effect of such revision, amendment or modification
together with any prior amendments, revisions or modifications would be to
reduce the Value of the Facility as Completed as projected on the Closing Date,
unless such revision, amendment or modification is a Required Modification or
otherwise approved by Owner Trust and Administrative Agent, each such consent to
be granted or withheld in such party's sole discretion.

4.3 Casualty, Condemnation, Force Majeure Events and
Liquidated Damages. If at any time prior to the Completion Date for the Facility
there occurs a Casualty or a Force Majeure Event with respect to the Facility,
or Owner Trust or Agent receives notice of a Condemnation, then, in each case,
Agent shall continue to perform the Required Actions in accordance with Sections
2.2 and 2.3, subject to reimbursement from Owner Trust pursuant to the Budget
and from Net Available Proceeds pursuant to Section 6.3.

4.4 Completion Date Conditions. The occurrence of the
Completion Date with respect to the Facility shall be evidenced by the delivery
to the Administrative Agent, the Certificate of Completion by the Agent in the
form of Exhibit B as attached hereto; provided, that any such Certificate of
Completion shall be with reservation of any and all rights relating to
Completion of the Facility against the EPC Contractor or other Persons in
connection with the


42
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


construction and mobilization of the Facility and is not intended to preclude
the assertion of any such rights against the EPC Contractor or such other
Persons.

ARTICLE V

ADVANCES AND DIRECT PAYMENTS; LETTERS OF CREDIT; AGENT'S DEPOSIT
ACCOUNT COLLATERAL


5.1 Payments Pursuant to Budget. (a) Agent may, from time to
time, deliver to Owner Trust and to Administrative Agent payment
directions/borrowing notices or letter of credit issuance directions (a "Payment
Direction/Borrowing Notice") in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C or other form acceptable to the other applicable Secured Parties for
the purpose of requesting Debt Fundings, or procuring Letters of Credit from
Issuing Bank to secure Bonds issued under the Bond Trust Indenture, the proceeds
of which will be used to make Payments hereunder to refinance or pay Project
Costs that are contemplated by the Budget. The Payment Direction/Borrowing
Notice shall be delivered to the Owner Trust and to the Administrative Agent or
other representative of the applicable holder of Lease Indebtedness, as the case
may be, on or before the time specified in the applicable Financing Documents
for the delivery of such Payment Direction/Borrowing Notice. Advance Payments
shall be made either to the payee or to Agent's bank account in the United
States as set forth on Schedule I hereto, or to such other bank account of Agent
as Agent shall designate in writing to Owner Trust and Administrative Agent.
Agent in turn will be responsible for disbursing Advance Payments to itself or
other Persons. In no event shall there be more than two (2) funding dates during
any calendar month (exclusive of fundings (or deemed fundings pursuant to
Section 5.4) to pay interest on the Lease Indebtedness, Owner Trust Yield,
Additional Costs or the fees described in Section 5.3). In no event shall the
aggregate amount of Payments (including any thereof funded with disbursements
from the Project Fund) outstanding at any time exceed the Aggregate Owner
Trust's Commitment. Each Payment Direction/Borrowing Notice shall request
Payments in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000.

(b) During the term of this Agreement, subject to Section
5.2, Owner Trust may make Direct Payments for the purposes set forth in Section
3.1(c) and (e) or Section 3.4 without the receipt of a Payment
Direction/Borrowing Notice; provided, that Owner Trust agrees to provide to
Agent and either Administrative Agent or the applicable representative of the
holders of other Lease Indebtedness at least five (5) Business Days prior
written notice of any such Direct Payments. This notice will include a summary
of the nature of the Payment, including a statement as to whether the amount is
to be paid in connection with Section 3.1(c) or (e) or Section 3.4.

(c) Subject to Section 7.6, Owner Trust agrees to make
such Payments and cause Letters of Credit to be issued by Issuing Bank in
accordance with each duly completed


43
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


and submitted Payment Direction/Borrowing Notice, cause the applicable Bond
Trustee, on behalf of the applicable Issuer, to make disbursements from the
applicable Project Fund to fund Advance Payments or Direct Payments in
accordance with each duly completed and submitted Disbursement Request and make
Direct Payments, subject to a maximum aggregate limitation equal to the
Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitment. Owner Trust will directly arrange or provide
financing for the Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitment pursuant to the Credit
Agreement, the Bond Documents and, if applicable, the other Financing Documents.
Payments shall be funded by Owner Trust at the direction of Agent from Owner
Trust Contributions and the Tranche A-1 Amount and the Tranche A-2 Amount in the
following proportions: in order that after giving effect to any funding of
Payments from the Tranche A-1 Amount, the aggregate amount of outstanding
Payments funded from the Tranche A-2 Amount and Owner Trust Contributions shall
be at least 12% and 3%, respectively, of all Payments outstanding at such time
and for this purpose shall exclude any Tranche B Amount; provided, that any
draws under Letters of Credit shall be funded entirely by the Letter of Credit
Participants from the Letter of Credit Commitments as set forth in the Credit
Agreement. When the Tranche A Amount is not available for funding, Payments
shall be funded with any unused aggregate Owner Trust's Contribution Commitment.
When the Tranche A Amount and Aggregate Owner Trust's Contribution Commitment
have been exhausted, Payments shall be funded from the Tranche B Amount, such
Tranche B Amount being subject to the requirements of Section 5.1(e) below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the Tranche A Amount under this
Agreement has been exhausted and any portion of the Tranche A Amount under any
Other CAA has not been exhausted, Agent under this Agreement and the agents
under any or all of the Other CAAs may agree to (i) increase the Tranche A-1
Amount and the Tranche A-2 Amount (in the proportions of 87.6% and 12.4%,
respectively) under this Agreement and (ii) decrease the aggregate Tranche A-1
Amount and the Tranche A-2 Amount (in the same relative proportions) under any
or all of the Other CAAs by the same aggregate amount. If the Tranche A Amount
under this Agreement is increased, the Tranche B Amount under this Agreement
shall be decreased in a like amount. If the Tranche A Amount under an Other CAA
is decreased, the Tranche B Amount under such Other CAA shall be increased by a
like amount. By way of illustration of the three previous sentences, if the
Tranche A Amount under this Agreement has been exhausted, but at least
$10,000,000 of the Tranche A Amount under the [_____________] CAA has yet to be
advanced, Agent under this Agreement and the agent under the [_____________] CAA
may agree to (w) increase the Tranche A Amount under this Agreement by
$10,000,000, (x) decrease the Tranche A Amount under the [_____________] CAA by
$10,000,000, and thereby (y) decrease the Tranche B Amount under this Agreement
by $10,000,000 and (z) increase the Tranche B Amount under the [_____________]
CAA by $10,000,000.

(d) Not later than the last Business Day of each quarter
in which a Payment Direction/Borrowing Notice has not been submitted, Agent
shall submit to Owner Trust a quarterly certificate in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit D (a "Quarterly Certificate"); provided, that notwithstanding the
inability of Agent to deliver any such Quarterly Certificate, Agent shall be
entitled to reimbursement from Owner Trust pursuant to the Budget for any costs


44
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


or expenditures incurred by Agent prior to the date on which Agent fails to
deliver the Quarterly Certificate. Agent agrees that it will not incur any costs
or expenditures for which it would be entitled to reimbursement hereunder if at
the time of the proposed incurrence any of its Responsible Officers has Actual
Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that render Agent unable to make the
representations and other statements required to be made in the Quarterly
Certificate.

(e) Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York time, (i) prior to the
Cash Collateral Date, on the date of each requested Advance Payment and as a
condition to such Advance Payment, and upon receipt of notice from Owner Trust
of any Direct Payments to be made by Owner Trust, if such Payment is to be
funded from the Tranche B Amount and (ii) on the Cash Collateral Date and on
each date thereafter when there is an increase in the Outstanding Balance, Agent
shall make a deposit of Deposit Account Collateral with the Deposit Bank in an
amount sufficient to cause the aggregate Deposit Account Collateral on deposit
with the Deposit Bank to be not less than the Minimum Collateral Value as of
such date (such Deposit Account Collateral shall be marked to market by the
Agent upon request, but in no event less than monthly). Such deposits shall be
held and administered in accordance with a Collateral Agreement. Any change in
the composition of the Deposit Account Collateral from U.S. government
securities of a tenor less than ninety (90) days will require the consent of all
applicable Secured Parties. Prior to, and as a condition to, the initial funding
of any Advance Payment constituting a Tranche B Loan, the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be amended and restated in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
the Tranche A-1 Lenders, the Tranche B Lenders (each defined in the Credit
Agreement), Agent and [_____________] Trust, [_____________] Trust, Signal Peak
Trust, [_____________] County Trust, Citicorp USA, Inc. and certain other
authorized representatives.

(f) Amounts utilized to pay down any revolving Lease
Indebtedness under the other Financing Documents to the Secured Parties as
provided in Section 8 of the Intercreditor Agreement in connection with the
receipt of Net Available Proceeds shall, subject to Section 6.3 (d) or (e),
continue to be available to finance the construction, reconstruction, repair or
restoration of the Facility pursuant to Article VI.

(g) In connection with the Completion of the Facility,
Owner Trust may request an Advance Payment, and notwithstanding any other
provisions herein to the contrary, may make repayment on the Loans or Owner
Trust Contributions, in amounts such that, after giving effect thereto, the sum
of the outstanding amounts funded under the Tranche A-1 Amount shall be not more
than 85% of the Final Project Costs less the amount of the Final Project Costs
funded with Tranche B Loans and the Owner Trust Contributions shall be at least
3% of the Final Project Costs. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein to
the contrary, the amount of the Owner Trust Contributions for the Facility shall
equal not less than 3% of the Final Project Costs therefrom.

5.2 Financing Costs and Owner Trust Yield. Agent shall pay to
Owner Trust, solely from funds advanced by Owner Trust, interest due on the
drawn amount of Payments


45
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


funded with Lease Indebtedness (including reimbursement obligations in respect
of drawings under a Letter of Credit to pay interest on the Bond Balances)
(collectively, "Financing Costs"), and Agent shall pay to Owner Trust, solely
from funds advanced by Owner Trust (and unless directed otherwise by Agent,
derived from Owner Trust Contributions), yield on the drawn amount of Payments
funded with Owner Trust Contributions ("Owner Trust Yield") until the CAA
Termination Date at the rate per annum specified in or determined in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Financing Documents and, in the case of Owner
Trust Yield (unless directed otherwise), by capitalizing such amount in
accordance with Section 5.4 without actual payment as provided in such section.

5.3 Fees. (a) During the Term, Agent shall pay to Owner Trust,
solely from funds advanced by Owner Trust, any commitment and other similar fees
payable under the Financing Documents and any other fees in connection with any
other Lease Indebtedness and the undrawn Owners' Contribution Commitments to the
extent provided in the applicable Financing Documents (the "Commitment Fee").
Each Commitment Fee shall be calculated and be payable on the dates and in the
manner set forth in the applicable Financing Documents.

(b) During the Term, as hereinafter provided, Agent shall,
to the extent provided in the applicable Financing Document, pay to Owner Trust,
solely from funds advanced by Owner Trust, (i) a Letter of Credit fee on each
Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank (the "Letter of Credit Fee"), and
(ii) for the account of the Issuing Bank, a fronting fee with respect to each
Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (the "Issuing Bank Fronting Fee").
Each Letter of Credit Fee and Issuing Bank Fronting Fee shall be calculated and
be payable on the dates and in the manner set forth in the applicable Financing
Documents.

(c) During the Term, Agent shall pay to Owner Trust,
solely from funds advanced by Owner Trust, the Bond Fees and any other fees and
expenses computed in the manner, and payable at such times as are, set forth in
the Bond Documents and the Financing Documents as applicable.

5.4 Deemed Funding Requests. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, unless otherwise requested by Agent by delivery of a Payment
Direction/Borrowing Notice to Owner Trust and Administrative Agent or a
Disbursement Request at least three (3) Business Days prior to each Payment Date
or Fee Payment Date, as applicable, Agent shall be deemed to have requested a
Payment in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and theretofore
unpaid indemnity payments described in the parenthetical to the first sentence
of Section 12.1, 12.3(c) or the last sentence of Section 13.9, Financing Costs,
Owner Trust Yield, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Issuing Bank Fronting
Fees, Bond Fees and other like fees payable pursuant to any other Financing
Document (to the extent applicable) and such amount shall be due and payable on
the applicable Payment Date or Fee Payment Date, as applicable, which amount, to
the extent appropriate, but in any event in the case of Owner Trust Yield, shall
not be paid to the applicable payee, but instead such amount shall be
capitalized as of the date set forth above as part of the Funded Budget Amount
(or, with respect to the Owner


46
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


Trust Yield, the Funded Non-Budget Amount) by deeming such amount to be an
Advance Payment hereunder charged to the applicable Commitments.

5.5 Payments to Collateral Agent and Authorized
Representatives. (a) Notwithstanding the terms of the Operative Agreements or
the Financing Documents, any payment required to be made pursuant to any
Operative Agreement or Financing Document by the Agent to Owner Trust, or by
Owner Trust to any Participant out of amounts paid by Agent to Owner Trust,
shall be made directly, to or at the direction of the Collateral Agent to the
extent that the disposition of such Payment is governed by the Intercreditor
Agreement, and otherwise to or as directed by the Authorized Representative of
the Participants entitled to the benefit of such Payment (which direction may
change from time to time), for application in accordance with the terms of the
Operative Agreements or Financing Documents on behalf of the applicable
payee(s).

(b) (i) All payments made by Agent to or at the direction
of or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any such Authorized Representative in
accordance with this Section 5.5 shall be deemed to have been applied by the
Collateral Agent or such Authorized Representative to the purposes for which
such payments were made in accordance with the terms of the Financing Documents
and (ii) upon delivery of good funds to the Collateral Agent or such Authorized
Representative in any such case, Agent's and Owner Trust's payment obligations
in the particular instance shall be deemed satisfied to the extent of the funds
so furnished. All amounts payable to or at the direction of the Collateral Agent
or such Authorized Representative hereunder shall be paid in U.S. Dollars and in
immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date when
due, unless any such date is not a Business Day, in which case payment shall be
due and payable on the next succeeding Business Day (or, as required by the
definition of Interest Period, the next preceding Business Day), at the
Collateral Agent's address as set forth in Schedule I hereto, or at such other
address or to such other Person as the Collateral Agent, from time to time, may
designate to Agent by written instructions.

ARTICLE VI

INSURANCE; CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION

6.1 Coverage. (a) Agent shall arrange for and procure, on
behalf of Owner Trust, and thereafter maintain, all appropriate and
comprehensive public liability, hazard and other "all risk" insurance, with
reputable insurers, of the kinds and in the amounts as set forth in Exhibit F
attached hereto. The cost of such insurance will be paid by Owner Trust in
accordance with the applicable Budget. On or before the Closing Date, Agent
shall deliver to Owner Trust and Administrative Agent certificates of insurance
evidencing the existence of such insurance coverage and naming Collateral Agent,
Certificate Participants, Administrative Agent and Lenders (and Secured Parties
as required by the applicable Financing Documents) as additional insureds.

Construction Agency Agreement


(b) During the Construction Period of a Replacement
Facility subject to earthquake or flood risk, the Agent agrees to acquire
earthquake and/or flood insurance to the extent such insurance is available on a
commercially reasonable basis.

6.2 Adjustment of Losses. Losses, if any, with respect to the
Facility under any property damage policies required to be carried under Section
6.1 shall be adjusted with the insurance companies, including the filing of
appropriate proceedings by Agent if Agent is required by this Agreement to, or
has agreed to, repair the damage to the Property, unless an Agent Event of
Default or Owner Trust Termination Event shall have occurred and be continuing,
in which case losses shall be adjusted by Collateral Agent as assignee of Owner
Trust. Losses shall be adjusted by Collateral Agent as assignee of Owner Trust
in circumstances where Agent is not required to, and has not agreed to, repair
the damage to the Property, unless Agent has purchased the Property pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

6.3 Casualty; Condemnation; Application of Net Available
Proceeds. (a) Subject to Section 6.3(c), the Agent hereby irrevocably assigns to
Collateral Agent as assignee of Owner Trust any award or compensation or
insurance payment or other proceeds (including proceeds of insurance policies
described in Article VI) to which Agent may become entitled by reason of its
interest in the Property or any portion thereof in case of a Casualty or
Condemnation giving rise to such proceeds or other amounts.

(b) The Agent shall, promptly upon a Responsible Officer
obtaining Actual Knowledge thereof, notify the Owner Trust in writing (i) of the
occurrence of any such Casualty or Condemnation when the costs of repair or
restoration of the Facility are expected to exceed $10,000,000 ($2,000,000 if
such event is caused by a Hazardous Condition or a Release or other
Environmental Violation of or noncompliance with Environmental Laws) or (ii)
Agent's determination that there is more than a remote possibility that any
Casualty or Condemnation would result in an Event of Loss, in which case
Administrative Agent and Owner Trust may at any time during the sixty (60) day
period following receipt of such notice under clause (i) or (ii) engage an
Independent Engineer to determine whether or not the Casualty or Condemnation
would constitute an Event of Loss. The Independent Engineer shall issue its
report within ten (10) days from the date of its engagement. If the Independent
Engineer determines that an Event of Loss shall have occurred, then the
Administrative Agent may exercise its rights under Section 6.3(d) or (e), as
applicable. In such event, Owner Trust shall take control of any actions with
regard to compensations for such Casualty or Condemnation. If Administrative
Agent does not exercise such rights or should the Independent Engineer determine
that no Event of Loss exists, the provisions of Section 4.3 shall apply and in
accordance with Section 4.3, Agent shall appear on behalf of Owner Trust in any
proceeding or action to defend, negotiate, prosecute or, consistent with its
obligations under the Required Actions, settle or adjust any claim for any award
or compensation or insurance payment on account of any Casualty or Condemnation
and shall take all appropriate action in connection with any Casualty or
Condemnation, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. Agent shall give Administrative Agent and Owner Trustee
prompt written notice of any such settlement or


48
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


adjustment of any such proceeding, action or claim. Furthermore, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, whether or not the Independent
Engineer is engaged, Agent may commence taking steps to obtain compensation in
respect of any such Casualty or Condemnation and shall diligently prosecute the
same as contemplated above until such time as it is determined that an Event of
Loss has occurred and Owner Trust has exercised its rights under Section 6.3(d)
or (e).

(c) All Net Available Proceeds shall (i) to the extent
less than $20,000,000 per occurrence and so long as no Agent Event of Default or
Owner Trust Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, be paid over to
Agent (unless Agent in its sole discretion elects to have such Net Available
Proceeds paid over to the Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (ii) for the
purpose of repair or restoration to the Facility caused by the applicable
Casualty or Condemnation; provided, that if any such event would have a Material
Adverse Effect, Agent shall consult with Owner Trust and Administrative Agent
prior to commencing any such repairs, and (ii) to the extent equal to or greater
than $20,000,000 per occurrence or if Agent elects to apply such funds under
this clause (ii) or if an Agent Event of Default or Owner Trust Termination
Event has occurred and is continuing, be paid over to the Collateral Agent.
Collateral Agent shall either (i) apply such amounts to the repayment of
revolving Lease Indebtedness in accordance with Section 8 of the Intercreditor
Agreement, and such amounts may be readvanced to pay the costs of repair and
restoration unless an Agent Event of Default or an Owner Trust Termination Event
has occurred and is continuing or (ii) deposit such amounts into a segregated
account and invest such amounts in Permitted Investments (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement). Net Available Proceeds paid over to Collateral Agent
pursuant to this Section 6.3 (so long as no Agent Event of Default or Owner
Trust Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) shall be disbursed (up
to two times per month) to Agent for the purpose of repairing the damage to the
Facility caused by the applicable Casualty or Condemnation. If the damage or
loss exceeds $20,000,000, the Agent shall, as a condition precedent to the
disbursement of additional funds, deliver to Owner Trust a revised Budget
reasonably satisfactory to Owner Trust.

(d) If an Event of Loss occurs due to both (i) Agent's act
or failure to act and (ii) by reason of fraud, misappropriation of funds,
illegal acts or willful misconduct by Agent, at the election of the
Administrative Agent, Agent shall be deemed to have exercised its Purchase
Option under this Agreement and shall pay the Termination Amount in accordance
with Section 10.1 and otherwise comply with the provisions of that Section. If
an Event of Loss would not be covered by the preceding sentence, but would
constitute an Owner Trust Termination Event, the provisions of Article IX shall
apply if so elected by the Administrative Agent. In either case, all Net
Available Proceeds shall be distributed pursuant to Section 8 of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(e) If an Event of Loss occurs that is not due to
circumstances described in (d) above, notwithstanding Agent's obligation under
Section 4.3 herein to perform the Required Actions, at the election of
Administrative Agent, this Agreement shall terminate,


49
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


whereupon Owner Trust shall be relieved of any obligation to make further
payments hereunder or make available to Agent any Net Available Proceeds for the
payment of Project Costs. The Net Available Proceeds and any proceeds realized
from the sale of the Facility will be paid to the Collateral Agent and
distributed in accordance with Section 8 of the Intercreditor Agreement and
Agent shall surrender all of its interest in the Facility to Owner Trust in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit J and thereafter Agent shall
be released from all obligations hereunder and the other Operative Agreements
(other than indemnity obligations which survive in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement), and Agent shall transfer to Owner Trust all of Agent's right,
title and interest in and to the Facility and the Net Available Proceeds.

(a) Organizational Status. Agent (i) is a duly organized
and validly existing limited liability company in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware, (ii) is duly qualified, and if applicable, in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of the
Equipment or any properties and assets now owned or leased by it or the nature
of the business transacted by it requires it to be so qualified, except where
the failure to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) has the power and authority to own its
properties and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged.

(b) Power and Authority. Agent has the power and authority
to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of the Operative
Agreements to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Operative Agreements to
which it is a party, and has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and each
other Operative Agreement to which it is a party on the date that this
representation is made or deemed made, and this Agreement and each other
Operative Agreement to which it is a party constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and general principles of equity.

(c) No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance by Agent of each Operative Agreement to which it is a party nor
compliance with the terms and provisions thereof, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein or therein (i) will contravene any applicable
provision of any Applicable Laws, except for such Applicable


50
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


Laws as Agent shall Contest or that the contravention of which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) will conflict or be inconsistent with or result in
any breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or (other than pursuant to such Financing Documents
to which it is a party) result in the creation or imposition of (or the
obligation to create or impose) any Lien upon any of the property or assets of
Agent pursuant to the terms of any indenture, loan agreement, lease agreement,
mortgage, deed of trust, or other agreement relating to indebtedness for
borrowed money to which Agent is a party or by which it or any of its property
or assets is bound or to which it may be subject, other than as contemplated
hereby or as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) will violate any
provision of the organizational documents of Agent.

(d) Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending or, to the Actual Knowledge of a Responsible Officer of Agent,
threatened (i) that are binding on or otherwise affect in any way the Property
and in which there is a likelihood of an adverse decision that would have a
Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that question the validity, legality or
enforceability of any Operative Agreement to which Agent or Guarantor is a party
or the rights or remedies of Owner Trust or Administrative Agent thereunder.

(e) Governmental Approvals; Compliance with Laws. Except
with respect to approvals which are customarily applied for after the date
hereof and which are anticipated to be obtained in due course or subject to a
Contest, no Governmental Action by any Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over Agent or Owner Trust or the Property is required to authorize
or is required in connection with (i) the execution, delivery and performance by
Owner Trust or by Agent of any Operative Agreement to which it is a party, or
(ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability against Agent of
any Operative Agreement to which it is a party, except in either such case, for
any such Governmental Action the absence of which or the failure to obtain would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. All Governmental Actions, easements and
rights-of-way, including proof and dedication, required for (i) construction of
the Improvements in accordance with the Plans and Specifications and the
Operative Agreements to which it is a party and (ii) the use and operation of
the Facility have either been obtained from the appropriate Governmental
Authorities having jurisdiction or from private parties, as the case may be, or
will be obtained from the appropriate Governmental Authorities having
jurisdiction or from private parties, as the case may be, as and when necessary
for Agent to comply with the Required Actions and in any event prior to the
Completion Date, except for any Governmental Action, the failure of which to
obtain would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Facility and the Property,
as improved in accordance with the Construction Contracts, will at all times
comply in all material respects with all requirements of Applicable Law
(including all applicable zoning and land use laws and Environmental Laws) and
Insurance Requirements, except to the extent such failure to comply with
Applicable Laws would not result in a Material Adverse Effect; provided,
however, that any such failure to comply with Environmental Laws would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Environmental Liability.

Construction Agency Agreement


(f) Investment Company Act. Agent is not an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(g) Public Utility Holding Company Act. Agent (solely as a
consequence of the fulfillment of its obligations under each Operative Agreement
to which it is a party) is not (nor will be) subject to, or is (or will be)
exempt from regulation as a "holding company," a "subsidiary company" of a
"holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended. Based upon its due diligence review,
Agent has concluded that neither Owner Trust nor any Secured Party (solely as a
consequence of the fulfillment of its obligations under the Operative
Agreements) is (nor will be) subject to, or each is (or will be) exempt from
regulation as a "holding company," a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.

(h) Title; Restrictions. Owner Trust shall have a valid
and marketable leasehold interest in and to the Land and a valid and marketable
fee interest in the Improvements, and upon recording of the Ground Lease, free
and clear of Liens (other than Permitted Liens).

(i) Use of Funds; Margin Stock. No part of the proceeds of
any Payment or any Letters of Credit made available to Agent will be used,
directly or indirectly, for any purpose which violates or which would be
inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulations T, U or X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

(j) Defaults. No Agent Default, Agent Event of Default,
Owner Trust Termination Event or Force Majeure Event has occurred and is
continuing hereunder.

(k) Location. Agent shall notify Owner Trust in writing
not less than thirty (30) days prior to any change of its location (as
determined pursuant to Section 9-307 of the UCC).

(l) [Intentionally Omitted.]

(m) Investigation. Owner Trust has made no representation
or warranty whatsoever with respect to the Facility, the Property or that any
information provided to Agent with respect to the Property is accurate, true,
correct, or fit for its intended purpose. Agent acknowledges that it is Agent's
responsibility to determine the existence and nature of all information that may
affect the Property or Agent's obligations under this Agreement.

(n) Regulatory Matters. Owner Trust shall not become
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements solely by virtue of
executing, delivering and performing its obligations under the Operative
Agreements to which it is a party, except for (i) regulation the


52
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


applicability of which depends upon the existence of facts in addition to the
exercise of Owner Trust's rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements
to which it is a party, the ownership of, or the holding of, any interest in the
Facility, and (ii) regulatory requirements with respect to the filing of
construction, safety, and operational reports, the creation and filing of which
shall be a Required Action of Agent.

(o) FIRPTA. The sale or other disposition of the Property,
the Facility or any interest therein by Owner Trust as a result of the exercise
of the Purchase Option or any transfer of the Property or the Facility (or any
interest therein or in an entity owning directly or indirectly the Facility or
the Property) shall not give rise to any Tax under Code Section 897 or
withholding under Code Section 1445.

(p) Budget. The Budget has been prepared in good faith on
the basis of reasonable assumptions and the amounts set forth in the Budget
provide for all of the reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred by Owner
Trust from the Closing Date until the Maturity Date in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(q) Use and Operation of Facility. Except for such as are
reasonably expected to be obtained on or prior to the Completion Date and are
not necessary or required prior thereto or the failure to obtain or maintain of
which will not have a Material Adverse Effect, all agreements, easements and
other rights, public or private, which are necessary to permit the lawful
ownership, use and operation of the Facility pursuant to the Operative
Agreements have been obtained and are in full force and effect and there is no
breach, default, violation, pending modification or cancellation of any of the
same.

(r) Property Related Matters. Upon Completion of the
Improvements in accordance with the Construction Contracts, the Improvements on
the Land will not encroach in any material manner onto any adjoining land
(except as permitted by express written easements or variance) or violate any
material covenant, restriction, right of way, license, agreement or easement
affecting the Property, whether recorded or unrecorded. The Land has legal
access to a public road. There is no action, suit or proceeding (including any
proceeding in condemnation or eminent domain or under applicable Environmental
Law other than as set forth in Schedule III attached hereto) pending or, to
Agent's knowledge, threatened which materially and adversely affects the title
to, or the use, operation or value of, the Facility. No Casualty or Condemnation
with respect to the Property has occurred which would constitute an Event of
Loss.

(s) Taxes. Agent has filed or caused to be filed all
United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns or reports which are
required to have been filed by or on behalf of Agent or its business or
activities as of the Closing Date (taking into account any permitted extensions
taken by Agent) and has timely paid or caused to be paid all taxes due pursuant
to said returns or pursuant to any assessment relating to such taxes, except
such taxes, if any, as are being Contested. As of the Closing Date, no tax liens
have been filed and no claims


53
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


are being asserted with respect to any such taxes which would have a Material
Adverse Effect. As of the Closing Date, the charges, accruals and reserves on
the books of Agent in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are
adequate in all material respects. As of the Closing Date, Agent knows of no
pending investigation of Agent by any taxing authority, nor of any pending but
unassessed tax liability which, in either case, would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(t) Recording and Filing. The Ground Lease (or memorandum
thereof), the Lease, the Memorandum of Lease, the Lessor Mortgage, the Lessee
Mortgage, and the UCC Financing Statements shall be executed and delivered by
all parties thereto and in proper form to be duly recorded or filed, and,
provision for all recording and filing fees and Taxes with respect to any such
recording or filing shall have been made in full on or prior to the Closing Date
and the same will create a valid, perfected first priority security interest and
Lien on the Property in favor of Collateral Agent subject to no other Liens
except in each case for Permitted Liens.

(u) Environmental Compliance.

(i) Except as disclosed in Schedule III, the Facility
complies in all material respects with all Environmental Laws
except to the extent such failure to comply with Environmental
Laws would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Environmental Liability; all necessary Governmental Actions
pursuant to Environmental Laws have been obtained and are in full
force and effect with respect to the Facility, except such
Governmental Actions, customarily obtained or which are permitted
by Applicable Law to be obtained at a later date (in which case
Agent, having completed all appropriate due diligence in
connection therewith, has no reason to believe that such
Governmental Actions will not be granted in the usual course of
business prior to the date that such Governmental Actions are
required by Applicable Law without substantial expense or delay
and without terms or conditions that may have a Material Adverse
Effect) except for any Governmental Action, the failure to obtain
would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and no Environmental
Violation or Hazardous Condition exists that could be reasonably
likely to (A) form the basis of an Environmental Action against
the Facility that would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Environmental Liability or (B) cause the Facility to be
subject to any restrictions on ownership, occupancy, use or
transferability under any Environmental Law except for
restrictions arising under the issued or to be issued
Governmental Actions which would not result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

(ii) No portion of the Facility is listed or, to the
knowledge of Agent, proposed for listing on the NPL or on CERCLIS
or any analogous list of sites requiring investigation or cleanup
which would reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Environmental Liability.


54
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


(iii) Except as disclosed in Schedule III, (A) No
Hazardous Substances that have been generated at or transported
from any portion of the Facility have been disposed at any
location that is listed or proposed for listing on the NPL or on
the CERCLIS or any analogous list where such disposal would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Environmental
Liability, and (B) all Hazardous Substances generated, used,
treated, handled or stored at or transported to or from the
Facility have been disposed of in compliance with all
Environmental Laws and Governmental Actions pursuant to
Environmental Laws, except for such actions that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Environmental
Liability.

(iv) Except as disclosed in Schedule III, Agent has
not received any written notice, mandate, order, Lien or request
which remains pending under an Environmental Law concerning the
Facility or any part thereof or relating to an alleged
Environmental Violation or Environmental Action concerning the
Facility or any part thereof or relating to any potential adverse
action in any way involving human health, safety (including
workplace safety), natural resources, land use or environmental
matters affecting the Facility or any part thereof except for
such notices, mandates, orders, Liens, or requests that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Environmental
Liability.

(v) Except as disclosed in Schedule III, there is no
Environmental Action pending or, to the knowledge of Agent,
threatened against Agent or Owner Trust by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the presence or release of any
Hazardous Substance on or from the Facility or any part thereof
except for such Environmental Actions that would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Environmental Liability.

(vi) Except as disclosed in Schedule III, to the
knowledge of Agent, no Hazardous Substances are present or have
been released from or on or beneath the Facility or any part
thereof or are migrating into the Facility for which remedial
action could reasonably be expected to be required under any
Environmental Law or may be necessary to prevent or eliminate a
significant risk to human health or the environment except for
the presence or release or migration of Hazardous Substances that
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Environmental Liability.

(v) Compliance with Requirements. The Improvements, when
completed, will comply with all material requirements and conditions set forth
in this Agreement and all other material conditions and requirements of the
Operative Agreements.

(w) No Material Misstatements. No information, report,
financial statement, exhibit or schedule with regard to the Property furnished
by Agent to Appraiser


55
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


in connection with the preparation of the Appraisal described in Section 7.5(f)
when taken as a whole, contained any misstatement of a material fact or omitted
to state any material fact with regard to the Property necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were, are
or will be made, not misleading in any material respect on the date as of which
such information is stated or certified.

(x) Ground Lease. The Ground Lease is in full force and
effect and no default or event of default has occurred thereunder. No event has
occurred which gives the Ground Lessor the right to terminate the Ground Lease.

(y) Compliance with Loan Agreement Covenants. Agent will
comply on behalf of Owner Trust, and will cause Owner Trust to comply, with the
covenants contained in Article V of the Loan Agreement dated as of the initial
Bond Closing Date with PEDFA; provided, that this covenant shall not include
Section 5.10 of such Loan Agreement.

7.2 Representations and Warranties of Owner Trust. Owner Trust
hereby represents and warrants to each of the other parties hereto that (a) it
is a business trust duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has the power and authority to carry on
its business as now conducted and to enter into and perform its obligations
under each Operative Agreement to which it is a party, (b) the execution,
delivery and performance of each Operative Agreement to which it is or will be a
party are within Owner Trust's power and have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on its part and neither the execution and delivery thereof by
Owner Trust, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby by
Owner Trust, nor compliance by it with any of the terms and provisions thereof
(i) requires or will require any approval of the holders of trust interests of,
or approval or consent of any holders of any indebtedness or obligations of
Owner Trust (in each case, which approval has not been obtained) or (ii) does or
will contravene or result in any breach of or constitute any default under its
organizational documents, or result in the creation of any Lien upon the
Property, other than any Lien in favor of Collateral Agent and other holders of
Lease Indebtedness under the Security Agreement or any other Financing Document,
(c) each Operative Agreement to which it is a party has been duly executed and
delivered by it and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
enforceable against it in accordance with the terms thereof, subject, in each
case, to enforceability, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other
similar laws affecting enforcement of creditor rights generally (insofar as any
such law relates to the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar event
of Owner Trust) and, as to the availability of specific performance or other
injunctive relief, subject to the discretionary power of a court to deny such
relief and to general equitable principles and (d) there are no actions,
proceedings, claims, suits, investigations, inquiries or similar actions
pending, or to the knowledge of Owner Trust, threatened, against Owner Trust
before any Governmental Authority or arbitral tribunal that question the

that would adversely affect Owner Trust's ability to perform its obligations
under any Operative Agreement to which it is a party.

Bank or Trustee, as the case may be, is or will be a party.

(b) Authorization; No Conflict. The execution, delivery
and performance of each Operative Agreement to which it is or will be a party,
either in its individual capacity or (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery of the Trust Agreement by Owner Trust Parent) as the Trustee, as the
case may be, has been duly authorized by all necessary action on its part and
neither the execution and delivery thereof, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, nor compliance by it with any of the terms
and provisions thereof (i) does or will require any approval or consent of any
trustee or holders of any of its indebtedness or obligations, (ii) does or will
contravene any current United States law, governmental rule or regulation
relating to its banking or trust powers, (iii) does or will contravene or result
in any breach of or constitute any default under, or result in the creation of

be, duly executed and delivered by Bank or Trustee, as the case may be, and the
Trust Agreement and each such other Operative Agreement to which Bank or
Trustee, as the case may be, is a party constitutes, or upon execution and
delivery will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable
against Bank or Trustee, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms
thereof, except as the same may be limited by insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights or by
general equitable principles.

(d) Litigation. There is no action or proceeding pending
or, to its knowledge, threatened to which it is or will be a party, either in
its individual capacity or as Trustee, before any Governmental Authority that,
if adversely determined, would materially and


57
<PAGE>
Construction Agency Agreement


adversely affect its ability, in its individual capacity or as Trustee, to
perform its obligations under the Operative Agreements to which it is a party,
would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of Trustee or
would question the validity or enforceability of any of the Operative Agreements
to which it is or will become a party.

(e) Assignment. It has not assigned or transferred any of
its right, title or interest in or under this Agreement except in accordance
with the Operative Agreements.

7.4 Covenants of Agent. Agent hereby covenants and agrees that
so long as this Agreement is in effect and until all amounts payable by and
obligations of Agent under the Operative Agreements have been paid or performed
in full and Owner Trust's obligations to make Payments shall have terminated or
Agent has exercised the Purchase Option with respect to the Facility:

(a) Preservation of Existence. Agent will preserve and
maintain its existence in the jurisdiction of its formation and all material
authorizations, rights, franchises, privileges, consents, approvals, orders,
licenses, permits, or registrations from any Governmental Authority that are
necessary for the transaction of its businesses, except where the failure to so
preserve and maintain would not have a Material Adverse Effect and except that a
transaction permitted under paragraph (g) shall not constitute a violation of
this covenant; and Agent will qualify and remain qualified to transact business
in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary in view of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties except where the failure
to so qualify or remain qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Payment of Taxes and Other Potential Liens. Agent will
pay and discharge promptly all Taxes, assessments and governmental charges or
levies imposed upon it, upon the Property or any part thereof and upon its
income or profits or any part thereof, except that Agent shall not be required
to pay or cause to be paid any Tax, assessment, charge or levy that is being
Contested or for which the failure to pay does not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) Compliance With Applicable Laws. Agent will comply in
all material respects within the time period, if any, given for such compliance
by the relevant Governmental Authority or Authorities with enforcement
authority, with all Applicable Laws except where being Contested or where
noncompliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and, in addition, if
such compliance involves Environmental Laws, noncompliance would not result in a
Material Environmental Liability.

(d) Books and Records. Agent will keep, or cause to be

survive termination), and Owner Trust shall convey to Agent or its designee its
interest in and possession of the Property, free and clear of all Owner Trust
Liens, the Liens granted by Agent to Owner Trust and by Owner Trust in favor of
the Collateral Agent and any other Liens granted by Owner Trust (other than
those Liens arising or created as a result of actions undertaken or documents or
instruments executed by Owner Trust pursuant to the request of Agent), without
representation or warranty (except the representation and warranty that the
Property is free and clear of all such Liens) and Agent will accept such
interest on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis. If Agent thereupon fails to pay timely the
Termination Amount, Owner Trust may, in addition to all of its other rights and
remedies provided for in this Agreement, pursue all of its other rights and
remedies under Applicable Law, including its right to terminate this Agreement
and the Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitment hereunder and retain its ownership
interest in the Property. Agent shall pay all reasonably documented costs and
expenses reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Owner Trust, including

the five (5) Business Day period or thirty (30) day period, as applicable,

to consummate, the Purchase Option within five (5) Business Days after the date
of such Purchase Option Notice subject to the limitations set forth in the last

Certificate. If Agent has paid or caused to be paid the Termination Amount as
required hereunder, Agent may defer the transfer of title to the Facility for a
reasonable period, not to exceed ninety (90) days, as may be necessary to obtain
any approvals to such title transfer from Governmental Authorities as are
mandatory under Applicable Law. Owner Trust may require as a condition to any
such deferral that it receive an indemnity agreement from Guarantor with such
collateral therefor as Owner Trust, in its sole discretion, deems sufficient.

8.3 Survival. The termination of the Aggregate Owner Trust's
Commitment pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 shall in no event relieve Agent of its
liability and obligations hereunder that accrued prior to such termination, all
of which shall survive any such termination.

8.4 Waivers; Rights Cumulative. No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of Owner Trust, any right, remedy, power or
privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and
privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION BY OWNER TRUST; FAILURE TO COMPLETE


9.1 Owner Trust Termination Events. Agent hereby agrees that
Owner Trust shall have the unconditional right and option to terminate the
Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitment upon the occurrence of any of the following
events ("Owner Trust Termination Events"):

(a) as a direct or indirect result of any act or failure
to act by Agent or any Contractor, the amount of Advance Payments
and Direct Payments required to successfully Complete the Facility
has exceeded, or is reasonably likely to exceed (as determined by
Agent or, at the request of Owner Trust, the Independent Engineer)
the Aggregate Owner Trust's Commitment (or the Budget, as from time
to time revised pursuant to this Agreement);

(b) in circumstances where an Agent Default or an Agent
Event of Default does not exist, Agent has failed, or is reasonably
likely to fail (despite Good Faith efforts), to perform the Required
Actions, such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written
notice thereof by Owner Trust to Agent, and such failure has
materially diminished the likelihood that the Facility will be
successfully Completed (i) in accordance with the Budget or (ii) by
the Outside Completion Date;

(c) an event described in Section 8.1 (i)(A) or (j) has
occurred which does not constitute an Agent Event of Default solely
by reason of the failure to meet the causation requirement in either
of clauses (i) and (ii) therein or an event described in Section
8.1(e) or (f) has occurred which does not constitute an Agent Event
of Default solely by reason of the failure to meet the causation
requirement in either of clauses (A) and (B) set forth; provided,
however, that any such failure in respect of a Special Provision
shall constitute an Owner Trust Termination Event hereunder only if
(x) the applicable Benefited Secured Parties holding not less than
50.1% of the related Lease Indebtedness shall have elected to treat
such failure as an Owner Trust Termination Event and (y) such
related Lease Indebtedness shall have been accelerated in accordance
with the terms of the related Financing Documents; or

(d) the occurrence of (i) an Owner Trust Termination
Event under any of the Other CAAs, or (ii) a Lease Event of Default
under any of the Other Leases which does not constitute an Agent
Event of Default solely by reason of the failure to meet the
causation requirements described in clauses (i) and (ii) set forth
in Section 8.1(g)(3), and in connection therewith the applicable
Agent or Lessee has not within the applicable time period exercised
its Purchase Option thereunder, and if such Purchase Option is
elected, such Agent or Lessee, as the case may be, has not
consummated such purchase within the applicable time period.

Construction Agency Agreement


In any such case, and during its continuance, Agent, Administrative Agent and
Owner Trust (but only with the unanimous consent of the Participants if such
revision would result in an increase of the Commitments above the Aggregate
Owner Trust Commitments) may mutually agree to a revised Budget which will
permit successful Completion of the Facility, in which case Owner Trust will
rescind the termination.

9.2 Owner Trust Termination Notice. Upon the occurrence and
the continuance of any such Owner Trust Termination Event, Owner Trust (or, if
such event arises under Section 9.1(c) or (d), the Collateral Agent, subject to
the Intercreditor Agreement) shall deliver to Agent a written notice specifying
in reasonable detail the nature of the Owner Trust Termination Event (the "Owner
Trust Termination Notice"). Agent shall have thirty (30) days following the
delivery of the Owner Trust Termination Notice in which to exercise the Purchase
Option by delivery of a Purchase Option Notice pursuant to Article X, for the
purchase of the Property or the Facility. If Agent fails to exercise the
Purchase Option, Owner Trust may exercise the Remarketing Requirement.

9.3 Compliance with Required Actions. For purposes of
determining whether an Owner Trust Termination Event has occurred and continues,
giving Owner Trust the right to issue an Owner Trust Termination Notice, Owner
Trust shall be entitled to deliver a notice pursuant to Section 9.1(b) based
upon any failure by Agent to comply with or perform the Required Actions
(provided that all the other conditions set forth in such Section 9.1(b) are
satisfied) even though such failure to comply with or perform the Required
Actions in and of itself would not restrict or limit Agent's right to request
draws under this Agreement because such failure would not result in a Material
Adverse Effect which prevents Agent from satisfying the conditions to such
payment.

ARTICLE X

AGENT'S OPTIONS


10.1 Purchase Option.

(a) Exercise of Purchase Option. Owner Trust hereby
grants to Agent the unconditional right and option (the "Purchase Option") to
purchase and acquire on any Business Day (provided that an Agent Event of
Default described in clause (c) or (d) of Section 8.1 has not occurred and is
not continuing) during the Term from:

(i) Owner Trust, all of Owner Trust's right, title
and interest in and to the Property ("Asset Purchase") for a
price equal to the Termination Amount; provided, that with the
consent of the Collateral Agent, Owner Trust may accept
Agent's indemnity and undertaking to pay all expenses and
costs that



71
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


are expected to be incurred and which are included in the
Termination Amount but which are not due on the date of
purchase, or

(ii) Owner Trust Parent, all of Owner Trust Parent's
right, title and interest in, to and under its beneficial
interests in Owner Trust ("Upstream Purchase"), for a purchase
price equal to the Termination Amount which would have been
payable had Agent elected the Asset Purchase pursuant to
Section 10.1(a)(i); provided, that with the consent of the
Collateral Agent, Owner Trust may accept Agent's indemnity and
undertaking to pay all expenses and costs that are expected to
be incurred and which are included in the Termination Amount
but which are not due on the date of purchase;

The Purchase Option may be exercised by delivery to Owner Trust of a written
notice of the exercise of such Purchase Option (the "Purchase Option Notice")
and a certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G ("Purchase Option
Certificate"). In the event that Agent is unable to deliver the Purchase Option
Certificate, any exercise of the Purchase Option with respect to the Property
shall be conditioned upon the simultaneous exercise by each Agent of its
purchase options under the respective Other CAAs or Other Leases and each
Replacement Facility with respect to the Signal Peak Facility, the
[_____________] Facility, the [_____________] Facility and each Replacement
Facility, respectively, or the ownership interests in the related Owner Trusts.
Owner Trust and Owner Trust Parent agree to cooperate with Agent to cause any
Purchase Option to be consummated.

(b) Payment of Termination Amount. Any Termination Amount that
may be due and payable from time to time in connection with the exercise of the
Purchase Option, shall be paid in cash only, except as expressly permitted by
Financing Documents governing any Lease Indebtedness with respect to portions of
the Termination Amount payable to the relevant Secured Parties. Any cash
payments to be made to Owner Trust upon the exercise of the Purchase Option
shall be deemed to be prepayments of the aggregate amount of all Payments made
by Owner Trust hereunder, have been assigned by Owner Trust to Collateral Agent
and shall be paid by Agent to Collateral Agent to be applied in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement.

(c) Appointment of Designee. From time to time and upon not
less than five (5) days prior written notice to Owner Trust, Agent may assign
the Purchase Option to another Designee; provided that (i) such assignment is
permitted under the applicable Construction Contracts and (ii) notwithstanding
any such assignment Agent shall not be released of any obligation under this
Agreement until such Purchase Option is consummated as provided in Section
10.1(d).

(d) Closing. Closing of a purchase and sale pursuant to
Section 8.2, 9.2 or 10.1(a) shall be conducted at the offices of Chadbourne &
Parke LLP, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112, or at such other
location as may be mutually agreed upon by



72
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


Owner Trust, Administrative Agent and Agent within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a Purchase Option Notice (but in no event later than the Maturity
Date) if the Purchase Option Notice is given pursuant to Section 9.2, on the
date specified in Section 8.2(b) if the Purchase Option is exercised pursuant
thereto, and on or prior to the Maturity Date in all other cases. At closing, as
appropriate, (i) in the case of an Asset Purchase, Owner Trust will sell and
assign to Agent or its Designee by a Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption
Agreement in the form of Exhibit H attached hereto (the "Purchase Option
Assignment"), or other mutually acceptable appropriate documentation, all of
Owner Trust's right, title and interest in, to and under the Property, (ii) in
the case of the Upstream Purchase, Owner Trust Parent will sell and assign to
Agent or its Designee, all of Owner Trust Parent's right, title and interest in,
to and under the ownership interest in Owner Trust, in each case with no
representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind whatsoever (except for the
representations and warranties set forth in the Purchase Option Assignment),
Agent agreeing for itself and its Designee that such transfer shall be (except
as to the representations and warranties set forth in the Purchase Option
Assignment) AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH ALL FAULTS OF ALL AND ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, and
(iii) Agent (or Agent's Designee, as the case may be) shall make payment of the
Termination Amount in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement (but excluding
reasonably anticipated expenses and costs referred to in the definition of
Termination Amount to the extent assumed by Agent or its Designee, with Agent
remaining obligated with respect thereto hereunder; and provided, that an Agent
Event of Default described in clause (c) or (d) of Section 8.1 has not occurred
and is continuing) to Owner Trust. Owner Trust, Collateral Agent and
Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall, at Agent's or its Designee's
expense, execute and deliver such UCC termination statements, releases,
reconveyances and other documentation, in each case with no representations,
warranties or covenants of any kind, as shall be reasonably requested by Agent
to effect the termination and release of the Liens granted by Agent to Owner
Trust and by Owner Trust in favor of Collateral Agent and other Liens created by
Owner Trust. Once the Purchase Option has been exercised and the Termination
Amount as described in Section 10.1(a)(i) paid (provided that an Agent Event of
Default described in clause (c) or (d) of Section 8.1 has not occurred and is
continuing) (including, if applicable, by any assumption described in Section
10.1(b) above implemented in accordance with such Section) with respect to the
Property, this Agreement shall terminate (except for those provisions which
expressly survive such termination or to the extent assumed pursuant to Section
10.1). All reasonable charges incident to such conveyance, including reasonable
attorneys' fees that may be imposed by reason of such conveyance and assignment
and the delivery of such assignments, shall be paid by Agent.

(e) Taxes. Agent hereby agrees that it shall pay all Transfer
Taxes (and indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Person on an
After Tax Basis against all Transfer Taxes required to be paid by such
Indemnified Person on its behalf or on behalf of any other Person) incurred as a
result of the transfer of the Property (or any interest therein or in any entity



73
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


owning directly or indirectly the Property) as a result of the exercise of the
Purchase Option or any other transfer of the Property (or any interest therein
or in an entity owning directly or indirectly the Property) requested or
consented to by Agent, and any liability (including penalties, interest and
expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto (including from any
obligation to file any Tax return, report or statement with respect to any such
Transfer Taxes and any liability an Indemnified Person may incur or be required
to pay in respect of Transfer Taxes pursuant to the Credit Agreement). Agent
hereby agrees that if it exercises the Purchase Option or otherwise requests a
transfer of the Property (or any interest therein or in any entity which owns
directly or indirectly the Property) it shall increase the purchase price by an
amount so that after deducting all Taxes that are required to be paid by Owner
Trust or any other transferor or withheld from the purchase price, the purchase
price (after being reduced for applicable Taxes) equals the purchase price that
was otherwise due.

(f) Deemed Exercise of Purchase Option. In the event that
Agent has informed Owner Trust of its intent to exercise either the Purchase
Option or the Lease Option with respect to the Property at least sixty (60) days
prior to the scheduled date of Completion of the Facility, Agent shall have the
right to give notice to Owner Trust of its election to exercise its Lease Option
no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date of Completion of the Facility.
Failure to elect to exercise the Lease Option by such date shall automatically
be deemed to be an exercise by Agent of its Purchase Option with respect to the
Property.

(g) Closing of Upstream Purchase. In connection with any
Upstream Purchase requested by Agent, upon payment of the applicable Termination
Amount, Owner Trust Parent agrees to transfer to Agent or its Designee all of
its ownership interests in Owner Trust, upon consummation of the closing with
respect thereto in accordance with the terms of Section 10.1(d); provided, that
all references to the "Facility" shall be deemed to refer to the Owner Trust
Parent's ownership interests in Owner Trust. Upon such transfer, Owner Trust
Parent shall be deemed to have made the representations and warranties set forth
in the Purchase Option Assignment.

(h) Conveyance of Certain Property. At any time, Agent shall
have, and is hereby granted by Owner Trust, an option to receive an assignment
(or to have its Designee receive an assignment), from time to time, from Owner
Trust all of Owner Trust's right, title and interest in and to (i) substations
and related assets assigned and conveyed to electricity providers and
transmission companies and (ii) any other improvements and related appurtenant
rights for transmission lines, switchyards and related transmission systems, gas
and water pipelines and other pipelines, interconnection lines and equipment and
other conduits from the Facility located on or extending off the Land in order
that same may be conveyed to utility providers and/or fuel suppliers, including
electricity and other utility supply lines which will not be owned by either
Owner Trust or Agent, in either case pursuant to this clause (ii), or other
property having a value not in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate for this
Facility, in exchange in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) for the right to use,
pursuant to long term contracts consistent with Prudent Industry Practice such
improvements or property in connection with the operation of the Facility. Such
option may be exercised by Agent by delivery to Owner Trust of written notice,
which notice shall contain a description of the Property to be assigned or



74

Construction Agency Agreement


conveyed. Owner Trust agrees, within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice
from Agent, to release its interest in such assigned improvements from the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and shall execute and deliver any documents
reasonably requested by Agent to accomplish the same, in each case without
recourse, representation or warranty of any kind, at the cost and expense of
Agent. In the case of any such assignment, Agent shall indemnify Indemnified
Persons as provided in Section 10.1(e).

(i) Grants of Easements and Releases, Etc. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary provided for herein and provided that no Agent Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Agent shall have the right from
time to time and Owner Trust hereby consents to the following actions by Agent,
in the name and stead of Owner Trust, but at Agent's sole cost and expense: (a)
the sale, grant or conveyance of easements, licenses, rights-of-way and other
rights, interests and privileges of any kind or nature reasonably necessary or
desirable for the construction, use, operation, remediation, repair, renovation
or maintenance of the Facility as herein provided (prior to the Lien of the
Security Documents); (b) the release of existing easements or other rights in
the nature of easements, which release shall not harm the Facility; (c) the
dedication or transfer of portions of the Land not necessary for the
Improvements for road, highway or other public purposes (free of the Lien of the
Security Documents); (d) the execution of petitions to have the Land annexed to
any municipal corporation or utility district (free of the Lien of the Security
Documents); (e) the execution of amendments to any covenants and restrictions
affecting the Land (prior to the Lien of the Security Documents); (f) easements,
licenses, rights-of-way, and other rights, interests and privileges as may be
required by Governmental Authorities in connection with an Environmental Action;
and (g) the release of any portion of the Facility that is obsolete or not
necessary in the commercial operation of the Facility in accordance with Prudent
Industry Practice; provided, that in each case Agent shall have delivered to
Owner Trust a Responsible Officer's certificate stating that: (i) such grant,
release, dedication or transfer does not prohibit the Intended Use or materially
impair the Value, utility or remaining useful life of the Facility or (except as
provided hereinabove) the Liens created under the Operative Agreements, (ii) as
applicable, such grant, release, dedication or transfer is necessary in
connection with the construction, use, maintenance, alteration, renovation or
improvement or operation of the Facility or such affected portion of the
Facility or the Land is obsolete or not necessary, (iii) Agent shall remain
obligated under this Agreement and under any instrument executed by Agent
consenting to the assignment or release of Owner Trust's interest in this
Agreement as security for indebtedness, in each such case in accordance with
their terms, as though such grant, release, dedication or transfer, had not been
effected, (iv) Agent shall pay and perform any obligations of Owner Trust and
the Participants under such grant, release, dedication or transfer and (v) Agent
agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Persons in respect thereof as provided in
Article XII. Without limiting the effectiveness of the foregoing, provided, that
no Agent Event of Default or Owner Trust Termination Event shall have occurred
and be continuing, Owner Trust shall, upon the request of Agent, and at Agent's
sole cost and expense, execute and deliver any instruments necessary or
appropriate to confirm any such grant, release, dedication or transfer to any
Person permitted

and in each case without recourse, representation or warranty of any kind.

10.2 Lease Option. Agent shall have the option (the "Lease
Option"), exercisable by written notice of such exercise to Owner Trust not
later than the sixtieth (60th) day (or thirtieth (30th) day, if Agent informed
Owner Trust of its intent to exercise the Purchase Option or Lease Option
pursuant to Section 10.1(f)) prior to the scheduled date of Completion of the
Facility, to cause Owner Trust to enter with Agent on or before the Completion

respect thereto in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Owner
Trust and Administrative Agent;

(b) no Agent Default, Agent Event of Default or Owner

the supplement to the Lease (the "Lease Commencement Date") and all
related agreements and instruments, the term of the Lease shall
commence and the Termination Date shall be extended to the

shall be a condition to such extension and to the execution and
delivery of the supplement to the Lease and the related agreements
and instruments that Agent shall have confirmed in writing to Owner
Trust and Administrative Agent that (i) no Agent Default, Agent
Event of Default or Owner Trust Termination Event shall have
occurred and be continuing and (ii) that its and Guarantor's
representations and warranties in this Agreement and the other
Operative Agreements are true and correct in all material respects
as if made on and as of the Lease Commencement Date (except for
those representations or warranties or parts thereof that, by their
terms, expressly relate solely to a specific date, in which case
such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of such specific date); and

(d) if Agent exercises the Lease Option, all of Agent's
obligations hereunder shall continue until the Completion Date and
the Deposit Account Collateral, including the Collateral Agreement,
shall remain in place until such time as all of the provisions of
this Section 10.2 and Exhibit I hereto have been satisfied, at which
time this Agreement shall terminate (except for those provisions
which expressly survive such termination).

(except for those provisions which expressly survive such termination).

ARTICLE XII

result from actions by Agent, or failures by Agent to act (provided that
indemnification with respect to any Claim arising as a result of Agent's acts or

due to fraud, willful misconduct, misapplication of funds, illegal acts or
bankruptcy shall be paid solely through Payments in accordance with Article V

harmless and defend each Indemnified Person on an After Tax Basis from and

resources or the environment arising in connection with the
generation, use, handling, treatment, storage, transport or disposal
of any Hazardous Substance, and irrespective of whether any of such
activities were or will be undertaken in accordance with Applicable
Laws;

provided, however, that in the case of clauses (b) - (e), inclusive, to the
extent any event or condition described therein is related to the construction
of the Facility, Agent shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Person in
respect thereof only to the extent such event or condition resulted from the
acts of Agent or failure by Agent to act.

12.3 Agent's General Tax Indemnity.

(a) Payments Free and Clear. All payments made to or for
the benefit of the Owner Trust under the Operative Agreements (including
payments of any Financing Cost, Owner Trust Yield fees and the purchase price
payable on the exercise of the Purchase Option) shall be made free and clear of

sales, use or documentary Taxes, excise Taxes or any other property, transfer,
transfer gains or recording, publication or filing Taxes, or any other Taxes in
the nature of the foregoing imposed by any Governmental Authority, which arise
directly or indirectly from (i) the acquisition, ownership, operation,
occupancy, possession, use, non-use, mortgaging, financing, leasing, subleasing,
or disposition

Owner Trustee or the Owner Trust; (ii) any payment made under the Operative
Agreements; (iii) the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with
respect to the Operative Agreements; (iv) the conveyance or transfer of the
Owner Trust, the Owner Trust Parent, the Trust Estate, the Property or any part
thereof (or any portion thereof) in compliance with any requirement of the

Taxes result from actions by Agent or failures by Agent to act (but excluding

by Agent to act which are related to Completion), Agent shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless all Indemnified Persons from and against the full amount of
all Impositions and Other Taxes (including, current or future stamp, intangible,
document or other Taxes that arise from the execution, delivery, recording, or
registration of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby) on an
After Tax Basis except those arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Person incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Construction Contracts, and any
other Operative Agreement (but without duplication for any amount payable
elsewhere under this Agreement or under any other Operative Agreement to the
extent actually paid) required to be paid by such Indemnified Person on its
behalf or on behalf of any other Person, and any liability (including penalties,
interest and expenses, except those arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Person; provided, that, solely for purposes of
this parenthetical, gross negligence or willful misconduct shall include the
failure by such Indemnified Person to provide written notice to Agent of any
written notice from any Governmental Authority received by such Indemnified
Person for any Impositions or Other Taxes as to which the Agent may have an
indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 12.3 within 90 days after such
Indemnified Person shall have Actual Knowledge of such written notice, but only
to the extent the Agent shall have actually been prejudiced as a result of such
failure), arising therefrom or with respect thereto (including from any
obligation to file any Tax return, report or statement with respect to any such
Impositions or Other Taxes and any liability the Indemnified Person may incur or
be required to pay pursuant to Section 13.3), whether or not such Impositions or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.

(d) Impositions shall mean any and all liabilities,
losses, expenses and costs of any kind whatsoever for fees, taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, impositions, assessments or withholdings of any kind
or nature whatsoever, general and special, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen
and unforeseen, of every character imposed or assessed by a Governmental
Authority and any penalties, interest, and additions to tax (including inflation
adjustments imposed thereon that are similar to interest or penalties) of any
kind therewith ("Taxes"), excluding (except for Taxes that apply as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not being treated
as a loan for Tax purposes by any Governmental Authority, but only to the extent
the amount of such Taxes exceed the amount of

Lessor Indemnified Person's (other than Owner Trust's or Owner Trust Parent's)
overall net income, net receipts, capital, or net worth (A) by the jurisdiction

the Indemnified Person or Lessor Indemnified Person as a result of acts by such
Person (or an Affiliate of such Person) that is expressly prohibited by this
Agreement or by another Operative Agreement, except to the extent such breach is
caused by Agent's actions (or failure to act); (vii) Taxes arising out of, or
caused by, any voluntary assignment, sale, transfer, or other voluntary transfer
or disposition of the Property, Facility, or any interest therein (it being
understood that any transfer or disposition as a result of the exercise of the

foregoing exclusion shall not apply to any transfer that results from a
bankruptcy of Owner Trust or Owner Trust Parent or a foreclosure against Owner
Trust or Owner Trust Parent if the bankruptcy or foreclosure would not have
occurred if Agent and its Affiliates had performed all obligations under this
Agreement or any other Operative Agreement or if the bankruptcy or foreclosure
would not have occurred if all of Agent's representations or warranties in all
Operative Agreements were accurate in all respects or if such bankruptcy of
Owner Trust or Owner Trust Parent or foreclosure against Owner Trust or Owner
Trust Parent occurred while an Agent Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing; (viii) Taxes arising in connection with an Owner Trust Lien; (ix)
Taxes imposed on any assignee or successor in interest to an Indemnified Person
or Lessor Indemnified Person (including any successor or assignee by way of
merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganization, or otherwise by operation of
law) to the extent any such Taxes exceed the Taxes that would have been imposed
had no assignment or transfer taken place determined under the law in effect on
the date of transfer, except if Agent or one of its Affiliates requests such
transfer or the transfer is required pursuant to the terms of an Operative
Agreement or the transfer occurs while an Agent Event of Default shall have
occurred and is continuing; (x) Taxes imposed on, based on, or measured by any
compensation the applicable Trustee receives for its services; (xi) Taxes
imposed on any Indemnified Person or Lessor Indemnified Person resulting from

(A) was required by Applicable Law or an Operative Agreement, (B) may be
necessary or appropriate to, or is in conformity with, any amendment,
modification, supplement, or written waiver requested by, or consented to, by
Agent or one of its Affiliates, or (C) is made while an Agent Event of Default

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (xiv) Taxes imposed
attributable to any period after the expiration or early termination of this
Agreement, or if later, where required by this Agreement, surrender to Owner
Trust or its successor of the Facility in compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement. It being expressly agreed that any Tax constituting an Imposition
(whether income, franchise, or otherwise) imposed on Owner Trust or Owner Trust
Parent as a result of any of the transactions or payments contemplated by the
Operative Agreements to which Agent is a party is subject to indemnification
under Section 12.3(c) or 13.3(c) as applicable.

(e) Payments. Each payment required to be made by the
Agent pursuant to this Section 12.3 shall be paid either (i) when due directly
to the applicable taxing authority by the Agent if it is permitted to do so, or
(ii) where direct payment is not permitted and with respect to gross up amounts,
in immediately available funds to such Indemnified Person by the later of (A) 30
days following the Agent's receipt of the Indemnified Person's written



83

demand for the payment (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement of the
Indemnified Person describing in reasonable detail the Taxes for which the
Indemnified Person is demanding indemnity and the computation of such Taxes) and
certifying that such costs are being charged to other similarly situated
borrowers under similar financing arrangements or (B) subject to paragraph (k)
below, in the case of amounts which are being contested pursuant to such
paragraph (k), at the time and in accordance with a final determination of such
contest, provided, however, that with respect to a payment pursuant to Section
12.3(k)(ii)(D), in no event later than the date which is three Business Days
prior to the date on which such Taxes are required to be paid to the applicable
taxing authority. An Indemnified Person shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver any such demand within thirty (30) days after such Indemnified Person
has Actual Knowledge that such payment is required; provided, that failure to
deliver such demand within thirty (30) days shall not alter such Indemnified
Person's rights under this Section 12.3.

(f) Prescribed Forms. Each Certificate Participant shall
deliver to Agent, on or before the Closing Date, copies of all Prescribed Forms.
Thereafter and from time to time, each Certificate Participant shall submit to
Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of the Prescribed Forms
(or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant
United States taxing authorities) as may be (i) requested by Agent, and (ii)
required under then-current United States law or regulations to avoid United
States withholding taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be received by
such Certificate Participant or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or the
other Operative Agreements, including fees. If any Certificate Participant
determines, as a result of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty,
or in any official application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to
submit to Agent any form or certificate that such Certificate Participant is
obligated to submit pursuant to this Section 12.3, or that such Certificate
Participant is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate
previously submitted, such Certificate Participant shall promptly notify Agent
of such fact.

(g) Reports. If any report, return, or statement is
required to be filed with respect to Taxes that are subject to indemnification
under Section 12.3 or 12.4, Agent shall, if permitted by Applicable Law, timely
prepare and file such report, return, or statement; provided, however, if Agent
is not permitted by Applicable Law to file such return, Agent shall promptly
notify the appropriate Person, in which case the Person, at Agent's expense,
will file any return after Agent properly prepares such return.

(h) Restructuring. If Agent is liable (or appears, in
Agent's reasonable belief, that it will be liable) for any Imposition under
Section 12.3 or 12.4 hereof or 13.3 or 13.4 hereof, Owner Trust, Owner Trust
Parent and the Certificate Participants agree to cooperate with Agent to take
all reasonable actions which are necessary or appropriate to restructure the
transactions contemplated hereby in any reasonable manner requested by Agent to
avoid or minimize Agent's indemnification obligations hereunder; provided,
however, Owner Trust, Owner Trust Parent and the Certificate Participants shall
not be required to take any action that results in any Tax, cost or other
expense to such Person (or any of its Affiliates) or which, in



84

Construction Agency Agreement


such Person's reasonable belief, would have an adverse effect on such Person's
(or any of its Affiliate's) rights under this Agreement or another Operative
Agreement or to its business or, in such Person's reasonable belief, would cause
such Person (or one of its Affiliates) to violate any Applicable Law.

(i) Receipt. Within thirty (30) days after the date of
any deduction of any Impositions, the Applicable Payor shall furnish to the
Applicable Payee, Lender Agent, the Owner Trust and the Trustee thereof the
original or a certified copy of a receipt or other documentation evidencing
payment thereof.

(j) Determinations. The determination of all Impositions
to be paid or indemnified against by the Agent under this Section 12.3 on an
After Tax Basis shall be made (in good faith) by the affected Applicable Payee.
Such determination shall state with reasonable clarity and detail the basis for
such determination, shall certify that such costs are being charged to other
similarly situated borrowers under similar financing arrangements and shall,
absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on the Agent. In no
event shall the Agent in connection with this Section 12.3 or for any other
purpose whatsoever under any Operative Agreement have any right to examine any
Tax return or related books and records of any Applicable Payee.

(k) Contests. (i) If any written claim shall be made
against any Indemnified Person or if any proceeding shall be commenced against
any Indemnified Person (including a written notice of such proceeding)
(collectively a "Tax Claim") for any Tax as to which the Agent may have an
indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 12.3, such Indemnified Person
shall as soon as practicable after its receipt or commencement, and in any event
within thirty (30) days notify the Agent in writing and furnish the Agent with
copies of such Tax Claim and all other writings received from the taxing
authority to the extent relating to such Tax Claim (provided, that failure to so
notify the Agent within thirty (30) days shall not alter such Indemnified
Person's rights under this Section 12.3 except to the extent such failure
precludes or materially adversely affects the ability to conduct a contest of
any Tax Claim) and shall not take any action with respect to such Tax Claim
without the written consent of the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or unreasonably delayed) for thirty (30) days after the receipt of such
notice by the Agent; provided, however, that in the case of any such Tax Claim,
if such Indemnified Person shall be required by law or regulation to take action
prior to the end of such 30-day period, such Indemnified Person shall in such
notice to the Agent, so inform the Agent, and such Indemnified Person shall not
take any action with respect to such Tax Claim without the consent of the Agent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed) for ten
(10) days after the receipt of such notice by the Agent unless the Indemnified
Person shall be required by law or regulation to take action prior to the end of
such 10-day period.

(ii) The Agent shall be entitled for a period of thirty
(30) days from receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Person (or such
shorter period reasonably specified

by the Indemnified Person as the Indemnified Person has notified the Agent is
required by law or regulation for such Indemnified Person to commence such
contest of such Tax Claim), to request in writing that such Indemnified Person
contest the imposition of such Tax, at the Agent's sole cost and expense and the
Indemnified Person shall not pay such Tax Claim during such period. If (x) such
Tax Claim can be pursued in the name of the Agent and independently from any
other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Indemnified Person for which
the Agent has not agreed to indemnify such Indemnified Person, (y) such Tax
Claim must be pursued in the name of the Indemnified Person, but can be pursued
independently from any other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such
Indemnified Person for which the Agent has not agreed to indemnify such
Indemnified Person or (z) the Indemnified Person so requests, then the Agent
shall be permitted to control the contest of such Tax Claim; provided, that in
the case of a Tax Claim described in clause (y), if the Indemnified Person
reasonably determines that the contest of such Tax Claim by the Agent could have
an adverse impact on the business or operations of the Indemnified Person, such
Indemnified Person may elect to control or reassert control of the Tax Claim,
and provided, that by taking control of the Tax Claim, Agent acknowledges that
it is responsible for the Tax ultimately determined to be due by reason of such
claim. In all other claims requested to be contested by the Agent, such
Indemnified Person shall control the contest of such Tax Claim. In no event
shall the Agent be permitted to contest (or the Indemnified Person be required
to contest) any Tax Claim (A) if such Indemnified Person provides the Agent with
a legal opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Agent that such action,
suit or proceeding involves a risk of imposition of criminal liability or could
involve a material risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of
any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any Property or any part of any
thereof unless the Agent shall have posted and maintained a bond or other
security satisfactory to the relevant Indemnified Person in respect to such
risk, (B) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing unless the Agent
shall have posted and maintained by a bond or other security satisfactory to the
relevant Indemnified Person in respect of the Taxes subject to such Tax Claim
and any and all expenses for which the Agent is responsible hereunder reasonably
foreseeable in connection with the contest of such Tax Claim, (C) unless the
Agent shall have agreed to pay and shall pay, to such Indemnified Person on
demand all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, losses and expenses that such
Indemnified Person may incur in connection with contesting such Tax Claim
including all reasonable legal, accounting and investigatory fees and
disbursements, or (D) if such contest shall involve the payment of the Tax prior
to the contest, unless the Agent shall provide to the Indemnified Person an
interest-free advance in an amount equal to the Tax that the Indemnified Person
is required to pay (with no additional net after-tax costs to such Indemnified
Person) (a "Tax Advance"). In addition for Indemnified Person controlled Tax
Claims and Tax Claims contested in the name of such Indemnified Person in a
public forum, no contest shall be required (A) unless the amount of the
potential indemnity (taking into account all similar or logically related Tax
Claims that have been or could be raised in any audit involving such Indemnified
Person with respect to any period for which the Agent may be liable to pay an
indemnity under this Section 12.3) exceeds $50,000 and (B) unless, if requested
by such Indemnified Person, the Agent shall have provided to such Indemnified

Construction Agency Agreement


Person an opinion of independent tax counsel selected by such Indemnified Person
and reasonably acceptable to the Agent that a reasonable basis exists to contest
such Tax Claim. In no event shall an Indemnified Person be required to appeal an
adverse judicial determination to the United States Supreme Court.

(iii) The party conducting the Tax Claim shall consult
in good faith with the other party and its counsel with respect to the contest
of such Tax Claim for Taxes (or claim for refund) but the decisions regarding
what actions are to be taken shall be made by the controlling party in its sole
judgment; provided, however, that if the Indemnified Person is the controlling
party and the Agent recommends the acceptance of a settlement offer made by the
relevant Governmental Authority and such Indemnified Person rejects such
settlement offer, then the amount for which the Agent will be required to
indemnify such Indemnified Person with respect to the Taxes subject to such
offer shall not exceed the amount which it would have owed if such settlement
offer had been accepted. In addition, the controlling party shall keep the
noncontrolling party and its designated counsel reasonably informed as to the
progress of the Tax Claim, and shall provide the noncontrolling party and its
designated counsel with a copy of (or appropriate excerpts from) any reports or
claims issued by the relevant auditing agents or taxing authority to the
controlling party thereof, in connection with such Tax Claim or the contest
thereof.

(iv) Each Indemnified Person shall, at the Agent's sole
cost and expense, supply the Agent with such information and documents
reasonably requested by the Agent as are necessary or advisable for the Agent to
participate in any action, suit or proceeding to the extent permitted by this
Section 12.3(k); provided, however, that such Indemnified Person shall not be
required to provide to the Agent copies of its tax returns or any other
information, documentation or materials that it deems to be confidential or
proprietary. No Indemnified Person shall enter into any settlement or other
compromise or fail to appeal an adverse ruling with respect to any Tax Claim
which is entitled to be indemnified under this Section 12.3 (and with respect to
which a contest is required under this Section 12.3) without the prior written
consent of the Agent, unless such Indemnified Person waives its right to be
indemnified under this Section 12.3 with respect to such Tax Claim.

(v) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, an Indemnified Person will not be required to contest (and the Agent
shall not be permitted to contest) a Tax Claim with respect to the imposition of
any Tax if such Indemnified Person shall waive its right to indemnification
under this Section 12.3 with respect to such Tax Claim (and any Tax Claim with
respect to such year or any other taxable year the contest of which is
materially adversely affected as a result of such waiver) and shall promptly
repay to the Agent any Tax Advance paid to such Indemnified Person in respect of
such Taxes.

(l) Refunds. To the extent that any Indemnified Person
has actually and finally received a refund of any Impositions or Other Taxes
(including interest) that can be clearly identified as specifically relating to
Impositions or Other Taxes paid or reimbursed by the Agent pursuant to this
Section 12.3 and that, after taking into account the amount of such refund,



87
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


would result in the total payments under this Section 12.3 exceeding the amount
due to such Indemnified Person from Agent under Section 12.3, such Indemnified
Person shall pay to the Agent, with reasonable promptness following the date on
which it actually receives such refund, an amount equal to the lesser of the
amount of such refund or the amount of such excess, in each case net of all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in
securing such refund.

12.4 Agent's Special Tax Indemnity. To the extent any Tax
results from actions by Agent, or failures by Agent to act (provided that
indemnification hereunder with respect to any Tax arising as a result of Agent's
acts or failures by Agent to act which are related to Completion shall be paid
solely through payments in accordance with Article V hereof), Agent shall pay
and assume all liability for and does hereby agree to, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless any Indemnified Person on an After Tax Basis (but without
duplication for any amount payable elsewhere under this Agreement or under any
other Operative Agreement to the extent actually paid) from and against (a) any
Tax or other cost resulting from the breach, inaccuracy or incorrectness of the
representation found in Section 7.1(o), (b) any Taxes that have to be paid by
Owner Trust under Section 4.1(b) of the Credit Agreement; and (c) any Taxes that
would have to be indemnified by Owner Trust under Article XIII hereof. Any Taxes
subject to indemnification hereunder shall be reimbursed in accordance with the
provisions of Section 12.3(e).

12.5 Additional Costs. Agent agrees to pay any Additional
Costs that are due and payable pursuant to the Credit Agreement and the Master
Trust Agreement; provided, that except to the extent that such additional costs
arise by reason of Agent's act or failure to act unrelated to Completion,
Agent's obligations hereunder shall be satisfied solely from the proceeds of
Payments.

12.6 Agent's Indemnity Exclusions. Any Claim, to the extent
resulting from or arising out of or attributable to any of the following, is
excluded from Agent's agreement to indemnify any Indemnified Person under this
Article XII other than Sections 12.3 and 12.4:

(a) acts, omissions or events occurring after the
expiration or early termination of this Agreement and, if later,
where required by this Agreement; surrender to Owner Trust or its
successor of the Facility in compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement;

(b) with respect to the relevant Indemnified Person, any
offer, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition (voluntary or
involuntary) by or on behalf of (A) Owner Trust Parent of its
interest in Owner Trust, or (B) Owner Trust of all or any of its
interest in the Facility, (C) the Lenders of any of their interests
in the Loans, or (D) the Certificate Participants of any of their
beneficial interest of Owner Trust Parent, unless such offer, sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition is required by or
otherwise made in compliance with the terms of the Operative
Agreements or occurs in connection with the exercise of remedies
during an Agent Event of Default;



88
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


(c) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an
Indemnified Person seeking indemnification;

(d) the noncompliance with the terms of the Operative
Agreements by, or the breach of any agreement, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in any Operative Agreement to
which it is a party of, the Indemnified Person seeking
indemnification to the extent such noncompliance or breach has been
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction;

(e) any obligation or liability expressly borne, assumed
or to be paid in any Operative Agreement by the Indemnified Person
seeking indemnification; provided, however, that such exclusion
shall not apply to any indemnity obligations of Lessor expressly
undertaken under the Operative Agreements;

(f) with respect to the Indemnified Person seeking
indemnification, any claim constituting or arising from an Owner
Trust's Lien attributable to such Indemnified Person (other than
these Liens arising or created as a result of action undertaken or
documents or instruments executed by Owner Trust pursuant to the
request of Agent or in connection with an Agent Event of Default or
a Guarantor Event of Default); provided, however, that this
exception shall not apply with respect to Owner Trust obligations
under Article XIII of this Agreement;

(g) any amendment other than an amendment to which Agent
or Guarantor is a party or has been expressly requested by Agent or
Guarantor in writing or which occurs in connection with any Agent
Event of Default or Owner Trust Termination Event;

(h) any Claim that constitutes principal or interest on
the Loans or Owner Trust Yield as opposed to amounts payable by
Agent which are calculated based thereon;

(i) any Claim resulting from any event of default not
caused by an Agent Event of Default; and

(j) any misdirection or misapplication of funds by any
Secured Party.

12.7 Agent's Indemnification Procedure under Sections 12.1 and
12.2. Each Indemnified Person under Section 12.1 or 12.2 shall promptly after
such Indemnified Person shall have actual knowledge thereof notify Agent in
writing of any Claim as to which indemnification is sought; provided, that the
failure so to notify Agent shall not reduce or affect Agent's liability which it
may have to such Indemnified Person under Section 12.1 or 12.2. Any amount
payable to any Indemnified Person pursuant to Section 12.1 or 12.2 shall be paid
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such written demand therefor from
such Indemnified



89
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


Person, accompanied by a certificate of such Indemnified Person setting forth
the calculations in reasonable detail constituting the basis for the
indemnification thereby sought and (if such Indemnified Person is not a party
hereto) an agreement to be bound by the terms hereof as if such Indemnified
Person were such a party. Promptly after Agent receives notification of such
Claim accompanied by such certificate, Agent shall notify such Indemnified
Person whether it intends to pay, object to, compromise or defend any matter
involving the asserted liability of such Indemnified Person. Agent shall have
the right to investigate and so long as no Agent Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, Agent shall have the right in its sole discretion to
defend or compromise any Claim for which indemnification is sought under Section
12.1 or 12.2, provided, further, that no Claim shall be compromised by Agent if
there is (i) an admission of guilt, complicity or culpability or any criminal
violation or gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such
Indemnified Person or (ii) an incurrence of any payment obligation or other
civil or criminal liability on the part of any Indemnified Person (unless with
respect to a payment obligation it is paid by Agent) without the express written
consent of such Indemnified Person. If Agent elects, subject to the foregoing,
to compromise or defend any such asserted liability, it may do so at its own
expense and by counsel selected by it and reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Person. Upon Agent's election to compromise or defend such asserted
liability and prompt notification to such Indemnified Person or its intent to do
so, such Indemnified Person shall cooperate at Agent's expense with all
reasonable requests of Agent in connection therewith to minimize the amount of
such Claim and the cost and expense to Agent of such compromise or defense
(provided that such Indemnified Person shall not suffer any material economic,
legal or regulatory disadvantage as a result of such cooperation) and will
provide Agent with all information not within the control of Agent as is
reasonably available to such Indemnified Person which Agent may reasonably
request; provided, however, that such Indemnified Person shall not, unless
otherwise agreed or required by Applicable Law, be obligated to disclose to
Agent or any other Person, or permit Agent or any other Person to examine (a)
any tax returns or related books and records of the Certificate Participants or
Owner Trust, or (b) any confidential information or pricing information not
generally accessible by the public possessed by Certificate Participants or
Owner Trust (and, in the event that any such information is made available,
Agent shall treat such information as confidential and shall take all actions
reasonably requested by such Indemnified Person for purposes of obtaining a
stipulation from all parties to the related proceeding providing for the
confidential treatment of such information from all such parties). Where Agent,
or the insurers under a policy of insurance maintained by Agent, undertake the
defense of such Indemnified Person with respect to a Claim (with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person and without reservation of
rights against such Indemnified Person), no additional legal fees or expenses of
such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Claim shall be
indemnified hereunder unless such fees or expenses were incurred at the request
of the Agent or such insurers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified
Person may participate at its own expense in any judicial proceeding controlled
by Agent pursuant to the preceding provisions, but only to the extent that such
party's participation does not in the reasonable opinion of counsel to Agent
interfere with such control; provided, however, that such party's participation
does not

constitute a waiver of the indemnification provided in Section 12.1 or 12.2;
provided, further, that if and to the extent that such Indemnified Person is
advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict of interest exists where
it is advisable for such Indemnified Person to retain separate counsel or such
Indemnified Person may be indicted or otherwise charged in a criminal complaint
and such Indemnified Person informs Agent that such Indemnified Person desires
to be represented by separate counsel, such Indemnified Person shall have the
right to control its own defense of such Claim and the reasonable fees and
expenses of such defense (including the reasonable fees and expenses of such
separate counsel) shall be borne by Agent. So long as no Agent Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, no Indemnified Person shall enter into
any settlement or other compromise with respect to any Claim without the prior
written consent of Agent unless (x) the Indemnified Person waives its rights to
indemnification hereunder or (y) Agent has not acknowledged its indemnity
obligation with respect thereto and there is a significant risk that a default
judgment will be entered against such Indemnified Person. Nothing contained in
this Section 12.7 shall be deemed to require an Indemnified Person to Contest
any Claim or to assume responsibility for or control of any judicial proceeding
with respect thereto.

12.8 Agent's Subrogation. To the extent that a Claim
indemnified by Agent under this Article XII is in fact paid in full by Agent or
an insurer under an insurance policy maintained by Agent, Agent (so long as no
Agent Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) or such insurer
shall be subrogated to the rights and remedies of the Indemnified Person on
whose behalf such Claim was paid to the extent of such payment (other than
rights of such Indemnified Person under insurance policies maintained at its own
expense) with respect to the transaction or event giving rise to such Claim.
Should an Indemnified Person receive any refund, in whole or in part, with
respect to any Claim paid by Agent under Section 12.1 or 12.2 hereof, it shall
promptly pay over to Agent the lesser of (i) the amount refunded reduced by the
amount of any Tax incurred by reason of the receipt or accrual of such refund
and increased by the amount of any Tax (but not in excess of the amount of such
reduction) saved as a result of such payment or (ii) the amount Agent or any of
their insurers has paid in respect of such Claim.

12.9 Agent's Survival of Agent's Indemnification Obligations.
It is expressly understood and agreed that the indemnification obligations of
Agent provided for in this Article XII shall survive the expiration or
termination of, and shall be separate and independent from any remedy under,
this Agreement or any direct or indirect acquisition of the Property or the
Facility by Agent or a Designee; provided, that except in the case of a
termination as a result of the exercise of the Remarketing Requirement or the
Lease Option, such indemnification obligation shall no longer be subject to the

Construction Agency Agreement


Operative Agreement to or for the benefit of a Lender, Lender Agent, Certificate
Participant, the applicable Trustee, Owner Trust Parent, the Master Owner
Trustee or the Owner Trust or the other Lessor Indemnified Persons ("Applicable
Payee"), (i) the amounts payable by the Applicable Payor (as rent, interest or
otherwise) shall be increased by the amount necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 13.3) the Applicable Payee shall receive an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
Applicable Payor shall make such deductions and (iii) the Applicable Payor shall
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other
Governmental Authority in accordance with all applicable laws. The Owner Trust
will indemnify each Lessor Indemnified Person on an After Tax Basis for the full

sentence of this Section 13.3(a) and any liability such Lessor Indemnified
Person may incur or be required to pay.

(b) [Intentionally Omitted.]

defend and hold harmless all Lessor Indemnified Persons from and against the
full amount of all Impositions and Other Taxes (including current or future
stamp, intangible, document or other Taxes that arise from the execution,
delivery, recording or registration of this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated hereby) on an After Tax Basis except those arising from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Lessor Indemnified Person incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other
Operative Agreement (but without duplication for any amount payable elsewhere
under this Agreement or under any other Operative Agreement to the extent
actually paid) required to be paid by such Lessor Indemnified Person on its
behalf or on behalf of any other Person, and any liability (including penalties,
interest and expenses, except those arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Lessor Indemnified Person; provided, that solely for purposes
of this parenthetical, gross negligence or willful misconduct shall include the
failure by such Lessor Indemnified Person to provide written notice to the Owner
Trust of any written notice from any Governmental Authority received by such
Lessor Indemnified Person for any Imposition or Other Taxes as to which the
Owner Trust may have an indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 13.3
within ninety (90) days after such Lessor Indemnified Person shall have Actual
Knowledge of such written notice, but only to the extent the Owner Trust shall
have actually been prejudiced as a result of such failure), arising therefrom or
with respect thereto (including from any obligation to file any Tax return,
report or statement with respect to any such Impositions or Other Taxes and any
liability the Lessor Indemnified Person may incur or be required to pay pursuant
to Section 13.3 hereof) whether or not such Impositions or Other Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted.

(d) [Intentionally Omitted.]

Construction Agency Agreement


(e) Payments. Each payment required to be made by the
Owner Trust pursuant to this Section 13.3 shall be paid either (i) when due
directly to the applicable taxing authority by the Owner Trust if it is
permitted to do so, or (ii) where direct payment is not permitted and with
respect to gross up amounts, in immediately available funds to such Lessor
Indemnified Person by the later of (A) 30 days following the Owner Trust's
receipt of the Lessor Indemnified Person's written demand for the payment (which
demand shall be accompanied by a statement of the Lessor Indemnified Person
describing in reasonable detail the Taxes for which the Lessor Indemnified
Person is demanding indemnity and the computation of such Taxes) and certifying
that such costs are being charged to other similarly situated borrowers under
similar financing arrangements or (B) subject to paragraph (k) below, in the
case of amounts which are being contested pursuant to such paragraph (k), at the
time and in accordance with a final determination of such contest, provided,
however, that with respect to a payment pursuant to Section 12.3(ii)(D) (as
incorporated in Section 13.3(k)(ii), in no event later than the date which is
three Business Days prior to the date on which such Taxes are required to be
paid to the applicable taxing authority. A Lessor Indemnified Person shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver any such demand within thirty (30) days after
such Lessor Indemnified Person has Actual Knowledge that such payment is
required; provided, that failure to deliver such demand within thirty (30) days
shall not alter such Lessor Indemnified Person's rights under this Section 13.3.

(f) Prescribed Forms. Each Lessor Indemnified Person
will deliver to the Owner Trust and the Agent on or before the Closing Date,
copies of all Prescribed Forms. Thereafter and from time to time, each such
Lessor Indemnified Person shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to Owner Trust
and the Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of the Prescribed
Forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the
relevant United States taxing authorities) as may be (i) requested by Owner
Trust or the Agent, and (ii) required under then-current United States law or
regulations to avoid United States withholding taxes on payments in respect of
all amounts to be received by such Lessor Indemnified Person pursuant to the
Operative Agreements, including fees. If such Lessor Indemnified Person
determines, as a result of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty,
or in any official application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to
submit to Owner Trust any form or certificate that such Lessor Indemnified
Person is obligated to submit pursuant to this Section 13.3, or that such Lessor
Indemnified Person is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or
certificate previously submitted, such Lessor Indemnified Person shall promptly
notify Owner Trust of such fact.

(g) Reports. If any report, return, or statement is
required to be filed with respect to Taxes that are subject to indemnification
under Section 13.3 or 13.4, Agent shall, if permitted by Applicable Law, timely
prepare and file such report, return, or statement; provided, however, if Agent
is not permitted by Applicable Law to file such return, Agent shall promptly
notify the appropriate Person, in which case the Person, at Agent's expense,
will file any return after Agent properly prepares such return.

Construction Agency Agreement


(h) Restructuring. If Owner Trust is liable (or appears,
in Owner Trust's or Agent's reasonable belief, that Owner Trust will be liable)
for any Imposition under Section 13.3 or 13.4 hereof, the applicable Owner
Trust, Owner Trust Parent and the Lenders agree to cooperate with Owner Trust
and Agent to take all reasonable actions which are necessary or appropriate to
restructure the transactions contemplated hereby in any reasonable manner
requested by Owner Trust and Agent to avoid or minimize Owner Trust's
indemnification obligations hereunder; provided, however, the applicable Owner
Trust, Owner Trust Parent and the Lenders shall not be required to take any
action that results in any Tax, cost or other expense to such Person (or any of
its Affiliates) or which, in such Person's reasonable belief, would have an
adverse effect on such Person's (or any of its Affiliate's) rights under this
Agreement or another Operative Agreement or to its business or, in such Person's
reasonable belief, would cause such Person (or one of its Affiliates) to violate
any Applicable Law.

(i) Receipt. Within thirty (30) days after the date of
any deduction of any Impositions, the Applicable Payor shall furnish to the
Applicable Payee and the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy
of a receipt or other documentation evidencing payment thereof.

(j) Determinations. The determination of all Impositions
to be paid or indemnified against by the Owner Trust under this Section 13.3 on
an After Tax Basis shall be made (in good faith) by the affected Applicable
Payee. Such determination shall state with reasonable clarity and detail the
basis for such determination, shall certify that such costs are being charged to
other similarly situated borrowers under similar financing arrangements and
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on the Owner
Trust. In no event shall the Owner Trust in connection with this Section 13.3 or
for any other purpose whatsoever under any Operative Agreement have any right to
examine any Tax return or related books and records of any Applicable Payee.

(k) Contests.

(i) If any Tax Claim shall be made against any Lessor
Indemnified Person for any Tax as to which the Owner Trust may
have an indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 13.3,
such Lessor Indemnified Person shall as soon as practicable
after its receipt or commencement, and in any event within
thirty (30) days notify the Owner Trust and Agent in writing
and furnish the Owner Trust and Agent with copies of such Tax
Claim and all other writings received from the taxing
authority to the extent relating to such Tax Claim (provided,
that failure to so notify the Owner Trust and Agent within
thirty (30) days shall not alter such Lessor Indemnified
Person's rights under this Section 13.3 except to the extent
such failure precludes or materially adversely affects the
ability to conduct a contest of any Tax Claim) and shall not
take any action with respect to such Tax Claim without the
written consent of the Owner Trust and Agent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed) for
thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice by the Owner
Trust and Agent; provided, however, that in the case of any
such Tax Claim, if such Lessor Indemnified Person shall be
required by law or regulation to take action prior to the end
of such 30-day period, such Lessor Indemnified Person shall in
such notice to the Owner Trust and Agent, so inform the Owner
Trust and Agent, and such Lessor Indemnified Person shall not
take any action with respect to such Tax Claim without the
consent of the Owner Trust and Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or unreasonably

Construction Agency Agreement


delayed) for ten (10) days after the receipt of such notice by
the Owner Trust and Agent unless the Lessor Indemnified Person
shall be required by law or regulation to take action prior to
the end of such 10-day period.

(ii) The Agent shall be entitled for a period of
thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice from the Lessor
Indemnified Person (or such shorter period reasonably
specified by the Lessor Indemnified Person as the Lessor
Indemnified Person has notified the Agent as required by law
or regulation for such Lessor Indemnified Person to commence
such contest of such Tax Claim), to request in writing that
such Lessor Indemnified Person contest the imposition of such
Tax, at the Agent's sole cost and expense and the Lessor
Indemnified Person shall not pay such Tax Claim during such
period. The provisions of Section 12.3(k) shall control the
conduct of any Tax Claim with all references in such Section
to "Indemnified Person" being deemed references to "Lessor
Indemnified Person."

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, a Lessor Indemnified Person will not be required
to contest (and the Agent shall not be permitted to contest) a
Tax Claim with respect to the imposition of any Tax if such
Lessor Indemnified Person shall waive its right to
indemnification under this Section 13.3 with respect to such
Tax Claim (and any Tax Claim with respect to such year or any
other taxable year the contest of which is materially
adversely affected as a result of such waiver and shall
promptly repay to the Agent any Tax Advances paid to such
Lessor Indemnified Person in respect of such Taxes).

(l) Refunds. To the extent that any Lessor Indemnified
Person has actually and finally received a refund of any Impositions or Other
Taxes (including interest) that can be clearly identified as specifically
relating to Impositions or Other Taxes paid or reimbursed by the Owner Trust
pursuant to this Section 13.3 and that, after taking into account the amount of
such refund, would result in the total payments under this Section 13.3
exceeding the amount due to such Lessor Indemnified Person from Owner Trust
under this Section 13.3, such Lessor Indemnified Person shall pay to the Owner
Trust, or Agent, as applicable, with reasonable promptness following the date on
which it actually receives such refund, an amount equal to the lesser of the
amount of such refund or the amount of such excess, in each case net of all



97
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Lessor Indemnified Person in
securing such refund.

13.4 Owner Trust's Special Tax Indemnity. To the extent any
Tax results from actions by Agent, or failures by Agent to act (provided that
indemnification hereunder with respect to any Tax arising as a result of Agent's
acts or failures by Agent to act which are related to Completion shall be paid
solely through payments in accordance with Article V hereof), Owner Trust shall
pay and assume all liability for and does hereby agree to, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless any Lessor Indemnified Person on an After Tax Basis (but without
duplication for any amount payable elsewhere under this Agreement or under any
other Operative Agreement to the extent actually paid) from and against (a) any
Tax or other cost resulting from the breach, inaccuracy or incorrectness of the
representation found in Section 7.1(o) and (b) any Taxes that have to be paid by
Owner Trust under Section 4.1(b) of the Credit Agreement. Any Taxes subject to
indemnification hereunder shall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions
of Section 13.3(e).

13.5 Indemnity Exclusions. Any Claim, to the extent resulting
from or arising out of or attributable to any of the following, is excluded from
each Owner Trust's agreement to indemnify any Lessor Indemnified Person under
this Section 13 other than Sections 13.3 and 13.4:

(a) acts, omissions or events occurring after the
expiration or early termination of this Agreement and, where
required by this Agreement, surrender to the Agents or its successor
of the Facility in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement;

Person, any offer, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition
(voluntary or involuntary) by or on behalf of (i) Owner Trust Parent
or its Affiliates of any of their interest in the applicable Owner
Trust, or (ii) the applicable Owner Trust of all or any of its
interest in the Facility, or (iii) the Lenders of any of their
interests in the Loans, unless such transfer is required by the
terms of the Operative Agreements or occurs in connection with the
exercise of remedies during an Event of Default;

(c) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Lessor Indemnified Person seeking indemnification;

(d) the noncompliance with the terms of the Operative
Agreements by, or the breach of any agreement, covenant,
representation or warranty of, the Lessor Indemnified Person seeking
indemnification;

(e) any obligation or liability expressly borne, assumed
or to be paid in any Operative Agreement by the Lessor Indemnified
Person seeking indemnification;



98
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


(f) with respect to the Lessor Indemnified Person
seeking indemnification, any claim constituting or arising from a
Lien attributable to such Lessor Indemnified Person (other than
these Liens arising or created as a result of action undertaken or
documents or instruments executed by the Owner Trust pursuant to the
request of Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the
Authorized Representative of any other Secured Party);

(g) any amendment other than an amendment to which any
Agent is a party or has been expressly requested by Agent in
writing;

Certificate Participant, Owner Trust Parent or by Owner Trust (but
in the case of Owner Trust, only to the extent such misdirection or
misapplication is attributable to such Certificate Participant or
Owner Trust Parent or their Affiliates).

13.6 Indemnification Procedure under Section 13.1 or 13.2.
Each Lessor Indemnified Person under Section 13.1 or 13.2 shall promptly after
such Lessor Indemnified Person shall have actual knowledge thereof notify the
Owner Trust and Agent in writing of any Claim as to which indemnification is
sought; provided, that the failure so to notify the Owner Trust and Agent shall
not reduce or affect the Owner Trust's liability which it may have to such
Lessor Indemnified Person under Section 13.1, 13.2, 13.3 or 13.4. Any amount
payable to any Lessor Indemnified Person shall be paid within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of such written demand therefor from such Lessor Indemnified
Person, accompanied by a certificate of such Lessor Indemnified Person stating
in reasonable detail the basis for the indemnification thereby sought and (if
such Lessor Indemnified Person is not a party hereto) an agreement to be bound
by the terms hereof as if such Lessor Indemnified Person were such a party.
Promptly after the Owner Trust receives notification of such Claim accompanied
by a written statement describing in reasonable detail the Claims which are the
subject of and basis for such indemnity and the computation of the amount so
payable, the Owner Trust (acting at the direction of Agent) shall notify such
Lessor Indemnified Person whether it intends to pay, object to, compromise or
defend any matter involving the asserted liability of such Lessor Indemnified
Person. The Agent shall have the right to investigate and so long as no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Agent shall have the right in
its sole discretion to defend or compromise any Claim for which indemnification
is sought under Section 13.1 or 13.2, provided, further, that no Claim shall be
compromised by the Agent on a basis that admits any criminal violation or gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Lessor Indemnified Person
without the express written consent of such Lessor Indemnified Person. If the
Agent elects, subject to the foregoing, to compromise or defend any such
asserted liability, the provision of Section 12.7



99
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


shall control with all references therein to "Indemnified Person" being deemed
to be references to "Lessor Indemnified Person."

the Owner Trust under this Article XIII is in fact paid in full by the Owner
Trust, Agent or an insurer under an insurance policy maintained by the Owner

occurred and be continuing, Agent,) or such insurer shall be subrogated to the
rights and remedies of the Lessor Indemnified Person on whose behalf such Claim
was paid to the extent of such payment (other than rights of such Lessor
Indemnified Person under insurance policies maintained at its own expense) with
respect to the transaction or event giving rise to such Claim. Should a Lessor
Indemnified Person receive any refund, in whole or in part, with respect to any
Claim paid by the applicable Owner Trust hereunder, it shall promptly pay over
to the applicable Owner Trust the lesser of (a) the amount refunded reduced by
the amount of any Tax incurred by reason of the receipt or accrual of such
refund and increased by the amount of any Tax (but not in excess of the amount
of such reduction) saved as a result of such payment or (b) the amount the
applicable Owner Trust or any of its insurers has paid in respect of such Claim.

13.8 Survival of Indemnification Obligations. It is expressly
understood and agreed that the indemnification obligations of the Owner Trust
provided for in this Article XIII shall survive the expiration or termination of
and shall be separate and independent from any remedy under this Agreement or
any direct or indirect acquisition of any Property by Agent or a Designee.

provisions of this Article XIII, each of the Lessor Indemnified Persons hereby
acknowledge and agree that with respect to those matters covered in Article XII
hereof Owner Trust's obligations set forth in this Article XIII are intended to
pass through the obligations of the Agent set forth in such Article XII or,
shall be contingent upon receipt of payments from the Agent under such Article
XII and the Owner Trust agrees not to contest the amount of any indemnification
paid by Agent (and received by the applicable Owner Trust) pursuant to court
order, arbitration proceeding or agreement reached among the applicable Lessor
Indemnified Person and Agent with respect thereto and be bound by such court
order, arbitration proceeding or agreement.

ARTICLE XV

MISCELLANEOUS


15.1 Intent. It is the intent of the parties hereto that for
purposes of commercial, real estate, bankruptcy, federal, state and local tax
law and banking regulations, (a) the transactions contemplated hereby are a
financing arrangement between Agent, as borrower, and the Secured Parties, as
lenders; (b) Owner Trust is a security device for the repayment of the amounts
due the Secured Parties; (c) the Property is pledged to secure the payment of
the debt owed the Secured Parties as provided for in the Security Documents (and
for tax purposes, the debt owed Certificate Participants); and (d) the
obligation of Agent to pay the Termination Amount or the Funded Budget Amount
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as payments of interest on and
principal of, respectively, from the Secured Parties. For commercial, real
estate, bankruptcy and banking regulations, it is the intent of the parties
hereto that Agent hereby collaterally conveys, assigns, transfers and sets over
to Owner Trust on behalf of the Secured Parties and grants a security interest
in, all of the right, title and interest of Agent in, to and under the Property
and all proceeds thereof and all of Agent's right, title and interest in, to and
under Agent's estate under this Agreement, all to secure payment and performance
of all obligations of Agent under the Operative Agreements, effective on the
date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
Specifically, but without limiting the generality of this Section 15.1, Owner
Trust and Agent further intend and agree that, for the purpose of securing
Agent's obligations for the repayment of the amounts outstanding from Owner
Trust to Agent, (x) this Agreement shall be deemed to be a security agreement
and financing statement within the meaning of Article 9 of the UCC; and (y) the
conveyance provided for hereby shall be deemed to be a grant by Agent to Owner
Trust of a lien and security interest in all of Agent's present and future
right, title and interest in and to the Property (whether now existing or
hereafter acquired), including all right, title and interest of Agent in all
proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into
cash, investments, securities or other property, whether in the form of cash,
investments, securities or other property to secure the amounts outstanding
hereunder. The parties further intend that Owner Trust and Owner Trust Parent
shall be disregarded for income tax purposes and that Agent shall be treated as
owner of the Property for income tax purposes and shall be entitled to all tax
benefits associated with ownership, including deductions for depreciation. Each
party hereto agrees and covenants that it shall not (unless required to do so
under Applicable Law) file any tax return, statement, or schedule, or take any
other action, inconsistent with such treatment, or take any action that would
cause Owner Trust or Owner Trust Parent to be taxed as an association taxable as
a corporation or to cause Owner Trust to be taxable as a trust that is not a
grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. Solely to the
extent that a court were to construe this Agreement as a Lease under (and as
defined in) Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to
time in the State of New York (the "NY UCC"), to the maximum extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Agent hereby waives any rights to which it may be entitled as a
lessee under

reject acceptance of the relevant goods.

Any such notice shall be effective upon receipt or refusal. From time to time
any party may designate a new address for purposes of notice hereunder by
written notice to each of the other parties hereto in accordance with this
Section. The parties agree and acknowledge that time is of the essence for
purposes of notices under this Agreement.

(a) Agent acknowledges and agrees that any agreement of Owner
Trust to receive certain notices by facsimile (including any Payment
Directions/Borrowing Notices and Quarterly Certificates) from Agent is solely
for the convenience and at the request of Agent. Owner Trust shall be entitled
to reasonably rely on any notices signed by a Responsible Officer of Agent and
Owner Trust shall not have any liability to Agent or other Person on account of
any action taken or not taken by Owner Trust in reliance upon such facsimile
notice. The obligation of Agent to make any payment pursuant to Section 8.2,
10.1, 11.2 or Article XII shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by
any failure by Owner Trust to receive written confirmation of any facsimile
notice or the receipt by Owner Trust of a confirmation which is at variance with
the terms contained in the facsimile notice.

15.3 Assignment; Successors and Assigns. (a) This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Owner Trust and Agent and their
respective permitted successors and assigns.

(b) Subject to Article X, Agent shall not assign any of its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Owner Trust
and Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent; provided, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, Agent shall have the right, from time to time, to assign any or
all of its rights or obligations hereunder to any Designee

Construction Agency Agreement


(in the case of an assignment of the Purchase Option in accordance with Section
10.1(c)) or any Affiliate of Agent, so long as (i) the Guaranty remains in full
force and effect, as confirmed in writing by the Guarantor, and Agent agrees to
provide Owner Trust with at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of
any such assignment and (ii) in the event the assignee is a non-United States
Affiliate of Agent, such assignee agrees in writing that service of process may
be made on such assignee at the address of Guarantor in the same manner as
provided for in the Guaranty; provided, that Agent also delivers to Owner Trust
and Collateral Agent new UCC Financing Statements, legal opinions and such other
documents necessary for the perfection of Liens on the Facility as Owner Trust
may reasonably request.

(c) If as a result of any change in applicable law or
regulation (i) Owner Trust is prohibited from making or maintaining any Payments
or (ii) being party to the Purchase Agreements or owning the assets contemplated
thereby, or (iii) Owner Trust's participation in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement becomes substantially more costly or administratively
burdensome, Owner Trust may, or at the direction of Agent shall, assign to one
or more Owner Trust Eligible Assignees all or a portion of Owner Trust's rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Aggregate Owner Trust's Contribution Commitment and the Payments owing to it);
provided, however, that (A) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not
a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under this Agreement, (B)
except in the case of an assignment of all of Owner Trust's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the Aggregate Owner Trust's
Contribution Commitment being assigned pursuant to each such assignment
(determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment) shall in no event be less than $10,000,000, (C) the parties to each
such assignment shall execute an Assignment and Acceptance and (D) at the time
of execution of the Assignment and Acceptance, such assignee shall deliver to
Agent any necessary Prescribed Forms in accordance with Section 13.3(f). Upon
such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the
rights and obligations of Owner Trust hereunder and (y) Owner Trust shall, to
the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance covering all of Owner Trust's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, Owner Trust shall cease to be a party hereto, except that
the rights of Owner Trust under Article XII shall continue with respect to
events and occurrences before or concurrently with its ceasing to be a party
hereto).

(d) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
Owner Trust and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other as
follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, Owner
Trust makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
connection with any Operative Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or the



106
<PAGE>



Construction Agency Agreement


execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of any Operative Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith; (ii) Owner Trust makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of Agent or the Guarantor or any other Person or the
performance or observance by Agent or the Guarantor or any other Person of any
of its respective obligations under any Operative Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or in connection herewith;
(iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,
together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section 3.01(a)
of the Guaranty and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon Owner Trust and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement, any of the other Operative
Agreements or any other instrument or document; (v) such assignee confirms that
it is an Owner Trust Eligible Assignee; and (vi) such assignee agrees that it
will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it.

(e) Upon the execution of an Assignment and Acceptance by an
Owner Trust Eligible Assignee, Owner Trust shall give prompt written notice
thereof to Agent.

(f) Owner Trust may, in connection with any assignment or
proposed assignment pursuant to this Section 15.3, disclose to the assignee or
proposed assignee any information relating to Agent or any of its Affiliates
furnished to Owner Trust by or on behalf of Agent or any of its Affiliates;
provided, that prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or proposed assignee
shall execute and deliver to Owner Trust and Agent a confidentiality agreement
reasonably satisfactory to Owner Trust and Agent.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, Owner Trust may at any time create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including the Payments owing to it)
in favor of the Secured Parties.

15.4 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK

AND COVENANTS OF THE CERTIFICATE PARTICIPANTS

perform its obligations under, and otherwise comply with, the provisions of the
Operative Agreements to which such Person is a party (the "Trust Agreements").
None of the Secured Parties shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any of the
Trust Agreements or any of the organizational documents of Owner Trust or Owner
Trust Parent, if any such termination, amendment, modification or waiver could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (a) the rights and
obligations of Agent under this Agreement, including the rights of Agent to
obtain or benefit from Payments, distributions or the release of any Liens
pursuant to this Agreement or (b) the intent of the parties as expressed in
Section 15.1.

the consummation of the Purchase Option at the cost and expense of the Agent and
subject to the compliance by Agent in all respects with the terms of Article X.

16.4 Disclosure. The parties to this Agreement agree that,
notwithstanding any contrary implication in any of the documents related to this
transaction to the contrary, disclosure of this structure and the aspects (as
defined and used in Treas. Reg. Section 301.6111-2T(c)(i)) of the transactions
contemplated hereby are not limited in any way. The parties further agree that
the structure and tax aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby are not
protected from disclosure or use in any manner (such as a claim that the tax
aspects or structure are proprietary to any Person).

16.5 Representations and Warranties of Secured Parties. Each of the
Secured Parties other than Bondholders represents and warrants to each of the
other parties hereto as follows:

(a) Due Organization, etc. It is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the power and authority to enter into the Operative
Agreements to which such Person is a party (the "Financier Documents") (assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto),
and perform the obligations under each of the Financier Documents to which such
Person is or will be a party and each other agreement, instrument and document
to be executed and delivered by it in connection with or as contemplated by the
Financier Documents.

(b) Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance of
each Financier Document to which such Person is or will be a party (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto) has
been duly authorized by all necessary action on its part.

(c) Enforceability, etc. Each of the Financier Documents to
which such Person is a party is the legal, valid and binding obligation of such
Person, and has been duly executed and delivered by such Person, and the other
Financier Documents to which such Person will, upon execution and delivery
thereof, constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against
such Person, in accordance with the terms thereof, except as the same may be
limited by insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equitable principles.

(d) ERISA. No part of the funds to be used by any Secured
Party to make its investment pursuant to the Financier Documents, directly or
indirectly, constitutes or is deemed to constitute assets (within the meaning of
ERISA and any applicable rules, regulations and court decisions thereunder) of
any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA).

Construction Agency Agreement


16.6 Confidentiality. Each of Owner Trust and the Secured Parties
agrees to exercise its best efforts to keep and to cause any third party
recipient of the information described in this Section 16.6 to keep any
information delivered or made available by Agent to it (including any
information obtained pursuant to Section 7.4) confidential; provided, that
nothing shall prevent Owner Trust or any Secured Party from disclosing such
information (a) to any other Secured Party for the purpose of administering or
enforcing this Agreement or the other Operative Agreements, (b) pursuant to
subpoena or upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (c) upon the
request or demand of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Owner
Trust or such Secured Party, (d) if such information has been publicly disclosed
other than in connection with a breach of this Section, (e) to the extent
reasonably required in connection with any litigation to which either Owner
Trust, any Secured Party or their respective Affiliates may be a party, (f) to
the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy
hereunder, (g) to Owner Trust's or such Secured Party's, as the case may be,
legal counsel, independent auditors and other professional advisors, (h) to any
actual or proposed permitted assignee of Owner Trust or a Secured Party that has
agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 16.6. Unless
prohibited from doing so by applicable law, in the event that any Secured Party
is legally requested or required to disclose any confidential information
pursuant to clause (b), (c), or (e) of this Section 16.6, such party shall
promptly notify the Agent of such request or requirement prior to disclosure so
that the Agent may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance
with the terms of this Agreement. If, however, in the opinion of counsel for
such party, such party is nonetheless, in the absence of such order or waiver,
compelled to disclose such confidential information or otherwise stand liable
for contempt or suffer possible censure or other penalty or liability, then such
party may disclose such confidential information without liability to the Agent;
provided, however, that such party will use its best efforts to minimize the
disclosure of such information. Subject to the exceptions above to disclosure of
information, each Secured Party agrees that it shall not publish, publicize, or
otherwise make public any information regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the written consent of the Agent, in
its sole discretion. Subject to the exceptions above to disclosure of
information, Owner Trust, each of the Secured Parties and Agent agrees that it
shall not publish, publicize, or otherwise make public any information regarding
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the written
consent of Agent and the Secured Parties.

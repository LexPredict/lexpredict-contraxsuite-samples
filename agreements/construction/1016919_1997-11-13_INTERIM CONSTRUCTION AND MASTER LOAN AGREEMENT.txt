Agreement shall be correspondingly reduced.

Prior to being required to make any Advance hereunder, Lender shall require
proof in the form of such schedules, affidavits, releases, waivers, statements,
invoices, bills and other documents provided herein or as Lender may reasonably

in force

<PAGE>

and effect and are true and correct; and

in connection with the construction of any part of the Improvements.

3.5  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO SUBSEQUENT ADVANCES.

As a condition precedent to each subsequent Advance after the first Advance
disbursed after the closing of the Loan (the "Initial Advance"), and in addition
to all other requirements herein, Borrower must satisfy the following
requirements:

(a)  All conditions precedent to disbursing the Initial Advance
pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 3.4 hereof, and any other prior Advance, shall have
been and continue to be satisfied;

(b)  There shall exist no default or event (a "Potential Default")
which with notice, lapse of time or, both, would constitute a default hereunder
or under any of the Loan Papers;

(c)  The representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall
be true and correct on and as of the date of each such Advance, with the same
effect as if made on that date;

(d)  Borrower shall have submitted to Lender an Application for
Advance with respect to the Advance being requested;

rights or benefits to be created in favor of Lender pursuant to this Agreement.

3.6  FINAL ADVANCE.

<PAGE>

the Improvements, and in any event not until Lender has received such of the
following with respect to the Improvements and the Loan, as Lender may request
from Borrower: (a) a certificate from Lender's inspector and Borrower's
designated architects/engineers, certifying to Lender that the Improvements have
been completed substantially in accordance with the Plans, as approved by

releases or waivers from) all subcontractors, materialmen and other parties who
have supplied labor, materials or services for the construction of the

statutory or constitutional lien against the Mortgaged Properties, have been
paid in full with respect to the Improvements or that Borrower is contesting
payment of any amounts due upon such liens in a commercially appropriate manner
with adequate reserves being held with Borrower.

3.7  NO WAIVER.

No Advance shall constitute a waiver of any condition precedent to the
obligation of Lender to make any further Advance or preclude Lender from
thereafter declaring the failure of Borrower to satisfy such conditions
precedent to be a default hereunder or under any of the Loan Papers (as
hereafter defined).

3.8  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF LENDER.

All conditions precedent to the obligation of Lender to make the Initial
Advance or any other Advance hereunder are imposed hereby solely for the benefit
of Lender, and no other party may require satisfaction of any such condition
precedent or be entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make any Advance
in the absence of strict compliance with such conditions precedent.  Any
requirement or condition of this Agreement may be waived by Lender at its
discretion, in whole or in part, at any time, but no such waiver shall imply or
be deemed a waiver of any subsequent or other

<PAGE>

requirement or condition of this Agreement or any of the Loan Papers.

shall be secured by the Deed of Trust and any other Security Instruments and
shall be immediately due and payable without notice of any kind whatsoever; and
Borrower agrees to pay such sums upon demand (provided that nothing contained

(s)  Execute and deliver to Lender such documents, financing
statements, instruments, assignments, agreements, extensions, renewals and other
writings, and do such other acts as are necessary or desirable, to preserve and

require from time to time; and

ARTICLE EIGHT

RIGHTS AND REMEDIES

8.1  REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may, at its option and
election, do any one or more of the following:

(a)  Without demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind
whatsoever, including, without limitation, notice of dishonor, notice of
intention to accelerate or of acceleration, all of which are hereby waived,
declare the entire unpaid balance of the Loan immediately due and payable.

(b)  Without notice to Borrower, which is hereby waived, take
possession of the Mortgaged Properties, and, at the option of Lender, exercise
any and all remedies allowed by the Note, the Deed of Trust, or any other of the
Loan Papers, including, but not by way of limitation, reduce any claim to
judgment, foreclose or otherwise enforce Lender's liens on all or any part of
the Mortgaged Properties by any available judicial or non-judicial procedure.

(c)  Apply for and obtain, by appropriate judicial action, appointment
of a receiver

<PAGE>

or receivers for all or any part of the Mortgaged Properties, without regard
to the sufficiency of the security, without any showing of insolvency, fraud
or mismanagement on the part of Borrower, to protect or enforce the rights of
Lender.

(d)  Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its
option, to enter upon and take possession of the Mortgaged Properties, or any
part thereof, and, whether or not in possession of the Mortgaged Properties, to
disburse and directly apply the proceeds of any advance hereunder to the
satisfaction of any of Borrower's obligations hereunder, or for such other
purposes or in such other proportions as Lender may, in its reasonable
discretion, deem necessary or advisable.  Any advance by Lender for such
purposes shall be part of the Loan and shall be secured by the Security
Instruments. Lender will notify Borrower in writing of any disbursements made
directly by Lender.  Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to hold, use, disburse
and apply the proceeds of the Loan for payment of expenses incident to the Loan
or the Mortgaged Properties and the payment or performance of the obligations
incident thereto.  Borrower hereby assigns and pledges the proceeds of the Loan
to Lender for such purposes.

8.2  APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.

Lender shall be entitled to apply the proceeds of any sale of all or any
part of the Mortgaged Properties (or its rights thereto) toward payment of the
Loan in such order and manner as Lender, in its reasonable discretion, may deem
advisable.  Lender shall account to Borrower for any surplus remaining after
payment in full of the Loan and reasonable costs and expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with any
such sale.

8.3  PERFORMANCE OF BORROWER'S OBLIGATIONS.

<PAGE>

Should any covenant, duty or agreement of Borrower fail to be performed
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Lender may, at its election,
perform, or attempt to perform, such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of
Borrower.  Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, promptly pay any amount
expended by Lender in such performance or attempted performance to Lender at
its address stated herein, together with interest thereon at the Default
Interest Rate (as such term is defined in the Note) from date of such
expenditure by Lender until paid; provided, that Lender does not assume and
shall never, except by express written consent of Lender, have any liability
for the performance of any duties or obligations of Borrower under or in
connection with all or any part of the Mortgaged Properties or any of the
Loan Papers.

8.4  NO LIABILITY OF LENDER.

Lender shall have no liability, obligation or responsibility whatsoever
with respect to the Mortgaged Properties except to make advances of the
proceeds of the Loan pursuant to this Agreement.  Lender shall not be
obligated to inspect the Mortgaged Properties nor be liable for any action,
performance or default of Borrower, or for the payment of costs of
construction or development of the Mortgaged Properties or labor, materials
or services supplied in connection therewith, or for the performance of any
obligation or indebtedness of Borrower whatsoever, nor shall Lender have any
responsibility or obligation for the management, conduct or operation of the
business affairs of Borrower. Nothing, including without limitation, any
advance hereunder or acceptance of any document or instrument, shall be
construed as a representation or warranty, expressed or implied, to any party
by Lender, and no condition hereof, or of any of the Loan papers, shall be
construed so as to deem the relationship between borrower and Lender to be
other than that of borrower and lender, and Borrower shall at all times
represent that the relationship between Borrower and Lender is solely that of
borrower and lender, and not that of partners, joint venturers, fiduciaries,
guarantors or the like.  BORROWER HEREBY INDEMNIFIES AND AGREES TO HOLD
LENDER SAFE AND HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY COST, EXPENSE, LIEN OR
LIABILITY INCURRED OR SUFFERED BY LENDER AS A RESULT OF ANY ASSERTION OR
CLAIM OF ANY OBLIGATION OR RESPONSIBILITY OF LENDER FOR THE MANAGEMENT,
OPERATION AND CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS AND AFFAIRS OF BORROWER, OR AS A RESULT
OF ANY ASSERTION OR CLAIM OF ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY OF LENDER FOR
THE PAYMENT OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY INDEBTEDNESS OR OBLIGATION OF BORROWER.

<PAGE>

8.5  RIGHT OF OFFSET.

Borrower hereby grants to Lender a right of offset, to secure repayment
of the Loan, upon any and all monies, securities or other property of
Borrower, and the proceeds therefrom, now or hereafter held or received by or
in transit to Lender, from or for the account of Borrower (except for any
monies, securities, or other property, which come into the possession,
custody, or control of Lender in his capacity as Vice President of CCAR and
not in his capacity as Lender under this Agreement), whether for safekeeping,
custody, pledge, transmission, collection or otherwise, and also upon any and
all deposits (general or special) and credits of Borrower, and any and all
claims of Borrower against Lender at any time existing.  Upon the occurrence
of any default, Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, without notice to Borrower, to offset, appropriate, apply and enforce
said liens against any and all items herein above referred to against the
Loan.

8.6  WAIVERS.

The acceptance by Lender at any time and from time to time of partial
payment on the Loan shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any Event of
Default then existing.  No waiver by Lender of any default shall be deemed to
be a waiver of any other then existing or subsequent default, nor shall any
such waiver by Lender be deemed to be a continuing waiver.  No delay or
omission by Lender in exercising any right, power, privilege or remedy under
the Loan Papers (collectively, "Rights") shall impair any such Rights or be
construed as a waiver thereof or any acquiescence therein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any Rights preclude other or further exercise
thereof, or the exercise of any other Rights.

8.7  CUMULATIVE RIGHTS.

All Rights shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights,
powers, privileges, and remedies granted to Lender at law or in equity, or
otherwise, and may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be
deemed expedient by Lender, whether or not the Loan be due and payable and
whether or not Lender shall have taken other action in connection with this
Agreement or any other of the Loan Papers.

<PAGE>

8.8  TRANSFER OF THE MORTGAGED PROPERTIES.

If Borrower shall sell, convey, lease, assign, transfer, exchange or
dispose of all or any part of the Mortgaged Properties or any interest
therein (a "Transfer") without the prior written consent of Lender (which
consent may be withheld without cause), Lender may, at Lender's option,
declare the Loan immediately due and payable, which option may be exercised
at any time following any such Transfer.  Lender may in its sole discretion
consent to a Transfer, or, upon any transfer made without Lender's prior
written consent, and at Borrower's request, decide not to exercise such
option, in which event Lender's consent or forbearance, as the case may be,
may be predicated on such terms and conditions as Lender may in its sole
discretion require, including but not limited to Lender's approval of the
transferee's credit-worthiness and management ability, and the execution and
delivery to Lender by such transferee, prior to the Transfer, of a written
assumption agreement containing such terms as Lender may require, including
but not limited to a payment of a part of the remaining principal amount of
the Loan, an increase in the rate of interest payable on the Note, the
payment of an assumption fee not to exceed the maximum limit fixed or allowed
by law, a modification of the term of the Note, and such other terms as
Lender may require.  Should a Transfer of all or any part of the Mortgaged
Properties occur without the prior written consent of Lender and payment of
any portion of the Note is thereafter accepted by Lender, such acceptance
shall not be deemed a waiver of the requirement of Lender's consent in
writing thereto or with respect to any other Transfer.

8.9  LIABILITY OF BORROWER.

Notwithstanding any Transfers, it is understood and agreed that Borrower
shall at all times remain liable for payment of the Loan.

8.10 SATISFACTION AND RELEASE.

<PAGE>

Upon full and final payment of the Loan and any and all other debt
secured by the Security Instruments, Lender shall, at the sole cost and
expense of Borrower, release any collateral held by Lender as security for
the Loan.

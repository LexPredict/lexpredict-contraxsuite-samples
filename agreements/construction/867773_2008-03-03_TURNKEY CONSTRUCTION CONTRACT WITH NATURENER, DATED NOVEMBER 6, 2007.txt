commencement of construction for the Solar Park, except those that are
intrinsic to the construction itself and that are the responsibility of
the Contractor in accordance with the terms of Clause 6.6 (having
delivered to the Contractor a copy of those that are the responsibility of
the Owner). For purposes of clarification, the Owner has obtained the
municipal licenses for the work and related activities (to the extent
necessary), as well as the administrative authorization, the approval of
the Electrical Infrastructures Plan and the interconnection point of the
Solar Facilities and has delivered to the Contractor a confirmation issued

permits and authorizations described in subsection (i) above within four (4)
Business Days from the execution of this Contract.  Within five (5)
Business Days from the date of receipt, the Contractor must declare its
acceptance thereof or, if applicable, any changes to the Scope of Work and/or
the Contract Price required as a result of conditions imposed in such
authorizations and licenses. Such changes must be agreed to by the Parties by
executing an appropriate Change Order.  However, the Contractor agrees
that it shall not proceed with any change that imposes conditions more onerous
than those imposed by the permits and authorizations relating to the two
contracts executed on the date hereof among the Contractor, Moralas Renovables,
S.L. and Aluradiel Solar, S.L.






(3)


In
the event that (a)
the letter relating the financing described in subsection (1) has not been
delivered by November 23, 2007, (b) the Condition
Satisfaction Date has not occurred by the tenth Business Day following the
date the Owner delivered such letter to the Contractor, or (c) the Contractor has
not received documentary evidence of the receipt of the permits and
authorizations referred to in subsection (2)(i) above (or an agreement has
not have been reached with respect to the changes required by the
conditions imposed in such licenses and authorizations) prior to November
23, 2007, the Contractor and the Owner may terminate the Contract by
delivery to the other Party of a notice setting forth its desire to
terminate the Contract, and the Parties shall be released from all
obligations assumed with respect thereto.  The foregoing shall
be without prejudice to the purchase orders or requests that the Parties,
or companies belonging to their groups, shall have already made or agreed
to, as of or following the execution of this Contract. Such purchase
orders or requests shall continue in force and effect in accordance with
their terms unless the Owner elects to cancel them, in which case the
Owner shall pay the Contractor any cancellation costs that the Contractor
or any company in its group must pay to any distributor or manufacturer
with respect to such orders.

Contractor’s failure to deliver the Performance Bond and the Corporate
Guarantee.











(4)


The
Contractor represents that, prior to the execution of this Contract, it
has studied the subterrain, surroundings and access
thereto.









The
Contractor represents that the Site is adequate and sufficient for the
performance of the Work, and that the Contractor is aware of and accepts all the
risks and contingencies of the Site that may affect the performance of the Work,
including, without limitation, climate conditions (including wind, snow, frost,
rain, etc.), hydrographic, hydrological, geotechnical and seismic conditions,
any toxic waste or archeological sites that may appear at the Site and in
general any other physical, natural or artificial circumstances of the Site and
the subsoil thereof. Consequently, the Contractor waives any claim to any
supplement to the price of the Contract for an increase in work, delay therein,
or additional cost of any kind, and any claim to any extension in the Delivery
Deadline or the intermediate deadlines for the Work arising from the Site
conditions referred to in this Clause.










However,
the Parties expressly agree that the discovery of archeological ruins at
the Site shall be considered an event of Force Majeure in accordance with
the terms of the Contract, with application of the provisions of Clause
12.

the Technical Advisor still have not responded, achievement of the Payment
Milestone shall be deemed accepted by the Owner and the Technical
Advisor.










(5)


Under
no circumstances shall the Owner’s or the Technical Advisor’s agreement to
a Payment Milestone imply acceptance of the Work associated therewith,
which acceptance shall in any event remain conditioned upon passing the
Performance Tests and executing the respective Provisional Acceptance
Certificate and, ultimately, the Final Acceptance
Certificate.

Contractor guarantees the durability of the solar modules during the
Guarantee Period, in accordance with the schedule of guarantees made by
the manufacturer of the modules set forth on Annex
6 of this Contract.  Upon expiration of the Guarantee
Period, the Contractor undertakes to assign to the Owner its rights under
the module supplier guarantees through the remainder of the 25-year useful
life of the modules.










8.2


Solar
Module Capacity Guarantee










(1)


The
Contractor guarantees that the total peak capacity of the Solar Park is
equal to or higher than the contracted capacity of 11,850 kWp (which will
be confirmed by the manufacturer’s photoflash certificates). In addition,
all certificates for each module shall be within the rated peak capacity
margin of ***% and all aggregate certificates for each of the Solar
Facilities shall be within the rated peak capacity margin of ***%
(although the Solar Park aggregate can only have a margin with respect to
the above referenced peak capacity of ***%, in which case the Contract
Price shall be reduced proportionately in accordance with the final
reduced peak capacity and the corresponding amount of the final Payment
Milestone contemplated in Clause 4.2 reduced
accordingly).










(2)


In
the event that (i) the total sum of the certificates is less than the
contracted 11,850 kWp (unless it is within the permitted margin for the
Solar Park pursuant to subsection (1) above), or (ii) the certificates do
not comply with the above referenced margins, the Contractor shall
replace, at its expense, solar modules as needed to increase the total
peak capacity of the Solar Park to the minimum permitted under subsection
(1) above, or those modules whose individual capacity is inferior to the
aforementioned tolerance.










(3)


If,
as of the date set forth in Clause 14.1(1)(i), the sum of the
manufacturer’s photoflash certificates demonstrate the peak capacity of
the Solar Park is less than the referenced total peak capacity (unless it
is within the permitted margin for the Solar Park set forth in subsection
(1) above), the Owner may terminate the Contract for Contractor breach in
accordance with the terms of Clause 14.1, and pay the indemnity set forth
in such Clause.










(4)


The
Owner reserves the right to perform capacity tests on the solar module
samples that have been provided at the CIEMAT, CENER or IFE-Frauhofer
laboratories, in accordance with the applicable IEC (International
Electrotechnical Commission) standard in order to confirm their compliance
with the capacity specified by the manufacturer and guaranteed by the
Contractor. The results thereof shall be binding on the Parties. In the
event that such results confirm that the capacity of the modules does not
fall within the tolerance guaranteed by the Contractor, the Contractor
shall bear the costs of such tests and shall immediately replace the
entire batch of modules corresponding to the tested samples, except to the
extent that the modules failing the capacity test can be identified, in
which case, only those modules shall be
replaced.

not entail a reduction in the guaranteed performance of the Solar
Park.














(ii)


With
respect to the module, inverter or solar tracker spare parts that are not
manufactured by the Contractor or by companies of its group, the
Contractor shall use reasonable efforts to (a) cause the respective
suppliers to continue to manufacture such spare parts or other spare parts
with similar characteristics (and, in the case of modules, of equal or
greater capacity), provided they do not entail a reduction of the
guaranteed performance of the Solar Park, or (b) obtain such spare parts
with similar characteristics from other vendors with technical
capabilities that are at least similar to the original
ones.  Should the Contractor become aware that an original
vendor intends to stop manufacturing such spare parts, it shall so notify
the Owner so that the Owner may order, through the Contractor, the spare
parts it deems appropriate, provided they are available on the
market.








Such
spare parts will be supplied at the Owner’s request at the market prices
prevailing from time to time (which shall be paid by the Owner) and within such
reasonable period as the Parties agree, taking into account the characteristics
of the requested spare part.

8.4


Solar
Park Production Guarantee.











(1)


The
Contractor guarantees to the Owner that the aggregate electric output of
the Solar Park during each of the *** periods included in the Production
Guarantee Period shall reach the PR guaranteed pursuant to Annex
10 (the “Guaranteed PR”), for
each determined irradiance and temperature condition, and that in no event
shall it fall beneath the PR minimum set forth in such Annex (the “Minimum
PR”).








In the
event of a partial termination of the Contract in accordance with the provisions
of Clause 14.1, the Guaranteed PR and the Minimum PR shall be applied to the
electric output of the Solar Facilities that were not rejected by the Owner.







(2)


A
Production Test shall be performed at the end of each *** period dividing
the Production Guarantee Period in order to confirm the electrical
output.  For these purposes, within the forty-five (45) days
prior to the termination of the *** period following the commencement date
of the Production Guarantee Period, and within the forty-five (45) days
prior to the termination of the Production Guarantee Period, the
Contractor shall notify the Owner of such circumstance so that the Parties
may agree upon a date the perform the Production Tests for the
corresponding *** period (which, in no event may be later than the date
which is fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of termination of
the period which is *** following the commencement date of the Production
Guarantee Period or the termination date of the Production Guarantee
Period, as applicable). The following shall apply to the results of the
Production Tests for the Solar
Park:














(a)


If
the actual measured output of the Solar Park is less than the Guaranteed
PR for the corresponding *** period (as such term is defined in Annex
10) but is greater than the Minimum PR for such period, the
Contractor shall pay to the Owner the penalties set forth in Annex
10, up to a maximum of ***% of the Contract Price.















(b)


If
the actual measured output of the Solar Park is less than
the  Minimum PR for the corresponding *** period,  the
Owner may elect to: (i) return the entire
Solar Park to the Contractor (or the part thereof that was not rejected in
the event of a partial termination in accordance with the terms of Clause
14.1), the Contractor then being obligated to return the entire Contract
Price paid by the Owner pursuant to this Contract and to indemnify the
Owner for damages pursuant to Clause 14.1(5), or (ii) return the Solar
Facilities causing the failure to achieve the Minimum PR to the
Contractor, the Contractor then being obligated to return the portion of
the Contract Price corresponding to such Solar Facilities and to indemnify
the Owner for damages pursuant to Clause 14.1(5) that correspond to the
returned Solar Facilities.

(3)


If
the Guaranteed PR is reached in the Production Tests for each *** period,
or if the Contractor shall have paid the required penalties for achieving
an output between the Minimum PR and the Guaranteed PR, the Parties shall
execute a certificate of agreement.  The execution of such
certificate corresponding to the second *** period for the Guaranteed
Production Period shall grant the Contractor the right to require the
Owner to return the Guarantee Bond in force at the time and replace the
same with a new Guarantee Bond in an amount equal to ***% of the Contract
Price.  The same provisions of this subsection shall also be
applied to the Solar Facilities, if any, that the Owner did not return in
accordance with subsection
8.4(2)(b).










(4)


The
Contractor shall not be responsible for breach of the guarantees in the
event that such failure was caused by the circumstances described in
Clause 8.3.2(5) above or by excessive failures of the grid coupled with
the disconnection of the inverters for exceeding the conditions detailed
in their technical specifications.















Further,
in the event that a Systemic Defect arises during a Production Guarantee
Period, the data from the Solar Park as a whole shall not considered for
purposes of the Production Guarantee during the time the Contractor is
replacing the equipment affected by such Systemic Defect, up to a maximum
of three (3) months.  Thus, in the event that the Contractor
takes more than three (3) months to replace the Solar Park equipment
affected by a Systemic Defect, only that three (3) month period shall
remain in the Production Guarantee Period. For this purpose, the parties
shall record the suspension periods and corresponding extensions of the
Production Guarantee in writing.















For
clarification purposes, the appearance of a Systemic Defect shall obligate
the Contractor to replace all equipment of the same model and
manufacturer, regardless of whether they have manifested such defect at
the time of their replacement.






















8.5

payment obligation for which the Contractor is responsible from the
commencement of the Work until the date of execution of the Solar Park
Provisional Acceptance Certificate (for any reason, including but not
limited to the return of the amounts paid by the Owner, under this
Contract, and penalties or compensation for damages and losses, including
the performance by the Contractor of its obligations during the portion of
the Guarantee Period prior to the execution of the Solar Park Provisional
Acceptance Certificate).











(2)


As
a requirement for the execution of the Solar Park Provisional Acceptance
Certificate, the Contractor shall deliver to the Owner the Guarantee Bond
(in exchange for the return of the Performance Bond by the Owner), in an
amount equal to ***% of the Contract Price. The Guarantee Bond shall
conform to the form attached hereto as Annex

The
Performance Bond and the Guarantee Bond shall be issued by a financial
institution with a minimum “A” rating by Standard & Poor’s Corporation
or the equivalent from Moody’s Investors Services Inc., and shall be
enforceable, in whole or in part, on demand by the Owner, in the event of
the Contractor’s breach of its obligations under this
Contract.











(4)


The
delivery of the bonds provided under this section shall in no way limit
the Contractor's liability under this Contract, as the bonds only
constitute a means to guarantee the performance of the obligations assumed
by the Contractor.











(5)


If
the Contract Price is amended pursuant to Change Orders, the Contractor
must update the amount of the Performance Bond. To such end, the
Contractor must deliver to the Owner (within fifteen (15) Business Days
following the execution of the corresponding Change Order), another bond
in the updated amount, in the form attached hereto as Annex
7.

Solar Park (which shall not occur later than the Guarantee Period
expiration date).











(2)


If
such inspection does not reveal the presence of defects, the Parties shall
proceed to execute the Final Acceptance Certificate, at which time the
Owner shall return the Guarantee Bond to the
Contractor.











(3)


If
such inspection finds that defects are present that affect the
Contractor's obligations during the Guarantee Period, the Parties shall
sign a certificate specifying the defects, if any, that must be corrected
within a period of forty-five (45) days of the date of execution of the
corresponding certificate, or within such shorter period that the Parties
may agree upon.












***

(6)


After
cessation of the event of Force Majeure, the
Parties shall agree upon the corresponding extension of deadlines (in all
cases in light of the duration of the event of Force Majeure and the
mobilization periods), or, if applicable, the measures that must be
adopted to recover, in whole or in part, the time lost so as to preserve
such dates, if possible. The contractual obligations not affected by Force Majeure must be
met within the deadlines that were in force prior to the occurrence of the
event of Force
Majeure.











(7)


In
any event, upon cessation of the event of Force Majeure, the
Parties shall take all reasonable measures within their power to resume

Work may be continued by reducing the size of the Solar Park, the number
of Solar Facilities, or by implementing a reconfiguration of the technical
configuration of the Solar Park, the Parties shall meet to agree on such
changes and shall execute a certificate describing the changes to the
contractual conditions.  In any event, if the change entails a
reduction in the capacity of the Solar Park, or in the number of Solar
Facilities, thus requiring a reduction of the Contract Price, the Owner
shall have the right to withhold from the remaining Payment Milestones
payable after the change, the portion of the Contract Price previously
paid by the Owner that corresponds to the Solar Facilities or the

or omissions of any of the Parties, the periods of the Implementation
Schedule shall be extended for a period at least equal to the one during
which the situation subsisted, and the Owner shall pay to the Contractor
the duly verified costs incurred as a result of such interruption. The
Contractor undertakes to act diligently to minimize such
costs.











(3)


If
the suspension ordered by any judicial or governmental order, or by the
Owner or the Contractor following the instructions of any judicial or
governmental authority, extends for more than six (6) months, either of
the Parties will be entitled to terminate the Contract upon the terms of
Clause 14.

TERMINATION











14.1


Termination
for Causes Attributable to the
Contractor











(1)


The
Owner may terminate the Contract in the cases authorized by the Law, in
the instances provided for in this Contract, or upon the occurrence of any
of the following events:















a)


The
dissolution or merger (provided it involves a change in control) of the
Contractor ***, or when a substantial portion of the assets of the
Contractor *** is transferred to another company, provided that such
circumstances seriously prejudice the Contractor’s *** capacity to perform
the obligations under this
Contract;















b)


The
voluntary filing by the Contractor of a bankruptcy petition or the
allowance of a bankruptcy petition by a third party against the Contractor
(or any equivalent action in accordance with the insolvency legislation
applicable to the Contractor), or in the case of clear financial
difficulties that prevent the Contractor from normally complying with
obligations arising under the Contract, unless its obligations are
sufficiently guaranteed under this Contract. The occurrence of the same
events as regards *** shall also be grounds for
termination.












***
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED AND

SEPARATELY
FILED WITH THE COMMISSION***

c)


If
the Contractor assigns or subcontracts the Contract, in whole or in part,
without complying with the conditions set forth in this
document.















d)


If
the Contractor fails to comply with its obligations involving the
contracting and maintenance of the insurance provided under the Contract
in a manner that might endanger coverage under the relevant
policies.















e)


If
the Contractor has been assessed penalties for failure to achieve the
Production Guarantee beyond the maximum limits, if applicable, provided
under this Contract.















f)


The
Contractor has interrupted the Work or a substantial portion thereof or
has abandoned the Solar Park for a period exceeding twenty (20) calendar
days without the Owner’s authorization, or in the case of interruptions
for an aggregate duration of more than thirty (30) days within the same
calendar year, provided that the interruptions do not arise from a
suspension of the Work provided under Clause
13.2.















g)


If
the application for the Final Start-up Certificate has not been filed
together with all required in accordance with the terms of Clause 6.6 on
or prior to the Delivery Deadline due to causes attributable to the
Contractor, although the Owner cannot effect termination for the reason
set forth in this subsection with respect to those Solar Facilities or
Electrical Infrastructure for which a Final Start-up Certificate would
have been obtained prior to September 29,
2008.















h)


If
the Owner has not obtained the Final Start-up Certificate (with respect to
one or more Solar Facilities and/or the Electrical Infrastructure) prior
to ***, for the reasons set forth in Clause
6.6(2)(ii).















i)


If
the Provisional Acceptance Certificate for one or more Solar Facilities or
the Electrical Infrastructure has not been issued prior to
***.















j)


***















k)


***















l)


If
there is any other material breach of the obligations assumed by the
Contractor under this Contract.















m)


Any
other serious breach of a principal obligation of the Contractor that
might affect or prevent the successful conclusion of the Contract, or that
is expressly designated herein as grounds for
termination.










(2)


Upon
the occurrence of any of the above events, the Owner may elect to
terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, with respect to the Solar
Facilities for which the Provisional Acceptance Certificate of a Facility
has not been issued as of the date of notice of termination, or for which
the Final Start-up Certificate has not been obtained in the case of
subsections g) and h) above (hereinafter, the “Affected Facilities”),
except to the extent that the number of Affected Facilities is less than
40% of the total Solar Facilities, in which case the Owner may only
terminate the Contract with respect to such Affected
Facilities.








However,
if the Affected Facilities represent less than 40% of the Solar Facilities, the
Owner may elect to terminate the Contract with respect to the entire Solar Park
if one of the termination events set forth in subsections a) or b) has occurred
and the Owner reasonably believes that such circumstances pose a material
prejudice or risk to the performance of the Contractor’s obligations under this
Contract during the Guarantee Period.  The foregoing shall not apply
if the Contractor has provided equipment guarantees, satisfactory to the Owner,
sufficient to ensure proper maintenance and replacement of the Solar Park during
the Guarantee Period and the Contractor has assigned such guarantees to the
Owner pursuant to the terms of this Contract.






***

40

















The above
shall not prejudice the Owner’s option to return the Solar Park in its entirety
upon the occurrence of the circumstance set forth in Clause
8.4(2)(b).






(3)


Upon
the occurrence of any of the above events, the Owner shall give the
Contractor a period of thirty (30) days to remedy the event, or any other
longer period that may be agreed upon by the Parties. If within such
period the Contractor fails to remedy such grounds for termination to the
Owner's satisfaction, the Contract shall be terminated (in whole or in
part, as applicable).  For clarification purposes, it is noted
for the record that in no event will the remedy period provided herein be
applicable to the circumstances provided in subsections (1)(b), (e), (f),
(g) , (h) and (i) of this Clause.











(4)


In
the event of a termination of the Contract (in whole or in part) under
this subsection, the following shall occur (without prejudice to the
provisions of subsection (6)):















(i)


In
the event of partial
termination, only as to some Solar Facilities in the Solar Park,
the Contractor shall be obligated to return to the Owner the portion of
the Contract Price that it charged for the Affected Facilities and shall
be obligated to pay indemnification for any damages pursuant to subsection
(5) below. The Contractor shall recover ownership of the property
comprising such Solar Facilities.















(ii)


In
the event of complete
termination, the Contractor shall be obligated to return the
aggregate Contract Price charged by the Contractor, and shall be obligated
to pay indemnification for any damages pursuant to subsection (5) below.
The Contractor shall recover ownership of all the property delivered to
the Owner.












***
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED AND

41



















(5)


Upon
the occurrence of either two events described in the preceding subsection,
the Contractor shall be obligated to pay indemnification to the Owner for
damages, including:















(i)


The
Financial Costs associated with the Affected Facilities or the entire
Solar Park, as applicable.  “Financial Costs” shall
be understood to mean all costs, expenses, fees (whether up-front, early
termination or of any other type) and interest paid by the Owner in
respect of the financing documents entered into by the Owner with the
Financial Institutions, including cancellation or breakage fees for any
interest rate swap agreements entered into by the Owner with the Financial
Institutions.









The
Contractor acknowledges the validity of the amount, as determined by the Agent
under the financing documents, to be provided in the settlement statement that
will be delivered by the Agent to the Owner in which the factors used to
calculate the Financing Costs with respect to the Solar Facility or Facilities
or the Solar Park, as applicable, will be described.










(ii)


The
costs, expenses and damages incurred by the Owner as a result of, or with
respect to, the early termination or the breach by the Contractor, duly
certified by the Owner, plus an amount equal to *** euros for each
Affected Facility (i.e., *** euros in the event of total termination or
the amount that corresponds to the Affected Facilities in the event of a
partial termination), to cover permitting
costs.









Concurrently
with the payments provided for in subsections 15.1(4) and 15.1(5), the Owner
agrees to take all necessary actions which are in its control to assign to the
Contractor, or its designee, ownership title (free of encumbrances and liens) to
the permits and authorizations relating to the Affected Facilities (or the Solar
Park in its entirety in the event of total termination), as well as
corresponding usage rights (free of encumbrances and liens) to the part of the
Site on which such Affected Facilities are located and the contractual rights in
those contracts relating to the Solar Park with respect to the Affected
Facilities.  For purposes of this paragraph, it shall be understood
that the Owner has assigned (free of encumbrances and liens) all permits and
authorizations for the Affected Facilities or the Solar Park, as applicable,
upon delivery to the Contractor of all documentation required by the Contractor
(and which must be contributed by the grantor) to immediately request the
approval by the competent administrative entity for the assignment of such
permits and authorizations.




In the
event that a special purpose entity holds title to such permits and
authorizations and usage rights to the Site, the Owner agrees to transfer to the
Contractor, free of encumbrances and liens, all shares or participations
representing the entire share capital of such special purpose entity (provided
that such entity only holds title to the Affected Facilities).

42

















For
clarification purposes, in no event shall the above-referenced obligation be
construed as an obligation to achieve a specific result, and the Owner does not
assume any responsibility in the event that the assignment of the permits and
authorizations referred to in the previous paragraph cannot be completed as a
result of the failure to receive approval (when necessary) for such assignment
from the relevant government administration or entity or the Contractor’s
failure to comply with the requirements imposed on the Contractor by the holders
of such permits or authorizations.






(6)


Notwithstanding
the provisions of subsections (4) and (5), if the Owner had the right to
terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, as a result of the failure to
achieve Start-up prior to September 29, 2008 for the reasons set forth in
subsections 14.1(g) and 14.1(h) above, the Owner may not elect to return
the Affected Facilities, if:















(i)


prior
to September 29, 2008 the Contractor pays to the Owner an amount that is
sufficient to (a) restore the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in
the financing documents referred to in Clause 14.1(5)(i)) to the Base Case
(as defined in the financing documents referred to in Clause 14.1(5)(i))
agreed to by the Financial Institutions and the Owner in such financing
documents, and (b) cover the loss of profitability for the Owner’s
shareholders, taking into account the tariffs which will be received by
the Owner from the sale of power from the Solar Park. For such purposes,
the Contractor acknowledges and accepts that the amount to be paid to the
Owner (for the items set forth in the preceding subsection) will be
proposed by the Agent for the Financial Institutions and negotiated
between the Owner and the Contractor on the basis of the assumptions in
the Base Case developed by the Owner and the Financial Institutions in
connection with the financing documents;
and















(ii)


Start-up
of the Affected Facilities shall have occurred prior to October 31,
2008.









The Owner may require the return of the
Solar Facilities for which the above requirements and Contractor payments have
not been met, each in accordance with the provisions of subsection (5)
above.






(7)


The
Contractor is required to pay the amounts referred to in subsections (4)
and (5) above to the Owner within *** days of the date of settlement of
the amounts owed.











(8)


In
all the foregoing instances, the Owner may, without prejudice to the
reservation of rights to take all legal action to which it is entitled for
the defense of its rights, adopt any or all of the following
measures:












***
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED AND

43























a)


Offset
any payments pending in favor of the Contractor by an amount equivalent to
the balance in favor of the Owner (returning, in the event of complete
termination, the Performance Bond or the Guarantee Bond, as applicable,
once such offset has been made).















b)


Enforce
the Performance Bond and/or the Guarantee
Bond.















c)


Withhold
the Contractor’s materials, machinery and items belonging to the
Contractor that are in the possession of the Owner, until the Contractor
has fully paid all amounts due as a consequence of the
termination.











14.2


Termination
by the Contractor











(1)


The
Contractor may terminate the Contract under the circumstances provided for
under applicable law, in this Contract, or upon occurrence of any of the
following events:















(i)


The
voluntary filing by the Owner of a bankruptcy petition or the allowance of
a bankruptcy petition filed by a third party against the Owner, or in the
event of patent financial difficulties that would prevent the Owner from
normally complying with the obligations arising under this Contract in
cases different from the one provided under subsection (ii) below, unless
its obligations are sufficiently guaranteed under this
Contract.















(ii)


A
delay in payment for a period in excess of sixty (60) days from the date
on which payment should have been
made.















(iii)


Any
other serious breach of a principal obligation of the Owner that might
affect or prevent the successful conclusion of the Contract, or that is
expressly designated herein as grounds for
termination.















(iv)


A
suspension of the works and services for causes attributable to the Owner
for a period greater than three (3)
months.















(v)


The
dissolution of the Owner, or if a substantial portion of the assets of the
Owner is transferred to another company, and such circumstance seriously
prejudices the Owner’s capacity to perform the obligations set forth in
this Contract.











(2)


The
Contractor shall give to the Owner a period of thirty (30) days to cure
the event, or any other longer period that may be agreed upon by the
Parties. Such cure period shall not apply if the event giving rise to
grounds for termination is one provided for in subsections (i) and (iv) of
Clause 14.2(1) above. If the Owner fails to remedy such grounds for
termination to the Contractor's satisfaction within such period, the
Contract shall be terminated (in whole or in part, as
applicable).

(3)


Upon
termination of the Contract for any of the foregoing reasons, the Owner
must:















(i)


Pay
all of the Contractor’s outstanding
invoices.















(ii)


Pay
to the Contractor the value of the Work performed before termination and
which is not yet included in the invoices. Accordingly, the Owner must pay
to the Contractor the cost of the equipment already delivered to the
Contractor or that it is legally required to accept under the contracts
entered into with its suppliers and manufacturers, which shall become the
property of the Owner if they had not already become
so.








However,
the Contractor undertakes to take such actions necessary or appropriate to
minimize the costs referred in this subsection. The Contractor shall include the
provisions required to that effect in the contracts with suppliers and
subcontractors.









(iii)


Pay
all duly authenticated damages that are sustained by the Contractor as a
consequence of the contractual breach or early termination, including
direct demobilization costs.















(iv)


Return
to the Contractor the Bonds received from the

Upon
the Owner’s compliance with the conditions set forth in the above
subsection, the Contractor shall abandon the Site within a period of

another contractor, the Owner being entitled to request the Contractor to
assign each and every contract signed by the Contractor and its
subcontractors  (except contracts entered into for the supply of
solar modules, supports and trackers or for the supply of technology and
software, which the Owner may not assume). The Contractor is obligated to
cooperate in good faith with the Owner to effect such
assignments.











14.3


Termination

Majeure















In
the event of termination of the Contract due to an event of Force Majeure, the
provisions of subsections 14.2 (3) (i), (ii) and (iv) above shall
apply.

part, the economic, commercial or financial rights or credits arising

part, regarding such rights and credits, unless it has obtained the prior
written approval of the Owner and the Financial Institutions. An
assignment to other companies within the Contractor’s group that have the
same technical capacity to perform the contractual obligations and that
satisfy the requirements of the Direct Agreement is permitted,
***.

accordance with Clause 17, or to any other third party with the prior
written approval of the Contractor.











15.2


Subcontracting











(1)


The
Contractor may subcontract the Work, provided the following conditions are
met:















(i)


All
the subcontracts executed (except the contracts entered into for the
supply and manufacture of solar modules, supports and trackers or for the
supply of technology and software, which Owner may not assume) and all
guarantees obtained from any of the suppliers or Subcontractors may be
assigned at the request of the Owner in the event of termination of this
Contract. For such purpose, the Contractor irrevocably undertakes to
assign to the Owner and the Financial Institutions the rights arising from
all the guarantees and subcontracts obtained from Authorized
Subcontractors upon the expiration of the Guarantee Period or in the event
of termination of the Contract.















(ii)


The
guarantees or subcontracts executed by the Contractor with Subcontractors
or suppliers shall be consistent with the terms and provisions of this
Contract.















(iii)


The
Contractor shall deliver to the Owner, within a reasonable period after
the request thereof, a copy without prices or other commercial terms, of
all the contracts, agreements and guarantees signed with the
Subcontractors (containing the waiver referred to in subsection (3)
below)











(2)


In
no event shall a contractual relationship be implied among the
Subcontractors and the Owner. The Contractor shall remain liable for all
of the activities of its Subcontractors and suppliers and for all
contractual and labor obligations arising from the performance of their
work; as well as for the actions, failures and negligence of any of its
subcontractors or suppliers and the agents and employees thereof, under
the same terms and conditions as if committed or performed by the
Contractor itself, its agents or
employees.











(3)


The
Owner shall not be liable vis-à-vis any Subcontractor or supplier, or
vis-à-vis their employees, for any claims arising directly or indirectly
from the Contract. For such purpose, the Contractor undertakes to procure

the Civil Code from each
Subcontractor.

16.


LIABILITY
AND DAMAGES











(1)


The
Parties shall have the obligation to provide indemnification for those
damages caused to the other Party as a consequence of the breach of this
Contract. The Owner’s approval of the projects, calculations, drawings or
other technical documents prepared by the Contractor, or the conduct of
inspections or Tests do not release the Contractor from such liability,
and do not imply that such liability must be shared by the
Owner.















Further,
the recommendations made by the Owner or its representatives during the
performance of the Contract or on occasion of inspections or Tests shall
not give rise to an exemption, mitigation or excuse for the Contractor’s
performance under this Contract, except to the extent such recommendations
or observations were implemented despite the Contractor’s
objection.











(2)


The
Contractor shall be liable vis-à-vis the Owner for any loss or physical
damage to the equipment, materials or assets owned by the Owner or third
parties that is caused by the Contractor through the execution of the
relevant Solar Facility Provisional Acceptance Certificate, and thereafter
only when the Contractor is within the Site performing the Work, repairs
or similar activities and causes the relevant
damage.









If the
Contractor fails to hold the Owner or the third parties harmless from the
above-mentioned damages, the Owner shall be entitled to redress such damages,
deducting the costs of repair from any amounts pending payment to the
Contractor, or by enforcement of the Bonds issued pursuant to this
Contract.






(3)


By
application of Article 1596 of the Civil Code, it is expressly agreed that
the Contractor shall also be liable for damages caused by the persons or
entities employed by the Contractor in the performance of the Work,
whether as employees, technicians, subcontractors or otherwise, from whom
the same diligence owed by the Contractor shall be
required.











(4)


The
Parties expressly agree that in no event will a Party be liable for the
so-called consequential or indirect damages, including loss of profits and
loss of output, loss of use or loss of any contract or other damages that
are considered to be indirect, except for cases involving willful
misconduct or gross negligence, and without prejudice to the Contractor's
obligation to pay the penalties agreed upon under this
Contract.











(5)


The
Parties agree that any indemnity received by one of the Parties as
beneficiary of any of the insurance taken out by them in connection with
the Solar Park will be deducted from the respective claim for damages or,
if such indemnity holds the Party in question harmless from the damages
sustained, it shall bar such Party from claiming damages and require it to
refund the excess, if any.  The Party causing the damages shall
bear all deductibles, liability limits and any other deductions affecting
the indemnities payable to the damaged Party by the insurance companies
providing the insurance in accordance with the provisions
hereof.

(6)


The
maximum total liability of the Contractor hereunder shall not exceed, in
the aggregate, an amount equal to *** (***%) percent of the Contract
Price. The foregoing shall not affect to the Contractor’s obligation to
make payments under Clause 14.1 in the event of the termination or partial
termination of the Contract.

CONFIDENTIALITY











(1)


The
Parties agree that this Contract and the Annexes hereto, and any written
or electronic information or documentation that any of the Parties
furnishes to the other for the performance of this Contract (including,
without limitation, technical documentation, plans, information,
procedures, patents and licenses) are confidential. Therefore, the Parties
undertake to keep the information confidential and to refrain from
disclosing, providing to third parties or using such information unless
such documentation and information (i) is known by the public without any
breach of this confidentiality commitment, (ii) has been legally obtained
from a third party, (iii) is requested by a judicial or governmental
authority, or (iv) the delivery of such documentation and information is
made in compliance with any legal obligations enforced upon the disclosing
Party.











(2)


The

development of the investigations, assessments and works carried out by
them, provided that, in each and every one of such cases, the parties
receiving the confidential information have assumed commitments of
confidentiality vis-à-vis the disclosing party on terms similar to this
one. In this case, such entities, authorities, advisors or auditors shall
have free access to the books, files, documents and information held by
the requested Party, and prior authorization is therefore not required
from the other Parties to furnish information to such entities,
authorities, advisors and/or auditors regarding this Contract and the
Annexes hereto and any other information or written documentation relating
hereto.











(3)


In
particular, the Owner is authorized to transmit information regarding this

Form of Performance
Bond




[Name of the
Bank] (hereinafter, the “BANK”) hereby furnishes to
SUNPOWER ENERGY SYSTEMS, S.L.U.
with a registered address at [l], recorded in [l] (hereinafter the
“Guaranteed Party”) an
irrevocable, absolute, guarantee payable on demand to [l] (the “Beneficiary”), guaranteeing
the performance of all payment obligations assumed by the Guaranteed Party
vis-à-vis the Beneficiary (hereinafter, the “Guaranteed Obligations”) under
the Turnkey Construction Contract entered into by and between the Guaranteed
Party and the Beneficiary on even date herewith with respect to the construction
and start-up of a solar park located in [l] (hereinafter, the
“Contract”).




The BANK
understands and acknowledges that the right to require the prior exhaustion of
the debtor’s assets, the right to require the prior exhaustion of remedies
against the debtor, and the benefit of division of the debt (beneficios de excusión, orden y
division), or any other rights, powers or exceptions that tend to prevent
or delay payment to the Beneficiary of the guaranteed amount shall not be
applicable to this Bond, waiving such benefits of the right to require the prior
exhaustion of the debtor’s assets, the right to require the prior exhaustion of
remedies against the debtor, and the benefit of division of the debt, and any
other rights, powers or exceptions to which the BANK may be entitled.
Additionally, the BANK shall attend to its payment obligation upon first demand
of the Beneficiary, even in the event of objection to payment by the Guaranteed
Party.




The
Beneficiary may seek payment directly from the BANK to obtain performance of the
Guaranteed Obligations. The BANK shall make payment of the amounts claimed under
this Bond upon receipt of the timely requests and without requiring the prior
enforcement of any other guarantee furnished in relation to the Guarantee
Obligations or any other action whatsoever. The BANK shall pay the amounts due
on sight, without the need to seek any consent from the Guaranteed Party. The
BANK shall be liable vis-à-vis the Beneficiary for up to a maximum amount of
[l].




This Bond
may be enforced on one or more occasions, up to the maximum amount set forth
above.




Consequently,
the BANK shall pay to the Beneficiary any amount up to the guaranteed amount
within a period of five (5) Business Days from the date payment is requested by
the Beneficiary through a written request in which the Beneficiary confirms the
existence of a breach and the cause thereof according to the relevant provision
of the Contract, without it being necessary for the Beneficiary to submit any
additional documentation or evidence whatsoever.




All sums
due from the BANK under this Bond shall be paid net of any indirect tax,
withholding or commission and without any type of offset or deduction. If the
BANK, in the performance of this Bond, is forced by any rule or governmental or
judicial authority to make any kind of offset, tax payment, withholding or
deduction from the payments to the Beneficiary, the BANK shall pay to the
Beneficiary any additional amount necessary to ensure that the net amount
received by the Beneficiary (free of indirect taxes, set-offs, deductions or
withholdings) is equal to the amount that the Beneficiary would have received if
such set-off, deduction or withholding from the BANK’s payment was not
required.

the BANK. In particular, they shall remain in full force even if the Guaranteed

situation related to their solvency. Furthermore, the Guaranteed Obligations
shall not be deemed satisfied and shall remain in full force and effect if the
Beneficiary, for any cause and at any time, is required to return the payments
made by the BANK under the Bond. Additionally, the BANK represents that the
scope of the guarantee granted under this Bond shall not be modified in any way
due to any action that the Beneficiary or the BANK may take with respect to
approval of any agreement that might result from the bankruptcy of the
Guaranteed Party, the BANK’s obligation remaining unchanged under the agreed
terms as if such action did not occur.




This Bond
shall automatically expire on the date of execution of the Solar Park
Provisional Acceptance Certificate, and in any event, on January 31, 2009, on
which date the right to demand payment shall expire.




The terms
of this Guarantee may not be unilaterally amended by the BANK, the written

providing the financing for the payments contemplated in the
Contracts.

That certain Agreement for Guaranteed Maximum Price Construction Services between Owner and
Contractor for Wynn Las Vegas (“Project”) dated as of June 4, 2002 (“Contract”) is hereby modified as follows:


1.	DEFINITIONS.



Initial capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Change Order shall have the meanings attributed to such terms in the Contract.



2.	SCOPE OF WORK



As provided in Section 15.1.1 of the Contract, the Owner, at its sole expense, implemented an Owner Controlled Insurance Program (OCIP) to furnish certain insurance coverages
with respect to the on-Site activities of the Contractor and Subcontractors. The OCIP was established for the benefit of the Owner and Contractor and Subcontractors of all tiers who have performed Work on-Site.



The original Guaranteed Maximum Price in the Contract reflected a credit of $18,000,000.00, based upon the parties’ best efforts to estimate the construction cost savings to be
realized as a result of the Owner’s furnishing of the insurance coverages provided under the OCIP. Based on Change Orders No. 4 & 5, the amount of the credit for projected savings for the OCIP was increased from $18,000,000 to
$19,867,980.



Section 15.1.3 of the Contract provides that at the end of the Project, prior to Final Payment, the Guaranteed Maximum Price will be adjusted as a result of any variance
between the actual savings amount and projected savings established by the foregoing credit amount, pursuant to an OCIP audit.









Section 12.2.1.16 of the Contract requires that as a condition to Final Payment and Final Completion, an OCIP audit be prepared and reasonably approved by Owner which reflects
the actual savings amount from the OCIP.



Contractor having achieved Final Completion for all Work areas covered by the OCIP, an OCIP audit was conducted by the OCIP Administrator and Contractor and Owner have agreed upon
the results of the OCIP audit. Owner and Contractor agree that based upon the OCIP audit, the actual savings amount for the OCIP is $24,236,418.



The following is a summary level recap of the results of the OCIP Audit:

Accordingly, pursuant to Section 15.1.3 of the Contract, and the procedures outlined in Section E of the OCIP Manual attached as Exhibit P to the Contract, the
Guaranteed Maximum Price is to be adjusted to reflect the variance between the actual savings amount of the OCIP ($24,236,418) as determined by the OCIP audit, and the projected savings established by the total OCIP credit amount ($19,867,980)
provided for in the Guaranteed Maximum Price based on the original Contract as increased by Change Orders No. 4 & 5, by applying such variance ($4,368,438) as a further credit to the Guaranteed Maximum Price, thereby reducing the Guaranteed
Maximum Price to account for the OCIP variance.



3.	DECREASE TO GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE



The GMP set forth in Section 3.1 of the Contract is by this Change Order hereby decreased, by $4,368,438 (equaling the amount of the variance in the OCIP credit), from
$1,133,479,322 to $1,129,110,884 as detailed in Paragraph 2 above. From and after the date of this Change Order, any and all references in the Contract Documents to the “Guaranteed Maximum Price” shall mean the amount
of $1,129,110,884.



Owner and Contractor agree, acknowledge and accept the results of the OCIP audit as set forth in Paragraph 2 above, and the application of the variance and the adjustment to
the Guaranteed Maximum Price as set forth in this Paragraph 3, as full and complete satisfaction of the OCIP Audit and the requirements of Sections 12.2.1.16 and 15.1.3 of the Contract.



4.	RETAINAGE.

This  agreement  ("Agreement")  is made and entered into as of the 20th day
of June, 1996 (the "Effective Date"), by and between:  Morgan Associates,  Inc.,
a Kansas corporation,  hereinafter  referred to as "MORGAN",  and Enron Liquids
Pipeline Operating  Limiting  Partnership,  a Delaware limited  partnership,
hereinafter referred to as "ELPOLP".

WITNESSETH THAT:

WHEREAS,  MORGAN desires the  performance  by an independent  contractor of
certain  Work  pertaining  to  the  engineering,  procurement,  management,  and
construction of a certain Odessa Lateral and Meter facility (the "Facilities").

NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration of the amount(s) of money to be paid by
MORGAN to ELPOLP, and other mutual covenants,  agreements and obligations of the
parties hereinafter set forth, the parties do hereby agree as follows:

1.   Scope of Work.  ELPOLP shall  furnish  and  pay  for all costs and expenses
associated  with the  acquisition  of  MORGAN's  Premises,  and any  labor,
supervision,  tools,  technical  capability,   transportation,   materials,
supplies,  and all  other  items or  accessories  necessary  for  ELPOLP to
perform and accomplish the Work defined and described in Exhibit "A" and in
accordance  with the terms,  conditions,  and standards of this  Agreement,
including the Plans and Specifications in Exhibit "B" (the "Work"). As part
of the Work,  ELPOLP  shall  prepare  and  deliver  to MORGAN  all  design,
construction,  operation and maintenance  information,  including,  but not
limited to, "as-built"  drawings,  schematics  and flow diagrams as MORGAN
may  reasonably  require for the ongoing  operation and  maintenance of the
Facilities.

2.   Rights of Way.  ELPOLP  will  research  title  and  prepare  the  documents
required to obtain and acquire on behalf of MORGAN all Work  places,  land,
rights of way grants, permits,  easements,  surface easements, fee property
(including all land) necessary for the Facilities (hereinafter collectively
defined as "MORGAN's  Premises"),  which  MORGAN's  Premises shall include,
without limitation:  (a) permanent easement rights pursuant to the Pipeline
Easement  (the  "Southdown   Easement")   dated  November  29,  1995,  from
Southdown,  Inc., aka Southwestern  Portland Cement Company,  over the real
property described  therein;  (b) permanent easement rights pursuant to the
Pipeline  Easement  (the "P&C  Easement")  dated  November 28,  1995,  from
Pevehouse & Christensen Ranch Corporation, over the real property described
therein, and (c) permanent real

<PAGE>



property  interests as necessary to accommodate the metering  facilities to
be constructed as part of the Facilities (the "Meter  Easement").  ELPOLP's
title research and document  preparation in connection with  acquisition of
MORGAN's Premises shall be in accordance with ELPOLP's  internal  standards
and practices for  acquisition  of similar rights of way,  easements,  etc.
ELPOLP will supply MORGAN with information  pertaining to title  research
and document  preparation in connection with MORGAN's Premises.  MORGAN may
request additional title research or changes to the documents as MORGAN may
feel necessary.  Should ELPOLP be unable to acquire the necessary rights of
way at a reasonable cost, or if escalated,  at a cost acceptable to MORGAN,
on or before June 15,  1996,  this  agreement  and all further  obligations
hereunder shall terminate.  Unless otherwise approved in writing by MORGAN,
ELPOLP  will  acquire  on  behalf of MORGAN  permanent  rights to  MORGAN's
Premises by the payment of a one-time  lump sum amount for each  respective
right of way,  easement,  etc.  (such lump sum payments to be included as
part of the Contract Price  hereunder),  and there will be no requirement
for  payment  of  periodic  fees  (e.g.,  lease or  royalty  payments)  for
retaining rights to or use of MORGAN's Premises.

3.   Term.  This  Agreement  shall  commence  on the  Effective  Date and  shall
automatically  terminate upon MORGAN's  acceptance of the Work and MORGAN's
payment therefore to ELPOLP as described herein.

4.   Price.  MORGAN as total  consideration for the Work to be performed,  shall
pay  ELPOLP  the  total  accumulated  costs  of  supervision,  engineering,
procurement  services,  costs  of the  acquisition  of  MORGAN's  Premises,
materials,  costs of rights of way, rights of temporary ingress and egress,
damages to landowners,  fees, bonds,  insurance,  losses not compensated by
insurance,  inspection  services,  direct and  contract  and  subcontracted
labor,  transportation  and living  expenses,  use of furnished  equipment,
commissioning,   permitting,   project   documentation,   taxes,  supplies,
equipment and services,  interest  incurred from initial  expenditure until
final payment has been received,  and all other costs and expenses incurred
by ELPOLP in the  performance  and  completion  of the Work,  not to exceed
$2,000,000.00 (the "Contract  Price").  In the event that ELPOLP determines
that  the  total  costs  and  expenses  which  it has or will  incur in the
performance  and  completion  of the Work (i.e.,  in order to complete  the
Facilities  pursuant to the  standards  defined and described in Exhibits A
and B hereto) will exceed $2,000,000.00, ELPOLP will promptly notify MORGAN
of such circumstance,  providing reasonable details regarding the basis for
such  increased  costs and expenses and the total expected cost and expense
for  completion of the  Facilities.  Upon  receiving such written notice of
expected cost increase, MORGAN may elect to either (i) approve the cost

2

<PAGE>



increase,  in which event the "Contract  Price" shall  thereafter  mean the
revised  amount  that  has  been  designated  by  ELPOLP  as the  cost  for
completing the Work, or (ii) elect not to proceed with the  construction of
the Facilities or completion of the Work,  and in such event,  MORGAN shall
convey to ELPOLP, without any warranties, title to MORGAN's Premises and to
all Work in process, completed Work, supplies, and other materials produced
or acquired for the Work,  and ELPOLP shall refund and  reimburse to MORGAN
any and all amounts which MORGAN has paid or advanced hereunder.

Should  MORGAN  authorize  ELPOLP to perform  additional  Work which is not
within  the scope and  intent of this  Agreement,  such Extra Work shall be
reimbursed in accordance with Paragraph 11 of this Agreement.

5.   General Payment Conditions.

(a)  Following  completion of the Work (but not earlier than July 1, 1996),
ELPOLP  shall  prepare  an invoice  (the  "Invoice")  for the total  amount
accrued to ELPOLP for the Work (but which may not be more than the Contract
Price unless agreed to as provided in Paragraph 4). MORGAN shall pay ELPOLP
the amount  accrued as shown by the  Invoice,  less any amounts  reflecting
payment that may have been made on previous  invoices,  within  thirty (30)
days after  receipt of the Invoice by MORGAN.  Submission of the Invoice by
ELPOLP to MORGAN shall constitute  ELPOLP's  acknowledgement  and agreement
that the  "Initial  Transportation  Date" has  occurred  under that certain
Transportation   Agreement   between  MORGAN  and  ELPOLP  related  to  the
Facilities   and   that  all   conditions   precedent   to  such   "Initial
Transportation Date" have been satisfied.

(b) MORGAN's  payment of the Invoice or MORGAN's earlier shipment of carbon
dioxide through the Facilities shall constitute  MORGAN'S acceptance of the
Work.  Acceptance by ELPOLP of such final payment shall constitute a waiver
by it of all  claims  against  MORGAN  related  to or  arising  out of this
Agreement.  Such final  acceptance and payment by either party hereto shall
not,  however,  release  either  party  from  any  unperformed  obligations
hereunder.

(c) It is understood and the parties hereto agree that the sums to be paid,
as set forth  above,  shall be the entire  consideration  to be received by
ELPOLP from  MORGAN for the Work  performed  hereunder,  and that said sums
shall include any and all taxes and contributions as set forth in Paragraph
14  hereinbelow.  ELPOLP shall,  where  applicable,  separately list on its
invoices all valid sales taxes on services provided hereunder.

10.  Representations, Warranties and Guarantees. With respect to this Agreement,
ELPOLP covenants, warrants, guarantees and represents to MORGAN that:


(a) The Work  will be  accomplished  in good and  workmanlike  manner  with
approved  practices and  standards of the industry,  and with all plans and
specifications  made a part of this  Agreement.  ELPOLP  shall  employ such
methods,  tools,  equipment, and subcontractors in the performance of the
Work under this Agreement as will ensure Work of reasonable accuracy.

(b)  ELPOLP has authority to do business in the state in which the Work  is
to be performed.

(c) ELPOLP shall comply with all valid applicable federal,  state and local
laws, ordinances and regulations thereunder, issued or promulgated by units
of government and regulatory  bodies with  jurisdiction  over any aspect of
the Work.

(d)  Upon  completion  of the  Work,  the  site as it  relates  to the Work
performed  by ELPOLP will comply with the  requirements  of all permits and
all  valid  and  applicable   statutes,   ordinances,   orders,  rules  and
regulations  of  the  federal,   state,   and  local   governments   having
jurisdiction thereof.

(e) During the "Warranty Period" (hereinafter defined), ELPOLP shall repair
or correct at its expense any defects due to ELPOLP's  faulty  workmanship.
In any event,  ELPOLP's liability therefor shall be limited to the Contract
Price.  ELPOLP's  sole  obligation  to  MORGAN  with  regard  to  repair or
corrective Work required of any supplier of equipment or materials provided
by ELPOLP  hereunder and not  manufactured  by ELPOLP shall be to assign to
MORGAN the  warranty or guarantee  of such  supplier  and to cooperate  and
assist MORGAN in MORGAN's  enforcement  of its remedies and if requested by
MORGAN to  perform  any such  repair or  corrective  Work at cost less such
credits  as  are  recovered  from  such  supplier.  ELPOLP  guarantees  the
workmanship for a period of twelve (12) months from MORGAN's  acceptance of
the Work (the  "Warranty  Period").  EXCEPT AS  SPECIFICALLY  WARRANTED  BY
ELPOLP UNDER THIS  AGREEMENT,  ELPOLP MAKES NO OTHER  WARRANTY,  EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED,  INCLUDING  ANY  WARRANTY OF FITNESS OR  MERCHANTABILITY,  AND ANY
STATUTORY  WARRANTIES  OR  REMEDIES  INCONSISTENT  WITH THIS  CONTRACT  ARE
EXPRESSLY  WAIVED.  THE FOREGOING SHALL BE APPLICABLE EVEN IF THE LIABILITY
ASSERTED IS BASED ON THE  NEGLIGENCE  (WHETHER  ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER
FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED, AND REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THE ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT,  TORT, WARRANTY,  STATUTE
OR OTHERWISE.

11.  Extra Work - Changes.  MORGAN may require ELPOLP to perform work or furnish
materials or equipment, or the use thereof, in

5

<PAGE>



connection  with  the  Work  which  are  not  included  in  this  Agreement
(hereinafter  referred to as "Extra Work"). Extra Work may be occasioned by
major changes in pipeline specifications or routing requiring  additional
work or materials of a materially different nature, kind and cost from that
contemplated  at  the  time  of  execution  of  this  Agreement,  or the
performance  of other or additional  work incident to the completion of the
project or facilities  herein  involved,  but not in  contemplation  of the
parties at the time of execution of this Agreement.

ELPOLP  shall not  perform  any Extra Work  without  first  having  secured
written  authorization  from  MORGAN  which  shall be  signed  by  MORGAN's
Representative.  Such authorization  shall describe the Work to be done and
specify  the price to be paid  therefor,  or the basis on which  such price
shall be calculated.

12.  Termination and Interruption.

(a) In the event that the Work may be delayed due to any federal, state, or
other regulatory  authority taking any action,  or refraining from doing an
act, or should any other  condition arise from such  authorities  which may
cause a delay of the Work,  ELPOLP  shall  make all  reasonable  efforts to
resolve  such a delay.  However,  in the event such  efforts do not satisfy
said  authorities  (or the cause of such  delay) and the Work is  therefore
indefinitely  delayed,  which, in ELPOLP's or MORGAN's reasonable judgment,
shall make it  unreasonable  for ELPOLP to proceed  with all or any part of
the Work under this Agreement,  MORGAN and ELPOLP may terminate the Work by
giving the other  party  five (5) days  written  Notice of such  partial or
complete cancellation or termination.

If Work is so terminated after  commencement of any Work hereunder,  MORGAN
shall pay ELPOLP for Work which has been  satisfactorily  performed  to the
date of  termination  for  which  ELPOLP  has not  previously  been paid by
MORGAN,  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement,  including  ELPOLP's  costs
associated  with  proposal  preparation,   the  purchase  of  equipment  or
materials  or  supplies,  the  acquisition  of rights of way and  rights of
ingress  and  egress,  the  hiring  of  Subcontractors,  and the  hiring or
reassignment  of  employees  assigned to the Work and any other  charges or
costs associated with the cessation of the Work.

(b) Upon notice of termination pursuant to this Paragraph:

1.   ELPOLP shall discontinue further Work so terminated.


6

<PAGE>



2.   ELPOLP and/or its  contractors and  subcontractors  shall have the
right to remove its equipment,  tool sand appliances from the site
of the Work (and in either case its personnel).

3.   ELPOLP shall transfer title and deliver to
MORGAN the Work in process, completed Work,
supplies, and other materials produced or
acquired for the Work terminated, as well as
the completed or partially completed plans,
Drawings, information, and other property
that, if the Agreement had been completed,
would be required to be furnished to MORGAN.
"Drawings" as used herein shall mean all graphs,  depictions, and
other visual layouts prepared by ELPOLP to describe the Work.

4.   Morgan shall thereafter assume all
obligations, commitments and other
liabilities that ELPOLP has therefore
incurred or made in connection with its
performance of the Work and for which ELPOLP
has not been paid and released; provided,
however, that MORGAN shall not be required
to make any payments to ELPOLP in excess of
the Contract Price.

Failure of MORGAN or ELPOLP to exercise any of the rights given it
under this  paragraph in any  instance or  instances  shall not be
deemed or adjudged a waiver of such right in other instances.

Termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any
obligation  accruing  or accrued to the date of such  termination,
nor  deprive  a  party  not in  default  of any  remedy  otherwise
available to it. The indemnification  provisions of this Agreement
shall  survive such  termination  relative to all claims and other
indemnified matters,  discovered or undiscovered,  arising out of,
in connection with, or incident to this Agreement.

(c)  MORGAN  or  ELPOLP  may  temporarily  interrupt  or shut down all or a
portion of the Work hereunder upon reasonable advance Notice, if any state,
federal, or other regulatory  authority shall take any action or shall fail
to issue or shall withhold any  authorization,  which shall make proceeding
with the Work inadvisable or imprudent.  If all or a portion of the Work is
thus temporarily shut down,  ELPOLP shall be paid its  unrecoverable  costs
and expenses incurred directly applicable to such interruption.

13.  Force  Majeure.  No  delays in or  failure or  omission  in the performance
of any  obligation  under this  Agreement by ELPOLP or  MORGAN,  other than
payment of money, shall constitute

7

<PAGE>



default under this  Agreement if and to the extent such delay or failure of
performance  is caused  by  occurrences  beyond  the  control  of ELPOLP or
MORGAN,  and which by the  exercise of due  diligence  such party shall not
have been able to avoid or overcome, including, but not limited to: acts of
God or the public  enemy;  expropriation  or  confiscation  of  facilities;
compliance with any order or request of any governmental authority;  fires,
floods,  explosion,  accidents;  strikes,  walkouts or other concerted work
stoppages. In the event that ELPOLP has not secured all easements,  permits
and licenses required of it in order to proceed with the construction phase
of the Work,  or in the event of any other force majeure  condition,  which
force majeure condition prevents ELPOLP from commencing construction of the
facilities  contemplated  herein, the construction of such facilities shall
not begin until such easements,  permits, and licenses are secured. If such
time delay or other force majeure  condition causes an increase to ELPOLP's
labor, equipment, or material costs to complete the Work by the Date stated
herein,  or such later date if force majeure causes delay to  construction,
ELPOLP shall furnish to MORGAN  supporting  documentation  evidencing  such
increase in costs,  and ELPOLP shall be paid such increase in costs. In the
event  of a force  majeure  occurrence,  the  party  whose  performance  is
prevented by such occurrence  shall notify the other party, in writing,  as
soon as  reasonably  possible and give full  particulars  thereof and shall
reasonably endeavor to remedy the situation as soon as possible.

14.  Taxes and Other Payments.

(a) Sales and Use Taxes

ELPOLP agrees that the total  consideration  to be paid for Work  performed
under this Agreement  includes any such sales,  use, gross receipts or like
taxes on materials, supplies, equipment or services furnished by ELPOLP and
on services performed by ELPOLP.  ELPOLP shall obtain the necessary permits
and  licenses to remit  sales,  use,  gross  receipts and like taxes to the
applicable taxing authority. ELPOLP agrees to be responsible for all taxes,
penalties and interest  resulting  from ELPOLP's  failure to properly remit
itemized taxes to the applicable taxing  authority.  Upon written notice to
ELPOLP,  MORGAN may elect to directly  remit sales,  use, gross receipts or
like taxes to the taxing  authority to whom such taxes are due and directly
payable.  If MORGAN  exercises such  election,  MORGAN shall provide ELPOLP
with written evidence, as required by applicable taxing authority, prior to
ELPOLP's procurement or payment of taxable purchases.

all of its  employees  and agents  engaged in the  performance  of the Work
hereunder,  and ELPOLP hereby agrees to be  responsible  for any failure by
ELPOLP or any of its  subcontractors  to pay or withhold taxes,  charges or
compensation due on behalf of its employees or agents involved in the Work.

15.  General  Indemnity.   ELPOLP  AND  MORGAN AGREE  TO INDEMNIFY,  DEFEND  AND

ELPOLP shall, within said thirty (30) day period,
elect to either terminate this Agreement or to
approve MORGAN's assignment of this agreement to the
potential buyer.

26.  General.  The terms and provisions of this Agreement
are intended to supersede any conflicting terms or
conditions in any other agreement between the
parties.  This Agreement contains the entire
agreement between the parties and shall not be
modified or supplemented except by written instrument
duly executed by both parties.  If any provision of
this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held
violative of any applicable law, and so much of said
Agreement is held to be unenforceable, then the
invalidity of such a specific provision herein shall
not be held to invalidate any other provisions
herein, which other provisions shall remain in full
force and effect unless removal of said invalid
provision destroys the legitimate purposes of this
Agreement, in which event this Agreement shall be
canceled.  The terms and provisions of Paragraphs 2,
10, 15, 19, 22, 23 and 27 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.  No waiver of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions
hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided.

27.  Claims.  MORGAN shall assert any and every "Claim" of
any kind or nature whatsoever under this Agreement
("Claim" to include, without limitation, any Claim
relating to, associated with, arising out of or in
any way incidental to the Work or the execution,
inducement to enter into, performance, non-
performance, or breach of this Agreement) exclusively
against ELPOLP and not against any one or more of its
partners nor the general partner, Enron Liquids
Pipeline Company, nor their officers, directors,
employees, or agents nor entities affiliated with it
by common ownership or control, nor any of them
individually or collectively; and MORGAN shall
enforce or attempt to enforce against the assets of
ELPOLP and not against the assets of any partner,
general partner, affiliated entity, nor any of their
officers, directors, employees or agents, except the
general partner's interest in ELPOLP.

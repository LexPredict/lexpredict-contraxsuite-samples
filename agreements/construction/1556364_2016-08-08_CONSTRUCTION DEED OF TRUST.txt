1.01 Payment and Performance of Secured Obligations.  Trustor shall pay when due and/or perform each of the Obligations.





1.02 Maintenance, Repair, Alterations.  Trustor shall keep the Trust Estate in good condition and repair. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Loan Agreement, Trustor shall not remove, demolish, or substantially alter any of the Improvements, except with the prior written consent of Beneficiary.  Trustor shall complete promptly and in a good and workmanlike manner any Improvement that may be now or hereafter constructed on the Premises and promptly restore in like manner any Improvements that may be damaged or destroyed from any cause whatsoever and pay when due all claims for labor performed and materials furnished therefor.  Trustor shall comply with all Requirements (as defined below) and shall not suffer to occur or exist any violation of any Requirement.  Trustor shall not commit or permit any waste or deterioration of the Trust Estate, and, to the extent allowed by law, shall keep and maintain abutting grounds, sidewalks, roads, parking and landscape areas in good and neat order and repair.  Trustor shall perform its obligations under each Lease.  “Requirement” and “Requirements” mean, respectively, each and all obligations and requirements now or hereafter in effect by which Trustor or the Trust Estate are bound or which are otherwise applicable to the Trust Estate, construction of any Improvements on the Trust Estate, or operation, occupancy or use of the Trust Estate (including, without limitation (i) such obligations and requirements imposed by common law or any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or rule (federal, state, or local), and (ii) such obligations and requirements of, in, or in respect of (A) any consent, authorization, license, permit, or approval relating to the Trust Estate, (B) any condition, covenant, restriction, easement, or right-of-way reservation applicable to the Trust Estate, (C) any Lien or Encumbrance (as defined below), (D) any other agreement, document, or instrument to which Trustor is a party or by which Trustor or the Trust Estate is bound or affected, and (E) any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination, or award of any arbitrator, other private adjudicator, court, government, or governmental authority (federal, state, or local) to which Trustor is a party or by which Trustor or the Trust Estate is bound or affected).





1.03 Required Insurance.  Trustor shall at all times provide, maintain and keep in force or cause to be provided, maintained and kept in force with respect to the Trust Estate, at no expense to Trustee or Beneficiary, policies of insurance in forms and amounts and issued by companies reasonably satisfactory to Beneficiary covering such casualties, risks, perils, liabilities and other hazards as is required under the Loan Agreement.  All such policies of insurance required by the terms of this Deed of Trust or the Loan Agreement shall contain an endorsement or agreement by the insurer that any loss shall be payable in accordance with the terms of such policy notwithstanding any act or negligence of Trustor or any party holding under Trustor that might otherwise result in forfeiture of said insurance and the further agreement of the insurer waiving all rights of setoff, counterclaim or deductions against Trustor.













5


















1.04 Delivery of Policies, Payment of Premiums.





(a) At Beneficiary’s option all policies of insurance shall either have attached thereto a lender’s loss payable endorsement for the benefit of Beneficiary in form satisfactory to Beneficiary or shall name Beneficiary as an additional insured.  Trustor shall furnish Beneficiary with certificates of insurance for each required policy setting forth the coverage, the limits of liability, the name of the carrier, the policy number and the period of coverage.  If Beneficiary consents, Trustor may provide any of the required insurance through blanket policies carried by Trustor and covering more than one location, or by policies procured by a tenant or other party holding under Trustor; provided, however, all such policies shall meet the requirements referred to in Section 1.03.  At least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of each required policy, Trustor shall deliver to Beneficiary evidence reasonably satisfactory to Beneficiary of the payment of premium and the renewal or replacement of such policy continuing insurance in form as required by this Deed of Trust.  All such policies shall contain a provision that, notwithstanding any contrary agreement between Trustor and insurance company, such policies will not be canceled, allowed to lapse without renewal, surrendered or materially amended, which term shall include any reduction in the scope or limits of coverage, without at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Beneficiary.





(b) In the event Trustor fails to obtain, maintain, or deliver to Beneficiary the policies of insurance with respect to the Trust Estate required by this Deed of Trust, Beneficiary may, at Beneficiary’s election, but without any obligation so to do, procure such insurance or single-interest insurance for such risks covering Beneficiary’s interest, and Trustor will pay all premiums thereon promptly upon demand by Beneficiary, and until such payment is made by Trustor, the amount of all such premiums shall bear interest at the Agreed Rate.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, if requested by Beneficiary, Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary in monthly installments, an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the estimated aggregate annual insurance premiums on all policies of insurance required by this Deed of Trust (funds deposited for this purpose are referred to as “Insurance Impounds”).  In such event Trustor further agrees to cause all bills, statements, or other documents relating to the foregoing insurance premiums to be sent or mailed directly to Beneficiary.  Upon receipt of such bills, statements, or other documents evidencing that a premium for a required policy is then payable, and provided there are sufficient Insurance Impounds, Beneficiary shall timely pay such amounts as may be due thereunder out of the Insurance Impounds.  If at any time and for any reason the Insurance Impounds are or will be insufficient to pay such amounts as may be then or subsequently due, Beneficiary shall notify Trustor and Trustor shall immediately deposit an amount equal to such deficiency with Beneficiary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall cause Beneficiary to be deemed a trustee of Insurance Impounds or to be obligated to pay any amounts in excess of the amount of the Insurance Impounds, nor shall anything contained herein modify the obligation of Trustor set forth in Section 1.03 to obtain and maintain insurance.  Beneficiary may commingle Insurance Impounds with its own funds, and Trustor shall not be entitled to interest thereon.  Beneficiary may reserve for future payments of premiums such portion of Insurance Impounds as Beneficiary in its absolute and sole discretion deems proper.  If Trustor fails to deposit with Beneficiary sums sufficient to pay fully such premiums at least thirty (30) days before delinquency thereof, Beneficiary may, at Beneficiary’s election, but without any obligation so to do, advance any amounts required to make up the deficiency, which advances, if any, shall be secured hereby and shall be repayable to Beneficiary upon demand with interest from the date advanced at the Agreed Rate, or at the option of Beneficiary the latter may, without making any advance whatever, apply any Insurance Impounds to payment of the Obligations in such order as Beneficiary may determine, notwithstanding that such Obligations may not yet be due.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Beneficiary may, at any time, at Beneficiary’s option, apply any Insurance Impounds or Impositions Impounds under this Section 1.04 or Section 1.08, any funds paid as Rents, and any other funds of Trustor held by Beneficiary to payment of any of the Obligations, in such manner and order as Beneficiary may elect, notwithstanding that such Obligations may not yet be due.













6


















1.05 Casualties; Insurance Proceeds.





(a) Trustor shall give prompt written notice thereof to Beneficiary after the happening of any casualty to or in connection with the Trust Estate or any part thereof, whether or not covered by insurance.  All proceeds of insurance are hereby assigned to Beneficiary, and Trustor hereby authorizes and directs any affected insurance company to make payment of such proceeds directly to Beneficiary.  If Trustor receives any proceeds of insurance resulting from such casualty, Trustor shall promptly pay over such proceeds to Beneficiary.  Except as provided in the Loan Agreement, all proceeds of insurance will be applied by Beneficiary to payment of the Obligations in such order as Beneficiary shall determine.





(b) Trustor shall not be excused from repairing or maintaining the Trust Estate as provided in Section 1.02 hereof or restoring all damage or destruction to the Trust Estate, regardless of whether or not there are insurance proceeds available to Trustor or whether any such proceeds are sufficient in amount, and the application or release by Beneficiary of any insurance proceeds shall not cure or waive any default or notice of default under this Deed of Trust or invalidate any act done pursuant to such default or notice of default.





1.06 Assignment of Policies Upon Foreclosure.  In the event of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust, whether by judicial proceedings or a sale under the power of sale, or any other transfer of title or assignment of the Trust Estate in extinguishment, in whole or in part, of the Obligations, all right, title and interest of Trustor in and to all policies of insurance required by Section 1.03 shall inure to the benefit of and pass to the successor in interest to Trustor or the purchaser or grantee of the Trust Estate, to the extent such policies are assignable pursuant to the terms thereof.













7


















1.07 Indemnification; Subrogation; Waiver of Offset.





(a) If Beneficiary is made a party to any litigation concerning the Note, this Deed of Trust, any of the Loan Documents, the Trust Estate or any part thereof or interest therein, or the occupancy of the Trust Estate by Trustor, then Trustor shall indemnify, defend and hold Beneficiary harmless for, from and against all liability by reason of said litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by Beneficiary as a result of any such litigation, whether or not any such litigation is prosecuted to judgment.  Beneficiary may employ an attorney or attorneys to protect its rights hereunder, and in the event of such employment following any breach by Trustor, Trustor shall pay Beneficiary reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by Beneficiary, whether or not an action is actually commenced against Trustor by reason of its breach.





(b) Trustor waives any and all right to claim or recover against Beneficiary, its successors and assigns, their directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives, for loss of or damage to Trustor, the Trust Estate, Trustor’s property or the property of others under Trustor’s control from any cause insured against or required to be insured against by this Deed of Trust.





(c) All sums payable by Trustor pursuant to this Deed of Trust shall be paid without notice (except for such notice as may be expressly required hereunder or under the other Loan Documents), demand, counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense and without abatement, suspension, deferment, diminution or reduction, and the obligations and liabilities of Trustor hereunder shall in no way be released, discharged or otherwise affected (except as expressly provided herein) by reason of:  (i) any damage to or destruction of or any condemnation or similar taking of the Trust Estate or any part thereof; (ii) any restriction or prevention  of or interference by any Person (as defined below) with any use of the Trust Estate or any part thereof; (iii) any title defect or encumbrance or any eviction from the Premises or the Improvements or any part thereof by title paramount or otherwise; (iv) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like proceeding relating to Beneficiary, or any action taken with respect to this Deed of Trust by any trustee or receiver of Beneficiary, or by any court, in any such proceeding; (v) any claim that Trustor has or might have against Beneficiary; (vi) any default or failure on the part of Beneficiary to perform or comply with any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any other agreement with Trustor; or (vii) any other occurrence whatsoever, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing; whether or not Trustor shall have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing.  Except as expressly provided herein, Trustor waives all rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise to any abatement, suspension, deferment, diminution or reduction of any sum secured hereby and payable by Trustor.  “Person” means any natural person, any unincorporated association, any corporation, any partnership, any limited liability company, any joint venture, any trust, any other legal entity, or any governmental authority (federal, state, local or foreign).













8


















1.08 Impositions.





(a) Trustor shall pay, or cause to be paid, prior to delinquency, all real property taxes and assessments, general and special, and all other taxes and assessments of any kind or nature whatsoever, (including, without limitation, non-governmental levies or assessments such as maintenance charges, levies, or charges resulting from covenants, conditions and restrictions affecting the Trust Estate) that are assessed or imposed upon the Trust Estate or become due and payable and that create, may create, or appear to create a lien upon the Trust Estate (the above are sometimes referred to herein individually as an “Imposition” and collectively as “Impositions”), provided, however, that if by law any Imposition is payable, or may at the option of the taxpayer be paid, in installments, Trustor may pay the same or cause it to be paid, together with any accrued interest on the unpaid balance of such Imposition, in installments as the same becomes due and before any fine, penalty, interest, or cost may be added thereto for the nonpayment of any such installment and interest.





(b) If at any time after the date hereof there shall be assessed or imposed a fee, tax, or assessment on Beneficiary and measured by or based in whole or in part upon this Deed of Trust or the outstanding amount of the Obligations, then all such taxes, assessments or fees shall be deemed to be included within the term “Impositions” as defined in Section 1.08(a) and Trustor shall pay and discharge the same as herein provided with respect to the payment of Impositions.  If Trustor fails to pay such Impositions prior to delinquency, Beneficiary may, at its option, declare all or part of the Obligations, immediately due and payable.  If Trustor is prohibited by law from paying such Impositions, Beneficiary may, at its option, declare all or part of the Obligations due and payable on a date which is not less than six (6) months from the date such prohibition is imposed on Trustor.





(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.08(d) and upon request by Beneficiary, Trustor shall deliver to Beneficiary within thirty (30) days after the date upon which any Imposition is due and payable by Trustor official receipts of the appropriate taxing authority, or other proof satisfactory to Beneficiary, evidencing the payment thereof.





(d) Trustor shall have the right before any delinquency occurs to contest or object to the amount or validity of any Imposition by appropriate proceedings, but this shall not be deemed or construed in any way as relieving, modifying, or extending Trustor’s covenant to pay any such Imposition at the time and in the manner provided in this Section 1.08, unless Trustor has given prior written notice to Beneficiary of Trustor’s intent to so contest or object to an Imposition, and unless, in Beneficiary’s absolute and sole discretion, (i) Trustor shall demonstrate to Beneficiary’s satisfaction that the proceedings to be initiated by Trustor shall conclusively operate to prevent the sale of the Trust Estate or any part thereof or interest therein to satisfy such Imposition prior to final determination of such proceedings, (ii) Trustor shall furnish a good and sufficient bond or surety as requested by and satisfactory to Beneficiary, or (iii) Trustor shall demonstrate to Beneficiary’s satisfaction that Trustor has provided a good and sufficient undertaking as may be required or permitted by law to accomplish a stay of any such sale.













9


















(e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, if requested by Beneficiary, Trustor shall pay to Beneficiary an initial cash deposit in an amount adequate to pay all Impositions for the ensuing tax fiscal year and shall thereafter continue to deposit with Beneficiary, in monthly installments, an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the sum of the annual Impositions reasonably estimated by Beneficiary, for the purpose of paying the installment of Impositions next due (funds deposited for this purpose are referred to as “Impositions Impounds”).  In such event, Trustor further agrees to cause all bills, statements, or other documents relating to Impositions to be sent or mailed directly to Beneficiary.  Upon receipt of such bills, statements, or other documents, and providing there are sufficient Impositions Impounds, Beneficiary shall timely pay such amounts as may be due thereunder out of the Impositions Impounds.  If at any time and for any reason the Impositions Impounds are or will be insufficient to pay such amounts as may then or subsequently be due, Beneficiary may notify Trustor and upon such notice Trustor shall deposit immediately an amount equal to such deficiency with Beneficiary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall cause Beneficiary to be deemed a trustee of Impositions Impounds or to be obligated to pay any amounts in excess of the amount of funds deposited with Beneficiary pursuant to this Section 1.08(e).  Beneficiary may commingle Impositions Impounds with its own funds and shall not be obligated to pay any interest on any Impositions Impounds.  Beneficiary may reserve for future payment of Impositions such portion of Impositions Impounds as Beneficiary may in its absolute and sole discretion deem proper.  If Trustor fails to deposit with Beneficiary sums sufficient to fully pay such Impositions at least thirty (30) days before delinquency thereof, Beneficiary may, at Beneficiary’s election, but without any obligation so to do, advance any amounts required to make up the deficiency, which advances, if any, shall be secured hereby and shall be repayable to Beneficiary upon demand together with interest thereon at the Agreed Rate from the date of such advance, or at the option of Beneficiary the latter may, without making any advance whatever, apply any Impositions Impounds held by it upon any of the Obligations in such order as Beneficiary may determine, notwithstanding that such Obligations may not yet be due.





(f) Trustor shall not initiate or suffer to occur or exist the joint assessment of any real and personal property included in the Trust Estate or any other procedure whereby the lien of real property taxes and the lien of personal property taxes shall be assessed, levied, or charged to the Trust Estate as a single lien.





1.09 Utilities.  Trustor shall pay when due all charges that are incurred by Trustor for the benefit of the Trust Estate or that may become a charge or lien against the Trust Estate for gas, electricity, water, sewer, or other services furnished to the Trust Estate.





1.10 Actions Affecting Trust Estate.  Trustor shall appear in and contest any action or proceeding purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of Beneficiary or Trustee; and shall pay all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, costs of evidence of title, litigation, and attorneys’ fees) in any such action or proceeding in which Beneficiary or Trustee may appear.





1.11 Actions By Trustee or Beneficiary.  If Trustor fails to make any payment or to do any act as and in the manner provided in any of the Loan Documents, Beneficiary and/or Trustee, each in its absolute and sole discretion, without obligation so to do, without releasing Trustor from any obligation, and with only such notice to or demand upon Trustor as may be reasonable under the then existing circumstances, but in no event exceeding ten (10) days prior written notice, may make or do the same in such manner and to such extent as either may deem necessary or appropriate.  In connection therewith (without limiting their general powers, whether conferred herein, in another Loan Document or by law), Beneficiary and Trustee shall have and are hereby given the right, but not the obligation, (a) to enter upon and take possession of the Trust Estate; (b) to make additions, alterations, repairs and improvements to the Trust Estate that they or either of them may consider necessary or appropriate to keep the Trust Estate in good condition and repair; (c) to appear and participate in any action or proceeding affecting or which may affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of Beneficiary or Trustee; (d) to pay, purchase, contest or compromise any Lien or Encumbrance (as defined below) or alleged Lien or Encumbrance whether superior or junior to this Deed of Trust; and (e) in exercising such powers, to pay necessary expenses (including, without limitation, expenses of employment of counsel or other necessary or desirable consultants).  Trustor shall, immediately upon demand therefor by Beneficiary and Trustee or either of them, pay to Beneficiary and Trustee an amount equal to all respective costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with the exercise by either Beneficiary or Trustee or both of the foregoing rights (including, without limitation, costs of evidence of title, court costs, appraisals, surveys and receiver’s, trustee’s and attorneys’ fees) together with interest thereon from the date of such expenditures at the Agreed Rate.













10


















1.12 Transfer of Trust Estate by Trustor.  In order to induce Beneficiary to make the Loan, Trustor agrees that, in the event of any Transfer (as hereinafter defined), without the prior written consent of Beneficiary, Beneficiary shall have the absolute right, at its option, without prior demand or notice, to declare all sums secured hereby immediately due and payable.  Consent to one such transaction shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to require consent to future or successive transactions.  Beneficiary may grant or deny such consent in its sole discretion and, if consent should be given, any such Transfer shall be subject to this Deed of Trust, and such transferee shall assume all obligations hereunder and agree to be bound by all provisions contained herein.  Such assumption shall not, however, release Trustor or any maker or guarantor (if any) of the Note from any liability thereunder without the prior written consent of Beneficiary.  As used herein, “Transfer” shall mean:





(i) any sale, transfer, conveyance, pledge, hypothecation, assignment, mortgage, grant of security interest in, encumbrance, lease or vesting of the Trust Estate or any part thereof or interest therein to or in any Person, whether voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law, or otherwise, except the Permitted Exceptions (as such term is defined in Exhibit C attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference);





(ii) any sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, hypothecation, encumbrance or vesting of any beneficial interest in Trustor or any beneficiary, partner, member, or shareholder in Trustor to or in any Person (if Trustor or any partner, member or shareholder in Trustor is a trust) whether voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law, or otherwise, except the Permitted Exceptions;





(iii) any sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, hypothecation, encumbrance or vesting of any general partnership interest in Trustor or any beneficiary, partner, member, or shareholder in Trustor to or in any Person (if Trustor or any beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder in Trustor is a partnership) whether voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law, or otherwise, except the Permitted Exceptions;

(v) any sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, hypothecation, encumbrance or vesting of any shares of stock in Trustor or any beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder in Trustor to or in any Person or any consolidation or merger of Trustor or any beneficiary, partner, member, or shareholder in Trustor into or with any Person (if Trustor or any beneficiary, partner, member, or shareholder in Trustor is a corporation) whether voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law, or otherwise, except the Permitted Exceptions;





(vi) any sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, hypothecation, encumbrance or vesting of any other legal or beneficial interest in Trustor or any beneficiary, partner, member, or shareholder in Trustor whether voluntary, involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except the Permitted Exceptions; or

(a) In the event that any proceeding or action be commenced for the taking of the Trust Estate, or any part thereof or interest therein, for public or quasi-public use under the power of eminent domain, condemnation (including, without limitation, inverse condemnation) or otherwise (hereinafter collectively referred to as a “Taking”), or if the same be taken or damaged by reason of any public improvement or Taking, or should Trustor receive any notice or other information regarding such Taking or damage, Trustor shall give prompt written notice thereof to Beneficiary.  All compensation, awards, damages, rights of action and proceeds awarded to Trustor by reason of any such Taking or damage or received by Trustor as the result of a transfer in lieu of a Taking (the “Condemnation Proceeds”) are hereby assigned to Beneficiary, and Trustor agrees to execute such further assignments of the Condemnation Proceeds as Beneficiary or Trustee may require.  If Trustor receives any Condemnation Proceeds, Trustor shall promptly pay over such proceeds to Beneficiary.  All Condemnation Proceeds will be applied by Beneficiary to payment of the Obligations in such order as Beneficiary shall determine. Beneficiary is hereby authorized and empowered by Trustor, at Beneficiary’s option and in Beneficiary’s sole discretion, as attorney-in-fact for Trustor, to settle, adjust, or compromise any claim for loss or damage in connection with any Taking or proposed Taking and, without regard to the adequacy of its security, to commence, appear in and prosecute in its own name and/or on behalf of Trustor any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to a Taking or proposed Taking.













12


















(b) Trustor shall not be excused from repairing or maintaining the Trust Estate as provided in Section 1.02 or restoring all damage or destruction to the Trust Estate, regardless of whether or not there are Condemnation Proceeds available to Trustor or whether any such Condemnation Proceeds are sufficient in amount.  The application or release of the Condemnation Proceeds shall not cure or waive any default or notice of default hereunder or under any other Loan Document or invalidate any act done pursuant to such default or notice of default.





1.14 Additional Security.  No other security now existing, or hereafter taken, to secure the obligations secured hereby shall be impaired or affected by the execution of this Deed of Trust.  All security for the Obligations from time to time shall be taken, considered and held as cumulative.  Any taking of additional security, execution of partial releases of the security, or any extension of the time of payment of, or modification of other terms of any of the Obligations shall not diminish the force, effect or lien of this Deed of Trust and shall not affect or impair the liability of any maker, guarantor, surety or endorser for the payment or performance of any of the Obligations.  In the event Beneficiary at any time holds additional security for any of the Obligations, it may enforce the sale thereof or otherwise realize upon the same, at its option, either before, concurrently with, or after a sale or realization is made hereunder.





1.15 Appointment of Successor Trustee.  Beneficiary may, from time to time, by a written instrument executed and acknowledged by Beneficiary, mailed to Trustor and recorded in the county in which the Trust Estate is located and by otherwise complying with the provisions of applicable law, substitute a successor or successors to any Trustee named herein or acting hereunder, and such successor(s) shall, without conveyance from the Trustee predecessor, succeed to all title, estate, rights, powers and duties of such predecessor.





1.16 Inspections.  Beneficiary, and its agents, representatives officers, and employees, are authorized to enter at any reasonable time upon or in any part of the Trust Estate for the purpose of inspecting the same and for the purpose of performing any of the acts Beneficiary is authorized to perform hereunder or under the terms of any of the Loan Documents.





1.17 Ownership and Liens and Encumbrances.  Trustor is, and as to any portion of the Trust Estate acquired hereafter will upon such acquisitions be, and shall remain the owner of the Trust Estate free and clear of any Liens and Encumbrances.  Trustor shall not grant, shall not suffer to exist, and shall pay and promptly discharge, at Trustor’s cost and expense, all Liens and Encumbrances and any claims thereof upon the Trust Estate, or any part thereof or interest therein.  Trustor shall notify Beneficiary immediately in writing of any Lien or Encumbrance or claim thereof.  Trustor shall have the right to contest in good faith the validity of any involuntary Lien or Encumbrance, provided Trustor shall first deposit with Beneficiary a bond or other security satisfactory to Beneficiary in such amount as Beneficiary shall reasonably require, but not more than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the amount of the claim, and provided further that if Trustor loses such contest, Trustor shall thereafter diligently proceed to cause such Lien or Encumbrance to be removed and discharged.  If Trustor shall fail to remove and discharge any Lien or Encumbrance or claim thereof, then, in addition to any other right or remedy of Beneficiary, Beneficiary may, after only such notice to Trustor as may be reasonable under the then existing circumstances, but shall not be obligated to, discharge the same, either by paying the amount claimed to be due, or by procuring the discharge of such Lien or Encumbrance by depositing in a court a bond or the amount claimed or otherwise giving security for such claim, or by procuring such discharge in such manner as is or may be prescribed by law.  Trustor shall, immediately upon demand therefor by Beneficiary, pay to Beneficiary an amount equal to all costs and expenses incurred by Beneficiary in connection with the exercise by Beneficiary of the foregoing right to discharge any Lien or Encumbrance or claim thereof, together with interest thereon from the date of each such expenditure at the Agreed Rate.  Such costs and expenses shall be secured by this Deed of Trust.  “Lien or Encumbrance” and “Liens and Encumbrances” mean, respectively, each and all of the following in respect of the Trust Estate:  leases, other rights to occupy or use, mortgages, deeds of trust, pledges, security agreements, assignments, assignments as security, conditional sales, title retention arrangements or agreements, conditions, covenants, and restrictions, and other charges, liens, encumbrances, or adverse interests, whether voluntarily or involuntarily created and regardless of whether prior or subordinate to any estate, right, title, or interest granted to Trustee or Beneficiary in this Deed of Trust, excluding from the foregoing the Permitted Exceptions.













13


















1.18 Trustee’s Powers.  At any time, or from time to time, without liability therefor and without notice, upon written request of Beneficiary and presentation of this Deed of Trust and without affecting the personal liability of any person for payment of the Obligations or the effect of this Deed of Trust upon the remainder of said Trust Estate, Trustee may (a) reconvey any part of said Trust Estate, (b) consent in writing to the making of any map or plat thereof, (c) join in granting any easement thereon, or (d) join in any extension agreement or any agreement subordinating the lien or charge hereof.





1.19 Beneficiary’s Powers.  Without affecting the liability of any Person liable for the payment of the Obligations herein mentioned, and without affecting the lien or charge of this Deed of Trust upon any portion of the Trust Estate not then or theretofore released as security for the Obligations, Beneficiary may, from time to time and without notice (a) release any person so liable, (b) extend the Obligations, (c) grant other indulgences, (d) release or reconvey, or cause to be released or reconveyed, at any time at Beneficiary’s option any parcel, portion or all of the Trust Estate, (e) take or release any other or additional security or any guaranty for any Obligation herein mentioned, or (f) make compositions or other arrangements with debtors in relation thereto.





1.20 Financial Statements.  Trustor shall deliver to Beneficiary such financial statements , balance sheets, profit and loss statements, operating statements, income and expense statements and other financial information in such detail and at the times required by the Loan Agreement.  All such statements shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Loan Agreement.  Beneficiary shall have the right to audit, inspect and copy all of Trustor’s books and records, relating thereto.





1.21 Trade Names.   At the request of Beneficiary from time to time, Trustor shall execute a certificate in form satisfactory to Beneficiary listing the trade names or fictitious business names under which Trustor intends to operate the Trust Estate or any business located thereon and representing and warranting that Trustor does business under no other trade names or fictitious business names with respect to the Trust Estate.  Trustor shall immediately notify Beneficiary in writing of any change in said trade names or fictitious business names, and will, upon request of Beneficiary, authorize any additional financing statements and execute any other certificates necessary to reflect the change in trade names or fictitious business names.













14


















1.22 Leasehold.  If a leasehold estate constitutes a portion of the Trust Estate, Trustor agrees not to amend, modify, extend, renew or terminate such leasehold estate, any interest therein, or the lease granting such leasehold estate without the prior written consent of Beneficiary, which consent may be withheld by Beneficiary in its absolute and sole discretion.  Consent to one amendment, modification, extension or renewal shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to require consent to other, future or successive amendments, modifications, extensions or renewals.  Trustor agrees to perform all obligations and agreements under said leasehold and shall not take any action or omit to take any action which would effect or permit the termination of said leasehold.  Trustor agrees to promptly notify Beneficiary in writing with respect to any default or alleged default by any party thereto and to deliver to Beneficiary copies of all notices, demands, complaints or other communications received or given by Trustor with respect to any such default or alleged default.  Beneficiary shall have the option to cure any such default and to perform any or all of Trustor’s obligations thereunder.  All sums expended by Beneficiary in curing any such default shall be secured hereby and shall be immediately due and payable without demand or notice and shall bear interest from date of expenditure at the Agreed Rate.





ARTICLE II





ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS





2.01 Assignment of Rents.  Trustor hereby absolutely and irrevocably assigns and transfers to Beneficiary all the Rents of the Trust Estate, and hereby gives to and confers upon Beneficiary the right, power and authority to collect the Rents.  Trustor irrevocably appoints Beneficiary its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, at the option of Beneficiary at any time and from time to time, to demand, receive and enforce payment, to give receipts, releases and satisfactions, and to sue, in the name of Trustor or Beneficiary, for all Rents and apply the same to the payment of the Obligations in such order as Beneficiary shall determine.  Trustor hereby authorizes and directs the lessees, tenants and occupants to make all payments under the Leases directly to Beneficiary upon written demand by Beneficiary, without further consent of Trustor; provided, however, that Trustor shall have the right to collect such Rents (but not more than one (1) month in advance unless the written approval of Beneficiary is first obtained), and to retain, distribute and enjoy same, so long as an Event of Default shall not have occurred hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.  The assignment of the Rents of the Trust Estate in this Article II is intended to be an absolute and unconditional present assignment from Trustor to Beneficiary and not merely the passing of a security interest. Beneficiary’s rights to the Rents are not contingent upon and may be exercised without possession of the Trust Estate.





2.02 Collection Upon an Event of Default.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Beneficiary may, at any time without notice, either in person, by agent or by a receiver appointed by a court, and without regard to the adequacy of any security for the Obligations, enter upon and take possession of the Trust Estate, or any part thereof, and, with or without such entry or taking possession, in its own name sue for or otherwise collect the Rents (including, without limitation, those past due and unpaid) and apply the same, less costs and expenses of operation and collection (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) upon payment of the Obligations in such order as Beneficiary may determine.  The collection of such Rents, or the entering upon and taking possession of the Trust Estate, or the application of the Rents as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any default or notice of default hereunder or invalidate any act done in response to such default or pursuant to such notice of default.  Trustor also hereby authorizes Beneficiary upon such entry, at its option, to take over and assume the management, operation and maintenance of the Trust Estate and to perform all acts Beneficiary in its sole discretion deems necessary and proper and to expend such sums out of Rents as may be needed in connection therewith, in the same manner and to the same extent as Trustor theretofore could do (including, without limitation, the right to enter into new leases, to cancel, surrender, alter or amend the terms of, and/or renew existing leases (collectively, the “Leases,”) and/or to make concessions to tenants).  Trustor hereby releases all claims of any kind or nature against Beneficiary arising out of such management, operation and maintenance, excepting the liability of Beneficiary to account as hereinafter set forth.













15


















2.03 Application of Rents.  Upon such entry, Beneficiary shall, after payment of all property charges and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable compensation to such managing agent as it may select and employ) and after the accumulation of a reserve to meet requisite amounts, credit the net amount of the Rents received by it to the Obligations, but the manner of the application of such net income and which items shall be credited shall be determined in the sole discretion of Beneficiary.  Beneficiary shall not be accountable for more monies than it actually receives from the Trust Estate; nor shall it be liable for failure to collect Rents.  Beneficiary shall make reasonable efforts to collect Rents, reserving, however, within its own absolute and sole discretion, the right to determine the method of collection and the extent to which enforcement of collection of Rents shall be prosecuted and Beneficiary’s judgment shall be deemed conclusive and reasonable.





2.04 Mortgagee in Possession.  It is not the intention of the parties hereto that an entry by Beneficiary upon the Premises under the terms of this instrument shall make Beneficiary a party in possession in contemplation of the law, except at the option of Beneficiary.





2.05 Indemnity.  Trustor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Beneficiary for, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, demands, damages, penalties, judgments, costs, and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, howsoever and by whomsoever asserted, arising out of or in any way connected with this assignment; and all such losses, liabilities, obligations, claims, demands, damages, penalties, judgments, costs and expenses shall be deemed added to the indebtedness secured hereby and shall be secured by any and all other instruments securing said indebtedness.





2.06 No Obligation to Perform.  Nothing contained herein shall operate or be construed to obligate Beneficiary to perform any obligations of Trustor under any Lease (including, without limitation, any obligation arising out of any covenant of quiet enjoyment therein contained in the event the lessee under any such Lease shall have been joined as a party defendant in any action to foreclose and the estate of such lessee shall have been thereby terminated).  Prior to actual entry into and taking possession of the Premises by Beneficiary, this assignment shall not operate to place upon Beneficiary any responsibility for the operation, control, care, management or repair of the Trust Estate or any portion thereof, and the execution of this assignment by Trustor shall constitute conclusive evidence that all responsibility for the operation, control, care, management and repair of the Trust Estate is and shall be that of Trustor, prior to such actual entry and taking of possession.













16

17


















(g) Trustor will not change its name or the type of legal entity that it is without Beneficiary’s prior written consent.

(i) Trustor shall immediately notify Beneficiary of any claim against the Personal Property adverse to the interest of Beneficiary therein.





3.03 Use of Personal Property by Trustor.  Until the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder or under any other Loan Document, Trustor may have possession of the Personal Property and use it in any lawful manner not inconsistent with this Deed of Trust and not inconsistent with any policy of insurance thereon.

(ii) Without notice to or demand upon Trustor, make such payments and do such acts as Beneficiary may deem necessary to protect its security interest in the Personal Property (including, without limitation, paying, purchasing, contesting or compromising any Lien or Encumbrance, whether superior or inferior to such security interest) and in exercising any such powers or authority to pay all expenses (including, without limitation, litigation costs and reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred in connection therewith;





(iii) Require Trustor from time to time to assemble the Personal Property, or any portion thereof, at a place designated by Beneficiary and reasonably convenient to both parties, and deliver promptly such Personal Property to Beneficiary, or an agent or representative designated by Beneficiary.  Beneficiary, and its agents and representatives, shall have the right to enter upon any or all of Trustor’s premises and property to exercise Beneficiary’s rights hereunder;













18


















(iv) Realize upon the Personal Property or any part thereof as herein provided or in any manner permitted by law and exercise any and all of the other rights and remedies conferred upon Beneficiary by this Deed of Trust, any other Loan Document, or by law, either concurrently or in such order as Beneficiary may determine;

If Beneficiary fails to comply with this Section 3.04 in any respect, its liability for such failure shall be limited to the liability (if any) imposed on it as a matter of law under the California Commercial Code (or under the Uniform Commercial Code, enforced from time to time, in any other state to the extent the same is the applicable law)

3.07 Authorization to File Financing Statements; Power of Attorney.  Trustor hereby authorizes Beneficiary at any time and from time to time to file any initial financing statements, amendments thereto, and continuation statements with or without signature of Trustor as authorized by applicable law, as applicable to the Trust Estate.  For purposes of such filing, Trustor agrees to furnish any information requested by Beneficiary promptly upon request by Beneficiary.  Trustor also ratifies its authorization for Beneficiary to have filed any like initial financing statements, amendments thereto, or continuation statements if filed prior to the date of this Deed of Trust.  Trustor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Beneficiary and any officer or agent of Beneficiary, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorneys-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in the place and stead of Trustor or in Trustor's own name to execute in Trustor's name any such documents and to otherwise carry out the purposes of this Section 3.07, to the extent that Trustor's authorization above is not sufficient.  To the extent permitted by law, Trustor hereby ratifies and affirms all acts said attorneys-in-fact shall lawfully do, have done in the past, or caused to be done in the future by virtue hereof.  This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.

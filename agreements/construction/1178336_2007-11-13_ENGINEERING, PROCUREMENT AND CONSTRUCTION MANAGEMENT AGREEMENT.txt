payment (the “Application for Payment”). The period covered by each Application for Payment shall be one calendar month ending on the last day of the month or as otherwise mutually agreed to accommodate Contractor’s cost
system as it is understood that Contractor’s labor costs are accumulated such that a pay period must end on a Sunday. Contractor will provide with each Application for Payment a projection estimate for the anticipated costs of the Work during
the upcoming month. This projected estimate of costs plus the Contractor’s Fee of [*] on all estimated costs, less the retainage stipulated in Section 10.1.1.1, shall serve as the basis of Contractor’s payment for that month. Within

documentation for such reimbursable costs as required herein. Contractor will then prepare, contemporaneous with the next month’s Application for Payment, a monthly reconciliation of the reimbursable costs that compares the advance funding
received from the Owner against the actual summary of costs for the applicable period. Should the reconciliation show a deficiency in funding, the then current monthly Application for Payment will include the amount necessary to fully reimburse
Contractor for any such deficiency plus the any proportionate Fee deficiency.

Applications for Payment.
Reimbursements of the Cost of the Work shall not be construed as Owner’s approval or acceptance of the Work. If disputed
charges are identified at the time of original invoicing or during an audit of invoiced charges, payment for the disputed items may be withheld subject to resolution and subject to the interest provisions of Section 10.1.4. A resolution of
disputed charges will be attempted through negotiation between the Party representatives identified in Article 15.9, which negotiation shall occur within 15 calendar days of the Contractor’s receipt of the notice of any disputed charges. If the
Party representatives are unable to resolve the dispute, either Party may submit the dispute for resolution in accordance with Article 13.
Provided that an Application for Payment is received by the Owner not later than the 1st day of a month, the Owner shall make payment to the Contractor not later than the 15th
day of the same month. If an Application for Payment is received by the Owner after the application date fixed above, payment shall be made by the Owner not later than fifteen (15) days after the date it receives the Application for Payment.

With each Application for Payment, the Contractor shall submit partial release of liens, payroll information documenting actual hours worked
with applicable rates, petty cash accounts, receipted invoices or invoices with check vouchers attached and any other evidence reasonably required by the Owner to support Contractor’s previous Applications for Payment and to demonstrate the
cash disbursements already made by the Contractor on account of the cost of the Work.
Applications for Payment shall show the Cost of the Work that
Contractor estimates that it will expend or incur through the end of the period covered by the Application for Payment and for which the Contractor has made or intends to make actual payment prior to the next Application for Payment plus the
Contractor’s Fee of [*] on all such estimated costs, less the retainage stipulated in Section 10.1.1.1.
The amount of retainage with respect to
progress payments, which will be reflected on the Application for Payment, will be:

fees, soil tests, construction testing, dumpsters, and miscellaneous direct third party costs;
10.1.1.2. [*] retainage on
the Work until Substantial Completion. The Owner shall release and pay Contractor all amounts retained from the Applications for Payment within thirty (30) days of Contractor’s achievement of Substantial Completion.
10.1.2. FAILURE TO MAKE PAYMENT. If Owner should fail to pay Contractor at the time the payment of any amount becomes due, Contractor may,
at its option, upon giving written notice that it will stop Work within ten (10) days after receipt of the notice by Owner, and after such ten (10) day period, stop the Work until payment of the amount owing has been received.

10.1.3. INTEREST. Payments due but unpaid shall bear interest at a rate equal to the [*] per month until paid.

respect to any similar contract between Owner and any other contractor entered into before the date of this Agreement, Owner shall use reasonable efforts to cause any such contract to be amended to provide the aforementioned indemnity to Owner and
Contractor.
11.1.3. APPLICATION OF INDEMNITIES. Owner and Contractor intend that the indemnity obligations set forth in
Articles 11.1.1 and 11.1.2 above shall apply even if a claim or loss arises in whole or in part from the negligence, strict liability, statutory liability, or other wrongful act or omission of the indemnified party. In such event the indemnifying
party’s obligation shall be reduced in proportion to the indemnified party’s contributing negligence or fault.

5.0	PURCHASING



5.1	GENERAL



5.1.1 	CONFIDENTIALITY OF PRICES

SS&W will require
confidentiality of supplier pricing and documentation be maintained at all times. Dissemination of Supplier’s price offerings, purchase order, pricing or ranking to individuals without a need to know is contrary to SS&W policies and
procedures. Supplier information will be controlled to insure that no prospective source of supply is afforded an unfair advantage over other suppliers.
Absolutely no information regarding supplier pricing shall be made available to anyone other than those who have a “need to know”.


5.1.2	INITIAL CONTACTS WITH SUPPLIERS

All initial contacts with
Suppliers shall be made through the Purchasing staff. If further discussions with members of another discipline are required, and if commercial aspects are to be discussed, Procurement will participate in the discussions.


5.1.3	TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH SUPPLIERS

Engineering
personnel may discuss preliminary technical information or technical aspects of a material requirement with a prospective bidder or potential supplier. However, it is the responsibility of the engineer to inform the PPM and Engineering Manager of
the discussion and instruct the Supplier to send any pertinent correspondence directly to the appropriate purchasing representative on this project.
Note: Engineering personnel are not authorized to solicit quotations from prospective bidders or suppliers to make commercial commitments on behalf of SS&W or Hoku Materials.
After placement of the Purchase Order, contacts of a technical nature that do not impact either cost or delivery may be made with a supplier by
Engineering personnel. However, a copy of all pertinent correspondence and notes must be provided to the PPM and Engineering Manager.


5.1.4	PREPARATION OF PROJECT REQUISITIONS

Each requirement for
inquiry or purchase must be initiated by Engineering by the preparation, review, approval, and transmittal of an Inquiry Requisition or Purchase Requisition utilizing SS&W’s corporate procurement procedures. After approval by the

If it becomes
necessary to make changes to the technical or commercial requirements of the Inquiry, once issued, under the formal solicitation method, such changes shall be documented in the form of a formal written Amendment and sent to all active Bidders. Its
receipt must be acknowledged within the Bidder’s proposal.
The type and number of Bidders will be determined by the budget value of
the requisition. The following table details the requirements:


5.4.2	Informal Solicitation Method

The informal solicitation
method may be used for purchases having an aggregate value of less than $50,000 where there is no cost advantage to offset the internal administrative costs associated with competitive bidding. The informal process will not require sealed bids and
will allow for submittal by various methods including fax and email.


5.5	RECEIPT, OPENING, AND TRANSMITTAL OF PROPOSALS

Should
Engineering be required to review proposals and prepare a Technical Comparison of Bids, copies of the proposals received will be transmitted to the Requisitioning Engineer as soon as practicable after bid opening.


5.6	SS&W SELECTION



5.6.1	Bid Evaluation and Purchase Recommendation

After receipt
of proposals, the responsible engineer and Hoku Materials will jointly review the bids received and select the bidder(s) with the most competitive proposal(s) to be further considered for evaluation and award. Discussions with other than the most
competitively ranked bidder(s) will be pursued only in the event of unsatisfactory responses obtained during proposal clarification.
No
information will be provided to any Bidder with respect to its relative ranking or status during the proposal clarification period.
Procurement shall, when appropriate, prepare the Commercial Comparison of Bids and Engineering, when appropriate, shall prepare a Technical Comparison of Bids. Procurement shall coordinate the timely completion of the combined bid
comparison to support a final recommendation for award. In cases where the procurement is made on a sole source basis, a recommendation memo incorporating commercial and technical justification shall be prepared and signed-off by the PPM,
Engineering Manager and the Project Manager.

The name of the recommended Supplier, the total purchase price and the basis for recommendation shall be entered in the space designated on the Commercial
Comparison of Bids. The Supplier selected must always be technically acceptable and generally, have offered the most competitive commercial proposal which meets the quality, price, and delivery requirements of the project. The Commercial and
Technical Comparison of Bids will then been forwarded to Hoku Materials for signature approval.
Upon approval of the recommended supplier,
the requisitioning engineer will initiate a Purchase Requisition and begin preparation of the conformed specification when applicable. Once complete, the engineer shall transmit a sufficient number of conformed specifications and drawings to support
the complete Purchase Order distribution to Procurement.


5.7	PURCHASE COMMITMENTS



5.7.1	NOTIFICATION OF COMMITMENT

After the required approval
for purchase has been received, Hoku Materials or SS&W acting as agent for Hoku Materials will issue a purchase commitment to the selected supplier in the form of a hard copy Purchase Order or Letter of Award (LOA), and, as appropriate, notify
the unsuccessful bidders.
Purchase commitments made by a LOA will be confirmed by the issuance of a formal Purchase Order incorporating all
the applicable terms and conditions, documentation, and specifications, as soon as practicable thereafter. If the conformed specification is expected to take more than ten (10) days to prepare, the PPM, with the Project Manager’s approval,
may elect to issue the Purchase Order without the conformed specification. In these instances, the Inquiry specification shall be referenced in the Purchase Order and the following words shall be included: “a conformed specification,
incorporating all agreed to technical conditions and technical requirements will be issued shortly via Purchase Order Revision”. Once ready, the conformed specification will be issued via a Purchase Order Revision.


5.7.2	PURCHASE ORDERS

Confirmation of all purchase awards will
be made through the issuance of a formal Purchase Order document incorporating therein the appropriate procurement documents and technical specification, standards, agreements, etc., as agreed by Hoku Materials or SS&W acting as agent for Hoku
Materials and the successful Supplier.

Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in the Agreement.
As an incentive for Contractor to perform to meet the tight
construction schedule, and to minimize cost to Owner, Contractor shall be paid the following fees, which are in addition to those outlined in Exhibit D.
Total Cost Incentive
The total installed cost (TIC) target for Owner to complete the Project is $260 million. The TIC shall include all costs
incurred by Owner in the construction of the Project including procured material and equipment and cost of other contractors performing work on the Project, and all fees, costs and expenses incurred in accordance with Contractor’s Work pursuant
to Sections 1 and 2 of Exhibit D, all of Contractor’s Work, and all incentive payments that may be paid to Contractor pursuant to this Addendum 1. The TIC shall specifically exclude “soft costs” incurred by Owner, which shall include,
but not be limited to, interest expense, loan fees, legal fees, and labor costs incurred by Owner. The TIC and Target Price shall be adjusted pursuant to ARTICLE 6.3 and ARTICLE 8 of the Agreement for any approved Change Orders plus the following:



•	 	 Increase in foreign exchange costs that actually increase the TIC or Target Price of the Project




•	 	 All taxes, duties, or other Government imposts not reasonably foreseeable that actually increase the TIC or Target Price of the Project





•	 	 All increases in transportation costs that are not reasonably foreseeable and that actually increase the TIC or Target Price of the Project





•	 	 All increases in costs of insurance for the Project that are not reasonably foreseeable and actually increase the TIC or Target Price of the Project





•	 	 All costs or delays which results from an event of Force Majeure or Owner acts and omissions




•	 	 Any increases in equipment costs above the original budget




•	 	 The cost of theft and/or vandalism not recoverable from insurance and not due to the negligent or reckless acts of Contractor, or Contractor’s failure to
secure and protect the Project from theft and vandalism


In the event Owner’s TIC is less than the target TIC, as adjusted herein,
Contractor shall be entitled to a Cost Incentive equal [*] of the savings, up to a maximum incentive to Contractor of [*].
In the event that the cost of
Contractor’s Work is less than $41,500,000 (“Target Price”), Contractor shall be entitled to an additional Cost Incentive equal to [*] of the savings, up to a maximum incentive of [*].
Schedule Incentive
Based upon equipment lead time, construction and
permitting, the date for Substantial Completion (as defined in the Agreement) is May 31, 2009 (the “Substantial Completion Date”). However, it is Owner’s desire to achieve the Preliminary Reactor Installation (as
defined on Exhibit B to the Agreement) by October 31, 2008 (the “Preliminary Reactor Installation Date”), the Mechanical Completion (as defined

on Exhibit B to the Agreement) by January 31, 2009 (the “Mechanical Completion Date”). In the event the
Preliminary Reactor Installation, the Mechanical Completion or the Substantial Completion shall occur on or before the respective dates set forth above, Contractor shall be entitled to a “Schedule Incentive” equal to [*] for each such
milestone. However, after the date of each such completion date, the applicable Schedule Incentive shall be reduced by [*] per day for every day the Preliminary Reactor Installation, the Mechanical Completion or the Substantial Completion, as
applicable, is not achieved. However, in no event shall the Schedule Incentive be reduced below zero. The scheduled completion dates outlined above shall be adjusted pursuant to ARTICLE 6.3 of the Agreement and pursuant to ARTICLE 8 of the Agreement
for any approved Change Orders
It is understood by both Parties that the TIC, Target Prcie, and Schedule Incentives outlined above are only intended to
provide an incentive for Contractor to put forth extra efforts to minimize Project costs and meet the Contract Time Schedule. In no event, however, does Contractor represent or warrant to Owner that the TIC, Target Price, or the Contract Time
Schedule will be achieved, and Contractor shall be paid for the Work pursuant to the Agreement regardless of the actual results of the TIC, Target Price, and/or Contract Time Schedule.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Consent and Agreements.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Consent, the Contracting Party acknowledges and consents to the assignment as collateral security to the Agent, for the
benefit of the Secured Parties, of the Assigned Interests. The Contracting Party further acknowledges the right of Agent or any designee of Agent, in exercise of Agent’s rights and remedies as a secured creditor of Borrower, to make all
demands, give all notices, take all actions and exercise all rights of Borrower under the Contract.
(b) The Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated) to
cure any defaults of the Borrower under the Contract in accordance with the provisions hereof. Upon receipt by the Contracting Party of written notice from the Agent, the Contracting Party agrees to (i) accept such cure by the Agent and,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Contract and cure of such defaults, to render to the Secured Parties all performance due by it under the Contract and this Consent, and (ii) act solely on the instructions of the Agent, not the
Borrower, with respect to the exercise of the Borrower’s rights under the relevant Contract. The Contracting Party agrees to make all payments to be made by it under the Contract directly to the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties upon
receipt of the Agent’s written instructions to do so and any such payments made to the Agent by the Contracting Party shall be deemed to have been made by the Contracting Party in fulfillment of the Contracting Party’s obligations to the
Borrower under the Contract.
(c) In all cases except as provided in the Contract or required by law, and in accordance with Section 1(e) hereof, the
Contracting Party will not, without the prior written consent of the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), (i) cancel or terminate the Contract or suspend performance of its services thereunder, or consent to or accept any
cancellation, termination or suspension thereof by the Borrower, (ii) amend the Contract [NOTE: Exceptions will be limited to Change Orders otherwise permitted under the Agreement], or (iii) sell, assign or otherwise dispose (by operation
of law or otherwise) of any part of its rights, title or interest in the Contract. The Borrower agrees to deliver copies of all notices of default, notices of the suspension of performance by Contracting Party, notices of force majeure or requests
for change orders delivered by Contracting Party to Borrower under or pursuant to the Contract to the Agent promptly upon delivery thereof.
(d) The
Contracting Party will not terminate or suspend performance of the Contract on account of any default or breach of the Borrower thereunder without written notice to the Agent and first providing to the Agent (i) 30 days from the date notice of
default or breach is delivered to the Agent to cure such default if such default is the failure to pay amounts to the Contracting Party which are due and payable under the Contract, or (ii) a reasonable period, but not fewer than 60 days, to
cure such breach or default if the breach or default cannot be cured by the payment of money to the Contracting Party so long as the Agent, the Borrower or their respective designee shall have commenced to cure the breach or default promptly
following such notice and in any case within such 60-day period and thereafter diligently pursues such cure to completion (but in any event within not more than 120 days) and during such cure period performs all monetary obligations under the
Contract and all other obligations under the Contract are performed by the Borrower or the Agent or their respective designees. For the avoidance of doubt and solely for the purposes of the preceding sentence, amounts not paid and subject to a
dispute in good faith by the Borrower shall not be deemed to be a payment default. The Contracting Party shall not hinder the Agent’s or its designees’ efforts, and shall provide reasonable cooperation to the Agent and its designees, in
effecting any cure of any default or breach of the Borrower under the Contract. Except in the event of a payment default under the Contract, if possession of the Project is necessary to cure such breach or default, and the Agent or its designees or
assignees declares the Borrower in default under the Credit Agreement and within the 60-day period described above commences foreclosure proceedings, the Agent

or its designees or assignees shall be allowed a reasonable period to complete such proceedings so long as (A) the Agent proceeds diligently and in good
faith to do so and during such period performs all monetary obligations under the Contract, and (B) all other obligations under the relevant Contract are performed by the Borrower or the Agent or their respective designees. If the Agent or its
designees or assignees are prohibited by any court order or bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings from curing the default or from commencing or prosecuting foreclosure proceedings, the foregoing time periods shall be extended by the period of such
prohibition so long as (1) the Agent proceeds diligently and in good faith to address such impediments and during such period performs all monetary obligations under the Contract, and (2) all other obligations under the Contract are
performed by the Borrower or the Agent or their respective designees. The Contracting Party consents to the transfer of the Borrower’s interest under each Contract to the Agent or any purchaser, successor, assignee and/or designee (a
“Subsequent Transferee”) of the Assigned Interests at a foreclosure sale by judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure and sale or by a conveyance by the Borrower in lieu of foreclosure and agrees that, notwithstanding any provision of the
Contract to the contrary, upon such foreclosure, sale or conveyance, the Agent or such Subsequent Transferee shall be substituted for the Borrower under the Contract and the Contracting Party (a) shall recognize the Agent or the Subsequent
Transferee, as the case may be, as its counter-party under the Contract, and (b) perform its obligations under the Contract in favor of the Agent or the Subsequent Transferee, as the case may be; provided that the Agent or such Subsequent
Transferee (i) has elected to assume the rights and obligations of the Borrower (including the obligation to cure any then existing payment and performance defaults, but excluding any obligation to cure any then existing performance defaults
which by their nature are incapable of being cured and which default that is incapable of being cured does not materially and adversely affect the rights of the Contracting Party under the Contract) under the Contract, and (ii) would reasonably
be expected to have the capability to perform the Borrower’s obligations under the Contract.
(e) Subject to payment of all amounts due and unpaid to
the Contracting Party and cure of all then existing payment and performance defaults, but excluding any obligation to cure any then existing performance defaults which by their nature are incapable of being cured and which default that is incapable
of being cured does not materially and adversely affect the rights of the Contracting Party under the Contract, in the event the Contract is rejected or terminated by a trustee or debtor in possession in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or
if the Contract is terminated for any reason other than a default which could have been but was not cured by the Agent as provided in Section 1(e) hereof, and if, within 45 days after such rejection or termination, the Agent shall so request,
the Contracting Party shall execute and deliver to the Agent a new Contract having substantially identical terms to the Contract (subject to any conforming changes necessitated by the substitution of parties and such changes as may be necessary to
compensate the Contracting Party for schedule and cost adjustments resulting from the passage of time).
(f) In the event the Agent or its designees or
assignees elect to perform the Borrower’s obligations under a Contract or a new Contract is entered into as provided above in Sections 1(e) or (f), respectively, the liability of the Agent, or its designees or assignees, as the case may be, to
the Contracting Party for the performance of obligations under such Contract, and the sole recourse of the Contracting Party in seeking the enforcement of such obligations, shall be limited to such parties’ rights, title and interest in the
Project.
(g) Except as provided in Sections 1(e), (f) and (g) above, neither the Agent, its designees or assignees shall have any obligation or
liability under the Contract, nor shall the Agent, its designees or assignees be obligated to perform any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower under the Contract or to take any action or collect or enforce any claim for payment or
performance of the Assigned Interests.

Within 30 or 60 days, as the case may be pursuant to Section 1(e), of being notified by the Contracting Party that a Borrower default or breach has
occurred under the Contract, the Agent shall notify the Contracting Party of its intent whether or not to cure any such Borrower default or breach. In the event the Agent fails to notify the Contracting Party within the time period described in the
foregoing sentence that the Agent will cure such default or breach, the Contracting Party shall be entitled to assume that the Agent has elected not to cure such default or breach and the Contracting Party may then exercise all rights that the
Contracting Party would have under the Contract, without regard to the provisions of this Consent. In the absence of such notice, no performance by the Agent, its designees or assignees under or pursuant to this Consent or otherwise (whether to cure
a Borrower default or exercise rights under any provision hereof or otherwise) shall be construed as an assumption by the Agent, its designees or assignees of the obligations and duties of the Borrower under the Contract, unless otherwise expressly
agreed in writing by the Agent, its assignees or designees, as the case may be. The Agent shall have the right to assign all or a pro rata interest in a Contract or a new Contract entered into pursuant to Section 1(f) to a person or entity to
whom the Project is transferred, provided such transferee (i) assumes the obligations of the Borrower (or the Secured Parties) under such Contract and cure of any material defaults under such Contract has been effected as provided herein, and
(ii) would reasonably be expected to have the capability to perform the Borrower’s obligations under such Contract. Upon such assignment, the Agent and the Secured Parties (including their agents and employees) shall be released from any
further liability thereunder to the extent of the interest assigned.
2. Borrower’s Acknowledgment. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the
Contracting Party is authorized to act in accordance with the Agent’s exercise of the Borrower’s rights in accordance with this Consent, and the Contracting Party may rely on any notice or instruction by the Agent in the purported exercise
of the Agent’s rights and remedies hereunder.

may be from a senior in-house counsel), dated as of the dated hereof, substantially in form attached hereto as Addendum 1.

warranty or other provision of this Consent, the Agent’s remedies shall not be so limited, provided that the Agent and the Borrower agree that the Contracting Party’s aggregate liability for monetary damages under this Consent and the
Contract shall be limited as provided in the Contract. Under no circumstances shall the Contracting Party have any liability for any punitive, exemplary, consequential, indirect, incidental, or special damages (including by way of example, but not

forum.

enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
3. The execution and delivery of the Contracts, and fulfillment of and
compliance with the respective provisions of the Contracts, do not conflict with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in any violation of, or result in the creation of any lien

pursuant to, the charter or by-laws of the Company, any applicable law, statute, rule or regulation or (insofar as is known to us after having made due inquiry with respect thereto) any agreement, instrument, order, judgment or decree to which the

compensation, any Work performed hereunder that, at any time for a period of one
year after the earlier of Final  Completion  or the  commencement  of Commercial
Operation,  proves to be improper or defective in material or workmanship or not
in  conformance  with the  requirements  of this  Agreement.  If any  machinery,
equipment,  materials or other items furnished under this Agreement are replaced
during  the last six  months of the  original  warranty  relating  thereto,  the
warranty for such items shall be deemed extended until six months after the date
of  replacement.  In addition  to  correcting  the  improper,  nonconforming  or
defective Work itself,  the General Contractor shall bear all costs and expenses
associated  with  correcting  such warranted Work including  without  limitation
necessary  trouble  shooting,   disassembly,   transportation,   reassembly  and
retesting,  as well as  reworking,  repair  or  replacement  of such  Work,  and
disassembly and reassembly of adjacent work when necessary to give access to the
improper,  defective or nonconforming  Work. The General  Contractor's  warranty
shall not apply to damage  arising  from the  Greenhouse  Operator's  failure to
comply with  prudent  operating  and  maintenance  practices  in the  commercial
greenhouse industry. For the purposes of this Section 10.1, improper workmanship
and defective materials shall be deemed to include, but shall not be limited to,
the following:  (i) faulty or defective  materials,  and defective,  careless or
unskilled execution of the Work; (ii) damage by exposure to foreseeable weather,
windborne  water or surface  drainage;  (iii)  degradation  such as uncontrolled
cracking  or  spatting  of  concrete,  unit  masonry,  cast and  natural  stone,
millwork,  plaster,  glass  and  applied  finishes  such as  paint  and  special
coatings;  (iv) "pot-holing" of pavement; (v) mechanical or electrical equipment
which  does not  operate  in a  satisfactory,  quiet  and  efficient  manner  as
determined by the Owner in its reasonable discretion,  or which does not perform
the functions specified in the Scope of Work or Specifications;  or (vi) unusual
injury  or  deterioration  of the  Work  when in  normal  use by the  Greenhouse
Operator.

10.2. Subcontractor Warranties.

The General Contractor shall, for the protection of the Owner and its successors
and assigns,  obtain from all  Subcontractors  guarantees  and  warranties  with
respect to  machinery,  equipment,  materials and other items used and installed
hereunder,  which  guarantees and warranties  shall not be amended,  modified or
otherwise  discharged  without  the prior  written  consent  of the Owner . Such
guarantees  and warranties  shall be in accordance  with  reasonable  commercial
greenhouse industry  standards,  shall be assignable to the Owner, shall cover a
period of not less than one year from the  earlier  of Final  Completion  or the
commencement of Commercial  Operation,  and shall be made available to the Owner
to the full extent of the terms thereof after assignment. The General Contractor
shall enforce such  guarantees  and  warranties to the fullest extent thereof on


21
<PAGE>

behalf of the Owner until such time as they are assigned to the Owner.  Upon the
earlier to occur of (i) issuance of the Certificate of Final Completion, or (ii)
termination  of this  Agreement  pursuant to Article 15, the General  Contractor
shall   assign  to  the  Owner  all  the  General   Contractor's   rights  under
Subcontractor guarantees and warranties and shall deliver to the Owner copies of
all contracts providing for such guarantees and warranties.

10.3. Engineering And Design.

The General Contractor  warrants and guarantees that it shall perform all of its
engineering and design services in accordance with sound  engineering  practice,
Governmental  Approvals and applicable Laws and that, when complete, the Project
will be free of all deficiencies caused by errors or omissions in engineering or
design  (other  than errors or  omissions  in the  engineering  or design of the
growing systems  specified by the Owner in Schedule 1). For a period of one year
from  the  earlier  of  Final  Completion  or  the  commencement  of  Commercial
Operation,  the General  Contractor shall, as the Owner's sole remedy for breach
of this warranty,  at its own expense correct any such efforts and omissions and
resulting  deficiencies  in the  Project as soon as  reasonably  possible  after
receipt of notice from the Owner specifying such deficiencies.

10.4. No Liens.

The  General  Contractor  warrants  and  guarantees  that  title  to  all  work,
materials, supplies and equipment provided hereunder will pass to the Owner upon
payment by the Owner to the General  Contractor  therefor  free and clear of all
liens,  claims,  security  interests,  charges  and any  other  encumbrances  or
preferential  arrangements,  including  without  limitation the lien or retained
security title of a conditional  vendor  ("Liens"),  and that none of such work,
materials,  supplies or  equipment  will be  acquired by the General  Contractor
subject to any agreement  under which a Lien is retained by any person or entity
except as otherwise provided by Law.

10.5. Limitation Of Warranties.

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED  HEREIN,  THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES OR  GUARANTEES,  EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED,  RELATING TO THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR'S  PERFORMANCE  HEREUNDER,  AND THE
GENERAL CONTRACTOR DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES IMPOSED BY LAW
(OTHER THAN WARRANTIES OF TITLE).

ARTICLE 11.       FORCE MAJEURE

prevents  the  performance  of the Owner or the  General  Contractor  under this
Agreement  or the  compliance  with any  conditions  required by the other party
under this  Agreement if such act or event is beyond the  reasonable  control of
the  party  relying  thereon  as  justification   for  such   nonperformance  or
noncompliance  and such party has been unable to  overcome  such act or event by
the exercise of due diligence,  including but not limited to (but subject to the
foregoing) flood, drought,  unusually severe weather,  earthquake,  storm, fire,
explosion, sabotage or threat of sabotage of the Facility, the Greenhouse or the
pipeline, pestilence,  epidemic, lightning and other natural catastrophes;  war,
riot,  civil  disturbance or  disobedience,  action or inaction of  legislative,

equipment  supplied by Subcontractors  for temporary services during performance
of the Work which has been  maintained in accordance  with good  engineering and
operating  practices  applicable  thereto;  or loss or  shortage  of  utilities.
Economic  hardship  and  strikes,  work  stoppages  or  labor  disturbances  are
explicitly excluded as Force Majeure Events.

11.2. Limitation Of Default.

No  party  shall be  considered  in  default  in the  performance  of any of the
agreements  contained in this  Agreement,  except for the Owner's or the General
Contractor's  obligations  to pay money when and to the  extent  the  failure of
performance shall be caused by a Force Majeure Event.

11.3. Excused Performance.

If any party is  rendered  wholly or partly  unable to perform  its  obligations
under  this  Agreement  because  of a Force  Majeure  Event,  that party will be
excused from whatever  performance is affected by the Force Majeure Event to the
extent so affected; provided that:

(a)  the nonperforming  party, within five (5) days after the occurrence of
the  Force  Majeure  Event,  gives the other  parties  written  notice
describing the particulars of such occurrence, including an estimation
of its expected duration and probable impact on the performance of the
affected  party's  obligations  hereunder,  and  continues  to furnish
timely regular reports with respect thereto during the continuation of
and upon the termination of the Force Majeure Event;

(b)  the  suspension of performance is of no greater scope and of no longer
duration than is reasonably required by the Force Majeure Event;

(c)  the obligations of any party which arose before the occurrence causing
the  suspension of  performance  and the  performance  of which is not
prevented by the occurrence,  shall not be excused as a result of such
occurrence; and

(d)  the nonperforming  party uses its best efforts to remedy its inability
to perform  and  mitigate  the effect of such  event and  resumes  its
performance  at the earliest  practical  time after  cessation of such
occurrence.

11.4. Right To Terminate For Force Majeure.

If a suspension of performance by any party as a result of a Force Majeure Event
exceeds  sixty (60) days,  the parties  whose  performance  is unaffected by the
Force  Majeure Event may terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant and subject to the
terms of Section 15.5 hereof; provided,  however that the General Contractor may
not  terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant  to Section  15.5 hereof if and to the
extent  that a Change  relating  to such  Force  Majeure  Event  shall have been
approved by the Owner and the  General  Contractor  pursuant  to Section  12.2.2
hereof.

ARTICLE 12.       CHANGES IN THE PROJECT AND SUSPENSION

12.1. Changes.

At any time and from time to time prior to the  issuance of the  Certificate  of
Final Completion,  the Owner,  without  invalidating or amending this Agreement,
may order  changes in the  Project  within the general  scope of this  Agreement
consisting of additions,  deletions or other  revisions  (such changes,  and the
changes  permitted under Section 12.2, being referred to collectively  herein as
"Changes"),  in which  event the  Contract  Price,  the  Substantial  Completion
Deadline,  the Contract Deadline,  and the Major Milestone Schedule set forth in
Appendix  H to this  Agreement  shall be  adjusted  accordingly,  if  necessary,
pursuant to Section  12.1.1.  No Change will be effected  without an  authorized
Change  Order (as defined in Section  12.1.2).

12.1.1. Procedure For Changes. Except as provided in Section 12.2, only the
Owner may  initiate  Changes.  At no cost to the Owner,  the General  Contractor
shall promptly  review the Owner's  proposal and provide the Owner , within five
(5) days thereafter, with notice in writing of the effect, if any, such proposed
Change would have on the Contract Price,  the Substantial  Completion  Deadline,
the Contract Deadline, and the Major Milestone Schedule.  Such notice also shall
include an analysis  demonstrating  (i) the time impact, if any, of the proposed
Change on the critical path items yet to be completed  (including  the influence
of such Change on the current dates  scheduled for  Substantial  Completion  and
Final  Completion) and (ii) how the General  Contractor  proposes to incorporate
the time impact on non-critical  path items into the schedule  without  schedule
alleviation.  If, in the General Contractor's  opinion,  Project schedule and/or
performance  may  be  maintained  or  adjustments   thereof  minimized  only  by
increasing the Contract Price, the General Contractor shall, in such notice, set
forth  possible   trade-offs  among  or  between  Project  cost,   schedule  and
performance  so  that  the  Owner  may  make  an  informed   choice  among  such
alternatives  in  deciding  whether  to issue a Change  Order.  The Owner  shall
promptly review the information  provided by the General Contractor  pursuant to
this Section  12.1.1 and thereupon the Owner may issue a Change Order  approving
and authorizing  such proposed Change,  in which event the cost,  scheduling and
performance  alternative  included in the General  Contractor's notice described
above and chosen by the Owner  shall be binding on the General  Contractor.  The
General  Contractor  shall use all  reasonable  efforts to  minimize  any effect
adverse to the Owner of any Change on Project cost,  scheduling and performance.
The  Change  Order  issued by the  Owner  will  authorize  an  extension  in the
Substantial Completion Deadline and/or the Contract Deadline only if the General
Contractor  establishes,  to the Owner's 's  reasonable  satisfaction,  that the
nature of the proposed Change would  necessitate  such  extension.  All Changes,
whether  initiated by the Owner or the General  Contractor  under  Section 12.2,
shall be authorized by a Change Order,  and shall be performed  pursuant to this
Agreement.  Any  change  in the  Project  necessitated  by any  change  in Laws,
Governmental  Approvals or Private Rights-of-Way after the effective date hereof
shall be  treated  as a Change  pursuant  to this  Article  12 unless the change
necessitated comes within the definition of Modification, in which case it shall
be treated as a Modification pursuant to this Article 12.

12.1.2.  Change Orders.  A "Change Order" is a written order to the General
Contractor signed by a duly authorized representative of the Owner authorizing a
Change in the Project. Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement,  the Owner
shall  deliver to the General  Contractor  written  notice signed by the Owner ,
stating which  officers or  representatives  are  authorized  to


24
<PAGE>

approve  Change  Orders.  If and when,  after  execution  and  delivery  of this
Agreement,  another  officer is selected  by either the Owner to approve  Change
Orders, such party shall deliver to the General Contractor another notice signed
by such  party so  authorizing  such new  officer or  representative  to approve
Change  Orders.  For the purpose of  determining  who has  authority  to approve
Change Orders,  the General  Contractor  shall be entitled to rely on the latest
notice  delivered by the Owner  pursuant to this Section  12.1.2 and received by
the General Contractor.

12.1.3.  No Changes Due To Contractor  Error.  Notwithstanding  anything in
this Article 12 to the contrary, no Changes shall be issued to correct errors or
omissions on the part of the General Contractor which result in construction not
in  accordance  with the Contract  Documents as they existed at the time of such
error or omission.

12.2. Other Changes.

12.2.1.  Changes In Laws,  Approvals Or Rights-Of-Way.  In the event and to
the extent a change in Laws,  Governmental  Approvals  or Private  Rights-of-Way
necessitates a change in the Work, the General Contractor may (and, if requested
by the Owner  shall  submit a written  request  for a Change to the Owner,  such
Change to be  incorporated  into the Project upon  approval by the Owner , which
approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld,  by issuance  of a Change  Order
pursuant to Section 12.1.1.

12.2.2. Changes Due To Delays In Interfaces Or Force Majeure Events. In the
event and to the extent that (i)  completion of  interfaces or  interconnections
with third  parties are delayed due to causes  beyond the control of the General
Contractor,  and General Contractor's performance is adversely affected thereby,
or (ii) a Force  Majeure  Event  prevents the General  Contractor's  performance
hereunder,  and all of the  requirements  of Section  11.3 (a)  through  (d) are
satisfied,  the General Contractor shall be entitled to (and if requested by the
Ownershall  request) a Change pursuant to, and to the extent authorized by, this
Section 12.2.2.  In such event, the Contract Price,  the Substantial  Completion
Deadline,  the Contract Deadline,  and the Major Milestone Schedule set forth in
Appendix H to this  Agreement  shall be adjusted to the extent of the actual and
verifiable  effects,  if  any,  which  General  Contractor  demonstrates  to the
reasonable  satisfaction of the Owner that such delay or Force Majeure Event has
had upon General  Contractor's  performance of its obligations  hereunder.  Such
Change  shall be  incorporated  into the Project by  issuance of a Change  Order
pursuant to Section 12.1.1.

12.3. Modifications.

Without  invalidating  or amending this  Agreement,  the Owner may order and the
General Contractor may propose, subject to approval by the Owner , modifications
in the Project within the general scope, and consistent with the intent,  of the
Contract   Documents   (such   modifications   being   referred   to  herein  as
"Modifications") consisting of additions,  deletions or other revisions, so long
as  such   Modifications  do  not  adversely  affect  the  Contract  Price,  the
Substantial Completion Deadline, and the Contract Deadline.


25
<PAGE>

12.4. Contract Price Change.

A Contract Price increase,  if any, resulting from a Change in the Project shall
be  determined  in one or more  of the  following  ways  and  paid by the  Owner
pursuant to the schedule of Progress Payments adjusted  accordingly:

12.4.1.  By the  acceptance  by the  Owner  of a lump sum  proposed  by the
General Contractor properly itemized and supported by sufficient  substantiating
data to permit evaluation; or

12.4.2.  If the method set forth in Section 12.4.1 is not agreed upon after
good faith negotiation by the parties,  the General Contractor shall provide the
Owner with such purchase orders, invoices and other documents and records as may
enable the Owner to verify,  to their reasonable  satisfaction,  the cost to the
General Contractor of effecting such Change. All equipment,  materials and other
items  required as a result of such  Change  shall be  purchased  by the General
Contractor at competitive market prices.

12.5. Continued Performance Pending Resolution Of Disputes.

Notwithstanding a dispute regarding the adequacy of a Contract Price increase or
schedule adjustment for a proposed Change, or whether a Modification should be a
Change because it affects the Contract Price or schedule, the General Contractor
shall proceed with the performance of such Change or Modification.

12.6. Suspension.

The Owner may, by written notice to the General Contractor,  suspend at any time
the  performance  of all or any portion of the Work to be  performed  under this
Agreement so long as (a) the  Substantial  Completion  Deadline and the Contract
Deadline  are  extended  an amount of time equal to the  actual  and  verifiable
impact on the Project  schedule caused by such suspension and (b) the suspension
of any material part on the Project  schedule  caused by such suspension and (b)
the  suspension  of any  material  part of the Work shall be for a period not to
exceed  sixty (60) days.  Suspension  of the Work  under this  Agreement  may be
accomplished  only by the written notice  described in this Section 12.6.

12.7. Suspension Process.

Upon receipt of a notice given pursuant to Section 12.6, the General  Contractor
shall, unless the notice requires otherwise:

(a)  immediately  discontinue  work on the date and to the extent specified
in such notice;

(b)  place no  further  orders or  subcontracts  for  equipment,  material,
services,  or other items with respect to suspended work other than to
the extent  required  in such  notice and to the  extent  required  to
protect the Work;


26
<PAGE>

(c)  promptly make every reasonable  effort to obtain suspension upon terms
satisfactory  to the  Owner of all  orders,  subcontracts  and  rental
agreements to the extent they relate to performance of suspended work;

(d)  continue to protect and maintain the work  performed  including  those
portions on which work has been suspended; and

(e)  take any other reasonable steps to minimize costs associated with such
suspension.

12.8. Resumption Of Work.

Upon  receipt of notice  from the Owner to resume  suspended  work,  the General
Contractor  shall  immediately  resume  performance  under this Agreement to the
extent required in such notice.

12.9. Contract Changes Due To Suspension.

If the  General  Contractor  believes  that  any  suspension  or  resumption  of
suspended  Work  justifies  a Change  in the  Contract  Price,  the  Substantial
Completion Deadline,  the Contract Deadline or any other affected obligations of
the General  Contractor  hereunder,  the General Contractor must, within 30 days
after  receipt of the notice of  suspension  or  resumption  as the case may be,
submit to the Owner a written statement setting forth the justification for such
a Change in reasonable detail. If a Change is justified, the Owner shall issue a
Change  Order  under  which  the  Contract  Price,  the  Substantial  Completion
Deadline,  the  Contract  Deadline  and any other  affected  obligations  of the
General   Contractor  under  this  Agreement  shall  be  equitably  adjusted  to
compensate  for  the  effect  of  the  suspension.

12.10. Termination Due To Suspension.

If a  suspension  by the Owner of all or a material  portion of the Work exceeds
sixty (60) days the General  Contractor  may  terminate  this  Agreement  in the
manner set forth in Section 15.4 hereof.

ARTICLE 13.       PAYMENTS TO GENERAL CONTRACTOR

13.1. Initial Payment.

Promptly after issuance of the Notice to Proceed,  the General  Contractor shall
submit  to  the  Owner  an  initial  payment  request  supported  by an  invoice
reflecting an amount of which has been  determined  pursuant to the  Application
for Payment,  the form of which is attached hereto as Appendix I.

13.2. Monthly Progress Payments.

Progress payments shall be made by the Owner to the General Contractor according
to the following procedure:

13.2.1.  On or before the tenth day of each calendar  month  beginning with
the first month following receipt of the initial payment under Section 13.1, the
General Contractor shall submit to the Owner an "Application for Payment," which
shall include (i) the monthly progress report prepared pursuant to Section 2.4.1
(a), and (ii) an invoice reflecting an amount which has


27
<PAGE>

been determined  pursuant to the  Application for Payment,  the form of which is
attached as Appendix I, which amount, together with all previous amounts paid by
the Owner to the General Contractor,  shall reflect work on the Project actually
accomplished through the preceding calendar month. The General Contractor agrees
that it will not include in any  Application for Payment a bill for materials or
equipment  until such  materials or equipment have been delivered to the Project
Site. Similarly, the General Contractor will not include in such Application for
Payment a bill for labor until such labor has been performed.

13.2.2. The Owner shall pay to the General Contractor, within ten (10) days
after receipt of the Application for Payment,  the amount determined pursuant to
Section 13.2.1 for Work  performed  during the month prior to the month in which
the  Application  for Payment is tendered,  less 10% retainage to be withheld by
the Project Lender from payments to the General  Contractor,  or  subcontractors
(all  such  monthly  amounts  paid by the  Owner  being  herein  referred  to as
"Progress  Payments"),  subject to  adjustment  as provided  in Section  13.2.3.
"Retainage"  shall be ten percent (10%) of the amount of each monthly payment or
other payment to be made by the General Contractor pursuant to Sections 13.1 and
13.2.

13.2.3.  If the Owner disagrees with the General  Contractor's  estimate of
actual  Project  progress (as reflected in an  Application  for Payment) and the
cumulative  total of all amounts in dispute  (reflecting the difference  between
the General  Contractor's and the Owner's estimates of actual progress) does not
exceed  $50,000.00,  the Owner shall pay the General  Contractor  such  disputed
amount  pursuant to Section  13.2.2 as part of the  pertinent  Progress  Payment
within  ten (10) days after  receipt  of the  Application  for  Payment  and any
disputed  amounts in excess of the  cumulative  total of $50,000 may be withheld
from the  General  Contractor  by the Owner,  provided,  however,  that  amounts
withheld  by the Owner  pursuant  to this  Section  13.2.3  shall be paid to the
General  Contractor  when  the  General  Contractor  has  demonstrated,   in  an
Application for Payment completed to the reasonable  satisfaction of the Owner ,
that actual progress requiring such payment has been achieved.

13.2.4.  If the Owner fails to make its Progress  Payments  hereunder on or
before the date due, or if the Owner withholds payment of any amount pursuant to
Section 13.2.3, and it is subsequently  determined that such withholding was not
justified  hereunder,  interest on any unpaid  amount  shall accrue from the due
date at the lesser of (a) the Base Rate plus two  percent  (2%) per annum or (b)
the maximum  permitted legal interest rate at the time prevailing and applicable
thereto.

13.2.5.  The Owner  shall  have no  obligation  to make any  payment to the
General  Contractor  while the General  Contractor is in material breach of this
Agreement. In addition, the Owner may withhold payment to the General Contractor
to the extent  reasonably  necessary  to protect the Owner from loss due to: (i)
defective  Work not remedied;  (ii) claims for payment or liens  asserted by the
General  Contractor  or any  Subcontractor;  (iii) the  failure  of the  General
Contractor  to  promptly  pay any  Subcontractor;  (iv)  damage to the person or
property  of  any  separate  contractor,  agent,  invitee  of the  Owner  or (v)
reasonable  doubt on the Owner's part that the Project can be completed  for the
balance of the Contract Price yet unpaid.


28
<PAGE>

13.2.6.  As promptly as possible  after the Notice to Proceed,  the General
Contractor shall send the Owner a notice specifying all Facility equipment to be
ordered  from  outside  vendors,  indicating  the time such  equipment  is to be
ordered and specifying the General Contractor's cost thereof. The Project Lender
shall,  upon the Owner's and Project Lender's  approval of the amounts and items
specified,  set aside or otherwise  designate for  application to such equipment
purchases  sufficient funds to pay for the Facility  equipment  described in the
notice,   and  shall  send  the  Owner,  and  the  General   Contractor  written
confirmation of the same.

13.3. Waiver And Release Of Liens.

The General Contractor shall protect and keep free and clear from Liens the land
upon which the  Facility is to be  constructed,  and any and all  interests  and
estates  therein,  and  all  improvements  and  materials  arising  out of or in
connection  with  performance  by  the  General  Contractor,  or  Subcontractor,
including  services  or  furnishing  of any  materials  hereunder.  The  General
Contractor  shall  furnish  to the  Owner,  and  shall  require  each and  every
Subcontractor  engaged to supply services or materials in an amount greater than
$50,000 (or any lesser amount if requested by the Owner) in connection  with the
Project to furnish to the General Contractor for delivery to the Owner, upon the
making  of the  initial  payment  pursuant  to  Section  13.1 and at the time of
submission of each  Application  for Payment a recordable  partial waiver of its
right to assert Liens on the  Project,  such waiver to be  substantially  in the
form of Appendix J-1 and as a precondition to the making of the Final Payment, a
recordable waiver of its right to assert Liens on the Project, such waiver to be
in substantially  the form of Appendix J-2.  Effectiveness of such waivers shall
be conditioned  upon General  Contractor's  receipt of payment from the Owner of
payments then due to the General Contractor under this Agreement. If the General
Contractor fails to furnish,  or cause any  Subcontractor to furnish,  a legally
effective waiver or fails to have any Lien released or discharged forthwith,  in
lieu thereof the General  Contractor  shall  furnish a bond or other  collateral
satisfactory to the Owner to indemnify the Owner against any loss resulting from
such Lien. In addition, until such release,  discharge or bonding, the Owner may
withhold  from any payment due the General  Contractor  an amount  sufficient to
discharge any or all such Liens or claims.

13.4. Payment Upon Completion.

Upon  delivery  of the  Certificate  of  Final  Completion,  recordation  of the
Affidavit of Completion and  satisfaction  of other  statutory  requirements  in
accordance with 9.3.2 of the Loan Agreement, and the passing of at least 30 days
since the date of Final  Completion,  the Owner shall pay the unpaid  portion of
the Contract Price due to the General Contractor  (including the amount, if any,
of equal cost savings  represented by the difference  between the Contract Price
and the amount previously paid to the General Contractor).

13.5. Payment Or Use Not Acceptance.

No payment  made or any partial or entire use of the Facility by the Owner shall
constitute  an  acceptance  of any of the  Work  not  in  accordance  with  this
Agreement and the Scope of Work.

13.6. Waiver By Owner.

The making of the Final Payment  shall  constitute a waiver of all claims by the
Owner except:


29
<PAGE>

(a)  those  arising  from  unsettled  liens,  security  interests  or other
encumbrances;

(b)  those arising from any warranties, guarantees and indemnities provided
hereunder; and

(c)  those arising from Final Punch-List and clean-up items.

13.7. Waiver By General Contractor.

Acceptance of the Final  Payment shall  constitute a waiver of all claims by the
General Contractor except for unresolved claims for Changes previously  asserted
in writing by the General  Contractor.

13.8.  General  Contractor's  Performance  With Respect To Applications For
Payment.

The General Contractor is responsible to prepare and submit, in appropriate form
and  order  and in a timely  manner,  all the  necessary  forms  and  supporting
documentation  (if  any),  on  behalf of the  General  Contractor,  to the Owner
required in this Article 13 or by the Project Lender under the Loan Agreement to
ensure the timely payment of all amounts owed to the General Contractor, and all
subcontractors,  vendors,  or  suppliers  related  to  the  construction  of the
Project.

ARTICLE 14.       INDEMNITY, INSURANCE AND WAIVER OF SUBROGATION

14.1. Indemnity.

14.1.1.  Indemnity By General  Contractor.  The General  Contractor  hereby
indemnifies  and holds  harmless the Owner and their  respective  successors and
assigns and their  respective  shareholders,  directors,  officers and employees
(each being hereinafter  referred to as an "Indemnified Party") from and against
any and all loss, cost (including reasonable  attorneys' fees), damage,  injury,
liability,  claims, demands, interest and causes of action (a) for bodily injury
or property damage that may arise from the General Contractor's operations under
this  Agreement,  except to the extent arising from the negligence or misconduct
of such  Indemnified  Party,  (b) because of any violation of Law to be complied
with by the General Contractor hereunder,  (c) in respect of any taxes levied on
the General  Contractor or in respect of the General  Contractor's net income or

during  and  arising  out  of  the  General  Contractor's  performance  of  this
Agreement;

14.2.1.2. Such insurance is primary insurance with respect to the interests
of the Owner and the Project Lender, and any other insurance  maintained by them

14.2.1.3.  Such  policies  provide that (a) the  inclusion of more than one
corporation,  person,  organization,  firm or entity as insured thereunder shall
not in any way affect the rights of any such corporation,  person, organization,
firm or entity as respects any claim,  demand, suit or judgment made, brought or
recovered,  by or in  favor  of any  other  insured,  or by or in  favor  of any
employee of such other insured, and (b) each corporation,  person, organization,
firm,  or entity is  protected  thereby in the same  manner as though a separate
policy had been issued to each,  but nothing  therein  shall operate to increase

keep in force,  during the time in which they are engaged in performing services

matters  within the scope of the General  Contractor's  indemnity  under Section

appear, subject to any applicable mortgagee clause.

14.6. No Effect On Liability.

The requirement that the General Contractor, Subcontractors or the Owner furnish
certain  minimum  insurance  coverages  is not to be  interpreted  as in any way
limiting the  liability of the General  Contractor  or the Owner as the case may
be, nor does  either  party,  by  furnishing  or  requiring  evidence of certain
minimum insurance,  assume, or intend to assume, any liability that it would not
otherwise have in the absence of such a requirement.

14.7. Owner's Election Regarding All Risk Insurance.

omission persists for a period of thirty (30) days, and in the case of
either  (b)(i) or b(ii),  the  General  Contractor  fails to cure such
default within fifteen (15) days after  receiving  notice thereof from
the Owner  (unless such default is of a nature that it cannot be cured
within  such  fifteen  (15)  day  period,  in which  case the  General
Contractor  shall be in compliance  herewith if it presents a plan for
such cure which is reasonably acceptable to the Owner,  commences such
cure within such fifteen (15) day period,  and diligently pursues such
cure to completion within sixty (60) days after the aforestated notice

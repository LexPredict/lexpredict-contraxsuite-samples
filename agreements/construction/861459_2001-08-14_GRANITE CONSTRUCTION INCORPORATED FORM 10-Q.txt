accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted, although the Company believes the disclosures which
are made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
Further, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the
opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to
present fairly the financial position at June 30, 2001 and the results of
operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The December 31, 2000
condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited
financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by
generally accepted accounting principles.

Interim results are subject to significant seasonal variations and the
results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2001 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

2.   INVENTORIES: Inventories consist primarily of quarry products valued at the
lower of average cost or market.

6.   CONTINGENCIES AND CONTINGENCIES:

DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES - LITIGATION: The Company is a party to
a number of legal proceedings and believes that the nature and number of
these proceedings are typical for a construction firm of its size and
scope, and that none of these proceedings are material to the Company's
financial position. The Company's litigation typically involves claims
regarding public liability or contract related issues.

7.   RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain prior year financial statement items have been
reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

8.   STOCK SPLIT: On February 21, 2001, the Company announced a three for two
stock split in the form of a 50% stock dividend payable April 13, 2001. All
references in the financial statements to number of shares and per share
amounts of the Company's common stock have been retroactively restated to
reflect the increased number of shares outstanding.

9.   INVESTMENT IN WILDER CONSTRUCTION: On February 23, 2001, the Company
purchased an additional 450,000 shares of Wilder Construction Company
("Wilder") common stock for a purchase price of approximately $4.6 million.
The Company currently holds a 48% minority interest in Wilder. At June 30,
2001 the Company held 1,949,746 shares of Wilder stock.

10.  LONG-TERM DEBT: In May 2001 the Company issued long-term debt in the amount
of $75.0 million to a group of institutional holders. The notes are due in
nine equal annual installments beginning in 2005 and bear interest at 6.96%
per annum. Restrictive covenants under the agreement require the
maintenance of consolidated net worth (as defined) of approximately
$289,000. The funds will be used for general corporate purposes.

11.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION: The Company has two reportable segments: the
Branch Division and the Heavy Construction Division ("HCD"). The Branch
Division is comprised of branch offices that serve local markets, while HCD
pursues major infrastructure projects throughout the nation. HCD generally
has large heavy-civil projects with contract amounts in excess of $15
million and contract durations greater than two years, while the Branch
Division projects are typically smaller in size and shorter in duration.
HCD has been the primary participant in the Company's construction joint
ventures.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates
performance based on operating profit or loss which does not include income
taxes, interest income, interest expense or other income (expense).

12.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: In July 2001, the Financial Accounting
and Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), "Business Combinations," and No. 142 ("SFAS
142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS 141 requires that all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under
a single method--the purchase method. Use of the pooling-of-interests
method is no longer permitted. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill no longer be
amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for impairment upon initial
adoption of the Statement and on an annual basis going forward. The
amortization of goodwill will cease upon adoption of SFAS 142. The
provisions of SFAS 142 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any,
of adopting SFAS 141 and 142.

13.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT: On July 1, 2001 the Company acquired 100% of the common
stock of Halmar Builders of New York, Inc., a Mt. Vernon, New York
heavy-civil construction company ("Halmar") for a cash purchase price of
approximately $19.0 million, subject to final closing adjustments. The new
entity will operate under the name Granite Halmar Construction Company,
Inc. ("Granite Halmar") as a wholly owned subsidiary of Granite
Construction Incorporated. If Granite Halmar achieves certain predetermined
financial results over a two-year period, the Company will pay the former
Halmar shareholders up to an additional $2.0 million.

Halmar is one of the largest heavy-civil construction firms operating in
the metropolitan New York City area. In 2000, Halmar had revenues of
approximately $200 million. The acquisition will be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS 141. The Company is
currently in the process of preparing the purchase price allocation and
determining the useful lives of the assets acquired.

Revenue: Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2001 increased in both
the Branch Division and the HCD over the corresponding quarter in 2000. The
Branch Division saw increased revenue from its public sector projects in both
the quarter and six month periods in 2001 reflecting increases in funding for
public infrastructure projects due primarily to the impact of TEA-21 funding.
Partially offsetting the increased public sector revenue in the Branch Division
was a decrease in private sector revenue of $18.1 million and $13.2 million for
the 2001 quarter and six month periods, respectively, from the same periods in
2000. As further discussed in the "Outlook" section, the Company believes there
has been some softening of the private sector market.

The increased HCD revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2001 over the
corresponding 2000 quarter is a reflection of the division's strong backlog of
public sector projects. HCD's private sector revenue decreased $13.9 million in
the second quarter of 2001 as compared to the second quarter of 2000 due to the
completion of two large private sector projects in 2000. For the six month
period ended


12
<PAGE>   13
June 30, 2001, HCD private sector revenue decreased $24.6 million compared to
the corresponding six month period in 2000 due to lower first quarter 2001
revenue which reflected the large percentage of contracts - particularly
design/build contracts - awarded in late 2000 that were in their start-up phase.
Design/build projects experience a longer lead time and therefore a slower start
than a typical bid/build project.

million share of a design/build highway reconstruction project in Arizona and a
$15.4 million interstate reconstruction project in Utah.

Gross Profit: Gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased to 12.3% in
the second quarter 2001 from 14.5% in the second quarter 2000 and to 11.4% for
the six months ended June 30, 2001 from 13.6% in the corresponding 2000 period.
The lower gross profit margin is primarily due to a higher amount of revenue
recognized from projects less than 25% complete, particularly in HCD. The
Company recognizes revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until a project
reaches 25% complete. The amount of revenue generated in the quarter by jobs
below the 25% completion threshold was approximately $58.0 million versus $20.0
million in the same period in 2000. The increase is primarily due to several HCD
projects that were awarded in late 2000 and early 2001 including three that are
not expected to reach 25% complete in 2001. The $153.0 million Las Vegas
Monorail Project, the $164.6 million Hiawatha Light Rail Project in Minneapolis
and the $65.9 million St. John's River Bridge in Florida are not expected to
reach 25% complete until the first half of 2002. In addition, HCD gross profit
margin in the second quarter 2001 was impacted by a reduction in the forecasted
profitability of a non-sponsored joint venture project on the East Coast. The
profit reduction reflects the acceleration of work to complete the project on
time to avoid paying liquidated damages. The Company recorded a pretax loss of
approximately $2.5 million for its portion of the expected reduced profitability
of the project.

Cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts; including labor
and materials, amounts payable to subcontractors, direct overhead costs, and
equipment expense (primarily depreciation, maintenance and repairs). The Company
has experienced some upward pressure on costs associated with labor markets,
however, the Company's gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by
such changes during the first six months of 2001.

</TABLE>

General and Administrative Expenses: Salaries and related expenses
increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2001 over the comparable
periods in 2000 due primarily to increased staffing to support the Company's
current and expected growth. Incentive compensation and discretionary profit
sharing and pension costs decreased as a function of the Company's lower
profitability in 2001. Increases in other general and administrative expenses
primarily result from costs associated with the pursuit of new business
opportunities and the support of the Company's continued growth, none of which
exceeds 10% of total general and administrative expenses.

increased in both the three months and six months ended June 30, 2001 due
primarily to the increases in revenue described in "Revenue and Backlog" above.

Other Income (Expense): Other income increased $0.6 million to $6.0
million for the six months ended June 30, 2001 over the same period in 2000. The
increase was due primarily to a $2.2 million gain from the sale of developed
property in Texas in the first quarter 2001, partially offset by lower interest
income due primarily to reduced interest rates and the absence of a $0.6 million
gain recorded in the second quarter 2000 from the repurchase by T.I.C. Holdings,
Inc. ("TIC") of certain TIC shares held by the Company.

Provision for Income Taxes: The Company's effective tax rate decreased
to 38.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2001 from 38.5% in the same period
in 2000. The decrease relates primarily to the expected changes in the
relationship of permanent differences such as the percentage depletion deduction
to pretax earnings for the year. Additionally, the decrease in the effective tax
rate for the six months ended June 30, 2001 reflects the absence of additional
tax expense recognized in the first quarter of 2000 related to the Company
reaching an agreement with TIC to divest its investment over a three and
one-half year period.

OUTLOOK

The Company continues to experience a sizeable increase in new awards.
New awards for the second quarter ended June 30, 2001 totaled $459.1 million,
leading to a record backlog at June 30, 2001 of $1.44 billion, an increase of
60.4 percent over the backlog at June 30, 2000. The second quarter 2001 backlog
does not include the approximately $200.0 million backlog the Company assumed
with the acquisition of Halmar Builders of New York Inc., which closed July 1,
2001. The Company believes its backlog is a quality backlog that will provide a
springboard for revenue and earnings growth in 2002 and beyond.

As the Company pointed out in a press release dated July 24, 2001,
earnings expectations for 2001 will be lower than previously expected. The
primary reason for this is that it now anticipates that three large HCD projects
will not reach 25 percent complete this year. The $153.0 million Las Vegas
Monorail Project, the $164.6 million Hiawatha Light Rail Project in Minnesota
and the $65.9 million St. John's River Bridge in Florida are not expected to
reach 25 percent complete until the first half of 2002.

Even though the Company has reduced its earnings expectations for the
year, the fundamentals of its public sector business are still extremely strong.
The bulk of the Company's new awards continue to come from its public
marketplace. Fueled by record level expenditures from federal, state and local
sources, the Company expects that the public sector market will remain strong as
the year continues to unfold. As it has noted in the past, the public
marketplace that the Company is currently experiencing allows it to be very
selective in its bidding, looking at those projects where it may have
competitive advantages in terms of resources or expertise.

The visibility of the Company's private sector business, however, is
less clear at this point in time. The Company has witnessed some softening in
this marketplace, particularly in California, where the bulk of its private
sector business is derived. Granite believes that this is due primarily to a
weaker economy, which has prompted private developers to delay planned
commercial and residential projects. The potential effect on Granite's business
is a decrease in private sector bidding opportunities and the probability of
increased competition in the public sector. The Company, however, is unable at
this time to identify how much increased public sector opportunities might
offset diminished opportunities in the private sector and what, if any impact
this will have on full year 2001 results.

As previously mentioned, the Company closed its acquisition of Halmar
Builders of New York, Inc. on July 1, 2001. The Mt. Vernon, New York-based heavy
civil contractor campaigns the New York Metropolitan area, focusing primarily on
transportation-related projects such as airports, highways and mass transit
facilities. Halmar, in 2000, had revenues of approximately $200.0 million. The
New York area heavy-civil construction marketplace is estimated to yield about
$6.0 billion per year in bidding opportunities. Granite believes Halmar's
contribution to its 2001 earnings will be neutral to slightly accretive.

In the Outlook section of the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 2001, the Company discussed the potential impact on Granite's business
and markets from the electricity crisis in California. To date, milder than
normal temperatures and substantial conservation measures

<PAGE>   17

on the part of California electric users have mitigated the need for rolling
blackouts or the necessity to borrow more money from various internal accounts,
including the highway account, to purchase power. As of this writing, the state
has not borrowed any money from the highway account. Under the confines of
Proposition 2, any money borrowed from the highway account by law has to be paid
back within one year, with interest.

California took a large step forward last month in formulating a
solution to its long-term transportation-funding problem. As part of the state's
budget negotiations, the legislature agreed to place a constitutional amendment
on the March, 2002 ballot to permanently divert the sales tax on gasoline from
the state's general fund to the transportation fund, starting in 2003. If passed
by the voters, this would earmark an additional $1.0 to $1.5 billion per year
for highway and mass transit projects in California, according to the California
Franchise Tax Board.

At the federal level, the Senate earlier this month approved its version
of FY2002 transportation appropriations bill. The measure would provide
approximately $60.0 billion for federal transportation programs, including $31.9
billion for the core federal highway program and $6.8 billion for the federal
transit program. Both investment levels exceed the Bush Administration's budget
request and the amounts guaranteed by TEA-21. The bill would also provide $3.3
billion for federal airport construction activities as required by AIR-21. The
House has passed its own version of the transportation appropriations bill with
similar funding levels and is expected to reconcile any differences with the
Senate version in a conference committee in the near future.

In summary, the Company's outlook for the short-term is for a reduction
in profitability in 2001 compared to the year 2000, but an increase in both
earnings and revenue in 2002, based on a large, quality backlog and strong
public sector funding going forward.

</TABLE>

Cash provided by operating activities of $10.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2001 represents a $6.5 million increase over the same
period in 2000. Changes in cash from operating activities primarily reflects
seasonal variations based on the amount and progress of work being performed.
Accounts Receivable at June 30, 2001 increased over the balance at December 31,
2000 due primarily to the Company's revenue growth in the latter half of the
second quarter of 2001 over the latter half of the fourth quarter of 2000.
Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings at June 30, 2001 increased
over the balance at December 31, 2000 due to cash timing differences on several
large projects in the early stages of construction.


17
<PAGE>   18

Cash used by investing activities for the six month period in 2001
increased $24.3 million over the corresponding 2000 period due primarily to
higher purchases of property and equipment and greater amounts invested in
short-term investments versus cash equivalents as well as the absence of the
$5.0 million proceeds from the second quarter 2000 TIC divestiture.

The Company generated cash from financing activities in the six months
ended June 30, 2001 due to additions to long-term debt which includes $75.0
million received in May 2001 under a new senior credit facility with a group of
institutional holders. The borrowing is due in nine equal annual installments
beginning in 2005 and bears interest at 6.96% per annum. The funds from this
borrowing will be used for general corporate purposes.

The Company has budgeted $58.3 million for capital expenditures in 2001,
which includes amounts for construction equipment, aggregate and asphalt plants,
buildings, leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate
reserves. The Company anticipates that cash generated internally and amounts
available under its existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its
capital and other requirements, including contributions to employee benefit
plans, for the foreseeable future. The Company currently has access to funds
under its revolving credit agreement which allow it to borrow up to $60.0
million, of which $48.4 million was available at June 30, 2001.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting and Standards Board ("FASB")
issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"),
"Business Combinations," and No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets." SFAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under a single method--the purchase method.
Use of the pooling-of-interests method is no longer permitted. SFAS 142 requires
that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for
impairment upon initial adoption of the Statement and on an annual basis going
forward. The amortization of goodwill will cease upon adoption of SFAS 142. The
provisions of SFAS 142 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of
adopting SFAS 141 and 142.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On July 1, 2001 the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Halmar
Builders of New York, Inc., a Mt. Vernon, New York heavy-civil construction
company ("Halmar") for a cash purchase price of approximately $19.0 million,
subject to final closing adjustments. The new entity will operate under the name
Granite Halmar Construction Company, Inc. ("Granite Halmar") as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Granite Construction Incorporated. If Granite Halmar achieves
certain predetermined financial results over a two-year period, the Company will
pay the former Halmar shareholders up to an additional $2.0 million.

Halmar is one of the largest heavy-civil construction firms operating in
the metropolitan New York City area. In 2000, Halmar had revenues of
approximately $200 million. The acquisition will be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting in accordance with the newly issued SFAS 141. The
Company is currently in the process of preparing the purchase price allocation
and determining the useful lives of the assets acquired.

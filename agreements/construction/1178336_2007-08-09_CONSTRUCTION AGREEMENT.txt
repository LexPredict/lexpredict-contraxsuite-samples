Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement








Cost Plus Incentive Construction Contract with JH Kelly LLCOn August 8, 2007, Hoku Materials, Inc. entered into a construction agreement, the Construction Agreement, with JH Kelly LLC., or JH Kelly, for construction services for the construction of a polysilicon production plant with an annual capacity of 2,000 metric tons.  We will pay JH Kelly on a time and materials basis plus a fee for its services and incentives if certain schedule, cost and safety targets are met.  The target cost for the services to be provided under the Construction Agreement is $120.0 million, including up to $5.0 million of incentives that may be payable.   The incentives are based on:

*        JH Kelly's total costs being less than $120.0 million,
*        JH Kelly achieving specified safety targets, and
*        JH Kelly meeting scheduled targets for:
*     pilot test production of polysilicon in late 2008,
*     mechanical completion by January 31, 2009, and
*     substantial project completion by May 31, 2009.  Each of these cost, safety and schedule targets may be adjusted if we or our other contractors cause any delays, or request changes to the work that increase the cost or time for completion, or if any delays caused by reasons not in the sole control of JH Kelly occur.


Pursuant to the Construct
ion Agreement, JH Kelly is not guaranteeing that the cost or schedule targets will be met, and we are obligated to pay for JH Kelly's services regardless of whether these targets are ultimately achieved; however, JH Kelly is required to pay liquidated damages of up to $1 million for construction schedule delays that are directly caused by the fault of JH Kelly. JH Kelly may terminate the Construction Agreement if we breach the agreement.  JH Kelly may suspend work under the Construction Agreement upon two days written notice if we fail to make any payment when due, and we will be liable for wind-down and start-up costs in the event JH Kelly restarts its performance of services . We may terminate the Construction Agreement if JH Kelly fails to perform its obligations or if JH Kelly becomes insolvent or bankrupt.  We may also terminate the Construction Agreement at any time for our convenience, in which case we are obligated to pay JH Kelly for all completed work, all work in progress and JH Kelly's reasona
ble termination expenses.
The Construction Agreement will be filed with Hoku Scientific's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2007.

shall be prepared in such form and supported by such data to substantiate its accuracy as the
Architect may require. This schedule, unless objected to by the Architect, shall be used as a basis
for reviewing the Contractor’s Applications for Payment.



§ 12.1.6 Applications for Payment shall show the percentage of completion of each portion of the
Work as of the end of the period covered by the Application for Payment. The percentage of
completion shall be the lesser of (1) the percentage of that portion of the Work which has actually
been completed; or (2) the percentage obtained by dividing (a) the expense that has actually been
incurred by the Contractor on account of that portion of the Work for which the Contractor has made
or intends to make actual payment prior to the next Application for Payment by (b) the share of the
Estimated Contract Sum Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion of the Work in the
schedule of values.



§ 12.1.7 Subject to other provisions of the Contract Documents, the amount of each progress
payment shall be computed as follows:




.1	 	take that portion of the Estimated Contract Sum Guaranteed Maximum Price
properly allocable to completed Work as determined by multiplying the percentage of
completion of each portion of the Work by the share of the Estimated Contract Sum
Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion of the Work in the schedule of
values. Pending final determination of cost to the Owner of changes in the Work,
amounts not in dispute shall be included as provided in Section 7.3.8 of AIA Document
A201-1997;

.2	 	add that portion of the Estimated Contract Sum Guaranteed Maximum Price
properly allocable to materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored at the
site for subsequent incorporation in the Work, or if approved in advance by the Owner,
suitably stored off the site at a location agreed upon in writing;

.3	 	add the Contractor’s Fee, less retainage of Ten percent (10%) of the
Contractor’s Fee allocated to the first fifty percent (50%) of the value of the Work
that is completed; after fifty percent (50%) of the Work is completed, retainage on
Contractor’s Fee shall be reduced to five percent (5%) of the Contractor’s Fee
allocated to the value of all Work that is completed to date. The Contractor’s Fee
shall be computed upon the Cost of the Work described in the two preceding Clauses at
the rate stated in Section 5.1.2 or, if the Contractor’s Fee is stated as a fixed sum
in that Subparagraph, shall be an amount that bears the same ratio to that fixed-sum
fee as the Cost of the Work in the two preceding Clauses bears to a reasonable
estimate of the probable Cost of the Work upon its completion;

.4	 	subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner;

.5	 	subtract the shortfall, if any, indicated by the Contractor in the
documentation required by Section 12.1.4 to substantiate prior Applications for
Payment, or resulting from errors subsequently discovered by the Owner’s accountants
in such documentation; and

.6	 	subtract amounts, if any, for which the Architect has withheld or nullified a
Certificate for Payment as provided in Section 9.5 of AIA Document A201-1997.





§
12.1.8 Except with the Owner’s prior approval.
pPayments to Subcontractors shall be subject to
retainage of not less than ten percent (10%) of the first fifty percent (50%) of the value of
the Work that is completed; after fifty percent (50%) of the Work is completed, retainage on the
payments to Subcontractors shall be reduced to five percent (5%) of the value of all Work that is
completed to date. Retainage may be further reduced on specific Subcontracts with approval of
Owner and Architect. The Owner and the Contractor shall agree upon a mutually acceptable
procedure for review and approval of payments and retention for Subcontractors.



§ 12.1.9 In taking action on the Contractor’s Applications for Payment, the Architect shall be
entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of the information furnished by the Contractor
and shall not be deemed to represent that the Architect has made a detailed examination, audit or
arithmetic verification of the documentation submitted in accordance with Section 12.1.4 or other
supporting data; that the Architect has made exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections or that
the Architect has made examinations to ascertain how or for what purposes the Contractor

has used amounts previously paid on account of the Contract. Such examinations, audits and
verifications, if required by the Owner, will be performed by the Owner’s accountants acting in the
sole interest of the Owner.



§ 12.2 FINAL PAYMENT




§ 12.2.1 Final payment, constituting the entire unpaid balance of the Contract Sum, shall be made
by the Owner to
the Contractor when:




.1	 	the Contractor has fully performed the Contract except for the Contractor’s
responsibility to correct Work (after final payment) as provided in Section 12.2.2 of
AIA Document A201-1997, and to satisfy other requirements, if any, which extend
beyond final payment; and

.2	 	a final Certificate for Payment has been issued by the Architect.





§ 12.2.2 The Owner’s final payment to the Contractor shall be made no later than 30 days after the
issuance of the Architect’s final Certificate for Payment,
or as follows:



§ 12.2.3 The Owner’s accountants will review and report in writing on the Contractor’s final
accounting within 30 days after delivery of the final accounting to the Architect by the
Contractor. Based upon such Cost of the Work as the Owner’s accountants report to be substantiated
by the Contractor’s final accounting, and provided the other
conditions of Section 12.2.1 have
been met, the Architect will, within seven days after receipt of the written report of the Owner’s
accountants, either issue to the Owner a final Certificate for Payment with a copy to the
Contractor, or notify the Contractor and Owner in writing of the Architect’s reasons for
withholding a certificate as provided in Section 9.5.1 of the AIA Document A201-1997. The time
periods stated in this Section 12.2.3 supersede those stated in Section 9.4.1 of the AIA Document
A201-1997.



§
12.2.4 If the Owner’s accountants report the Cost of the Work as substantiated by the
Contractor’s final accounting to be less than claimed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall be
entitled to demand arbitration of the disputed amount without a further decision of the Architect.
Such demand for arbitration shall be made by the Contractor within 30 days after the Contractor’s
receipt of a copy of the Architect’s final Certificate for Payment; failure to demand arbitration
within this 30-day period shall result in the substantiated amount reported by the Owner’s
accountants becoming binding on the Contractor. Pending a final resolution by arbitration, the
Owner shall pay the Contractor the amount certified in the Architect’s final Certificate for
Payment.



§ 12.2.5 If, subsequent to final payment and at the Owner’s request, the Contractor incurs costs
described in Article 7 and not excluded by Article 8 to correct defective or nonconforming Work,
the Owner shall reimburse the Contractor such costs and the Contractor’s Fee applicable thereto on
the same basis as if such costs had been incurred prior to final
payment., but not in excess of the
Guaranteed Maximum Price. If the Contractor has participated in savings as provided in Section
5.2, the amount of such savings shall he recalculated and appropriate credit given to the Owner in
determining the net amount to-be paid by the Owner to the Contractor.



ARTICLE 13 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION




§ 13.1 The Contract may be terminated by the Contractor, or by the Owner for convenience, as
provided in Article 14 of AIA Document A201-1997. However, the amount to be paid to the Contractor
under Section 14.1.3 of AIA Document A201-1997 shall not exceed the amount the Contractor would be
entitled to receive under Section 13.2 below, except that the Contractor’s Fee-shall be-calculated
as if the-Work had been-fully completed-by-the Contractor, including a reasonable estimate of the
Cost of the Work for Work not actually completed.



§ 13.2 The Contract may be terminated by the Owner for cause as provided in Article 14 of AIA
Document A201-1997. The amount, if any, to be paid to the Contractor under Section 14.2.4 of AIA
Document A201-1997 shall not cause the Guaranteed Maximum Price to be exceeded, nor shall it
exceed an amount calculated as follows:



§ 13.2.1 Take the Cost of the Work incurred by the Contractor to the date of termination;



§ 13.2.2 Add the Contractor’s Fee computed upon the Cost of the Work to the date of termination at
the rate stated in Section 5.1.2 or, if the Contractor’s Fee is stated as a fixed sum in that
Section, an amount that bears the same ratio to that fixed-sum Fee as the Cost of the Work at the
time of termination bears to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of the Work upon its
completion; and

§ 13.2.3 Subtract the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.



§ 13.3 The Owner shall also pay the Contractor fair compensation, either by purchase or rental at
the election of the Owner, for any equipment owned by the Contractor that the Owner elects to
retain and that is not otherwise included in the Cost of the Work under Section 13.2.1. To the
extent that the Owner elects to take legal assignment of subcontracts and purchase orders
(including rental agreements), the Contractor shall, as a condition of receiving the payments
referred to in this Article 13, execute and deliver all such papers and take all such steps,
including the legal assignment of such subcontracts and other contractual rights of the Contractor,
as the Owner may require for the purpose of fully vesting in the Owner the rights and benefits of
the Contractor under such subcontracts or purchase orders.



§ 13.4 The Work may be suspended by the Owner as provided in Article 14 of AIA Document A201-1997;
in such case, the Estimated Contract Sum Guaranteed Maximum Price and Contract Time shall be
increased as provided in Section 14.3.2 of AIA Document A201-1997 except that the term “profit”

specifically included in the Contract Documents as well as all additional items of work which
are reasonably inferable from that which is specified in order to complete the Work in
accordance with the Contract Documents. The Contract Documents are complementary, and what is
required by one shall be as binding as if required by all; performance by the Contractor shall
be required only to the extent consistent with the Contract Documents and reasonably inferable
from them as being necessary to produce the indicated results. Should any conflicts between
the requirements of the Drawings and the Specifications, or any differences within the
Drawings themselves or within the Specifications themselves, be discovered or develop, the
Architect shall decide which of the conflicting requirements will govern and the Contractor
shall perform the Work in accordance with the Architect’s decision. Conflicts or differences
which, based upon the Architect’s determination, result in an increase or decrease in cost
shall be considered a change in the Work and shall be governed by Article 7.



§ 1.2.2 Organization of the Specifications into divisions, sections and articles, and
arrangement of Drawings shall not
control the Contractor in dividing the Work among Subcontractors or in establishing the extent
of Work to be
performed by any trade.



§ 1.2.3 Unless otherwise stated in the Contract Documents, words and abbreviations which have
well-known
technical or construction industry meanings are used in the Contract Documents in accordance
with such recognized
meanings.

the choice shall be
the Contractor’s. Contractor may, after notifying the Architect and Owner, select the one it
considers to be the best.
Approval by Architect or Owner of materials, suppliers, processes, or Subcontractors does not
imply a waiver of any
Contract requirements including, without limitation, Contractor’s warranty.



1.2.5 All Work shall conform to the Contract Documents. No change therefrom shall be made
without review and
written acceptance by Architect and Owner.

one statement and appears
in another is not intended to affect the interpretation of either statement.



§ 1.5 EXECUTION OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS



§ 1.5.1 The Contract Documents shall be signed by the Owner and Contractor. If either the Owner or
Contractor or
both do not sign all the Contract Documents, the Architect shall identify such unsigned Documents

visited the site,
become generally familiar with local conditions under which the Work is to be performed and
correlated personal
observations with requirements of the Contract Documents. Execution of the Contract by the
Contractor is a
representation that said Contract Documents are sufficient to have enabled the Contractor to
determine the Estimated
Contract Sum therein, to enter into the Contract and construct the Work outlined therein, and
otherwise to fulfill its
obligations hereunder, including, but not limited to, Contractor’s obligations to construct the
Work on or before the
date(s) of Substantial Completion established in the Agreement. The Contractor further
acknowledges and declares
that it has visited and examined the site. In connection therewith, Contractor specifically
represents and warrants to
Owner that it has, by careful examination, satisfied itself as to: (1) the nature, location,
and character of the project
and the site, (2) the nature, location, and character of the general area in which the Project
is located, including
without limitation, its climatic conditions, available labor supply and labor costs, and
available equipment supply
and equipment costs; and (3) the quality and quantity of all materials, supplies, tools,
equipment, labor, and
professional services necessary to complete the Work in the manner and within the costs and
time frame required by
the Contract Documents.



In connection with the foregoing, and having carefully examined all Contract Documents, as
aforesaid, and having
visited the site, the Contractor acknowledges and declares that it has no knowledge of any
discrepancies, omissions,
ambiguities, or conflicts in said Contract Documents and that if it becomes aware of any such
discrepancies,
omissions, ambiguities, or conflicts, it will promptly notify Owner and Architect of such fact.



Further, Contractor recognizes the extra degree of care required under the urban site
construction circumstances with
respect to safety, protection of pedestrians, cleanliness of the site, health and other laws,
and protections of existing
utilities, adjacent streets, and property. In arriving at the Estimated Contract Sum and the
Contract Time, Contractor
has, as an experienced and prudent contractor, exercised its best judgment upon the Estimated
Contract Sum and the
Contract Time.

§
2.3.1 If the Contractor fails to correct Work which is not in accordance with the requirements
of the Contract
Documents as required by Section 12.2 or persistently fails to carry out Work in accordance

procedures. The Architect’s approval of a specific item shall not indicate approval of an
assembly of which the item is a component.

§ 4.3 CLAIMS AND DISPUTES




§ 4.3.1 Definition. A Claim is a demand or assertion by one of the parties seeking, as a matter of
right, adjustment or interpretation of Contract terms, payment of money, extension of time or
other relief with respect to the terms of the Contract. The term “Claim” also includes other
disputes and matters in question between the Owner and Contractor arising out of or relating to
the Contract. Claims must be initiated by written notice. The responsibility to substantiate
Claims shall rest with the party making the Claim.



§
4.3.2 Time Limits on Claims. Claims by either party must be initiated within 21 days after
occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claim or within 21 days after the claimant first
recognizes the condition giving rise to the Claim, whichever is later. Claims must be initiated by
written notice to the Architect and the other party.



§ 4.3.3 Continuing Contract Performance. Pending final resolution of a Claim except as otherwise
agreed in writing or as provided in Section 9.7.1 and Article 14, the Contractor shall proceed
diligently with performance of the Contract and the Owner shall continue to make payments in
accordance with the Contract Documents.



§ 4.3.4 Claims for Concealed or Unknown Conditions. If conditions are encountered at the site which
are (1) subsurface or otherwise concealed physical conditions which differ materially from those
indicated in the Contract Documents or (2) unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature,  which
differ materially from those ordinarily found to exist and generally recognized as tnherent in
construction activities-of-the-character provided for in the Contract
Documents,  then notice by the
observing party shall be given to the other party promptly before conditions are disturbed and in
no event later than 21 days after first observance of the conditions. The Architect will promptly
investigate such conditions and, if they differ materially and cause an increase or decrease in
the Contractor’s cost of, or time required for, performance of any part of the Work, will
recommend an equitable adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, or both. If the Architect
determines that the conditions at the site are not materially different from those indicated in
the Contract Documents and that no change in the terms of the Contract is justified, the Architect
shall so notify the Owner and Contractor in writing, stating the reasons. Claims by either party
in opposition to such determination must be made within 21 days after :he Architect has given
notice of the decision. If the conditions encountered are materially different, the Contract Sum
and Contract Time shall be equitably adjusted,

but if the
Owner and Contractor cannot agree on an adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract
Time, the adjustment shall be referred to the Architect for initial determination, subject to
further proceedings pursuant to Section 4.4.



§ 4.3.5 Claims for Additional Cost. If the Contractor wishes to make Claim for an increase in the
Contract Sum, written notice as provided herein shall be given before proceeding to execute the
Work. Said notice shall itemize all claims and shall contain sufficient detail and substantiating
data to permit evaluation of same by Owner and Architect. No such claim shall be valid unless so
made. Prior notice is not required for Claims relating to an emergency endangering life or
property arising under Section 10.6.



§ 4.3.6 If the Contractor believes additional cost is involved for reasons including but not
limited to (1) a written interpretation from the Architect, (2) an order by the Owner to stop the
Work where the Contractor was not at fault, (3) a written order for a minor change in the Work
issued by the Architect, (4) failure of payment by the Owner, (5) termination of the Contract by
the Owner, (6) Owner’s suspension or (7) other reasonable grounds. Claim shall be filed in
accordance with this Section 4.3. Any change in the Estimated Contract Sum resulting from such
claim shall be authorized by Change Order or Construction Change Directive, as the case may be.

and of probable effect of delay on progress of the Work. In the case of a continuing delay only
one Claim is necessary.



§ 4.3.7.2 If adverse weather conditions are the basis for a Claim for additional time, such Claim
shall be documented by data substantiating that weather conditions were abnormal for the period of
time, could not have been reasonably anticipated and had an adverse effect on the scheduled
construction.



§ 4.3.8 Injury or Damage to Person or Properly. Subject to the parties’ obligations and
responsibilities under the Contract Documents in general and Article 11 hereof in particular, if
either party to the Contract suffers injury or damage to person or property because of an act or
omission of the other party, or of others for whose acts such party is legally responsible,
written notice of such injury or damage, whether or not insured, shall be given to the other party
within a reasonable time not exceeding 21 days after discovery. The notice shall provide
sufficient detail to enable the other party to investigate the matter.



§ 4.3.9 If unit prices are stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed upon, and if
quantities originally contemplated are materially changed in a proposed Change Order or
Construction Change Directive so that application of such unit prices to quantities of Work
proposed will cause substantial inequity to the Owner or Contractor, the applicable unit prices
shall be equitably adjusted.



§
4.3.10 Claims for Consequential Damages. The Contractor and Owner waive Claims against each other
for consequential damages arising out of or relating to this Contract. This mutual waiver

decision
having been rendered by-the Architect. The Architect will not decide disputes-between
the Contractor and persons or entities other-than the Owner.



§ 4.4.2 The Architect (if the matter is referred to the Architect for initial decision) will
review Claims and within ten days of the receipt of the Claim take one or more of the following
actions: (1) request additional supporting data from the claimant or a response with supporting
data from the other party, (2) reject the Claim in whole or in part, (3) approve the Claim, (4)
suggest a compromise, or (5) advise the parties that the Architect is unable to resolve the
Claim if the Architect lacks sufficient information to evaluate the merits of the Claim or if
the Architect concludes that, in the Architect’s sole discretion, it would be inappropriate for
the Architect to resolve the Claim.



§ 4.4.3 In evaluating Claims (if the matter is referred to Architect for initial decision), the
Architect may, but shall not be obligated to, consult with or seek information from either party
or from persons with special knowledge or expertise who may assist the Architect in rendering a
decision. The Architect may request the Owner to authorize retention of such persons at the
Owner’s expense.



§ 4.4.4 If the Architect requests a party to provide a response to a Claim or to furnish
additional supporting data, such party shall respond, within ten days after receipt of such
request, and shall either provide a response on the requested supporting data, advise the
Architect when the response or supporting data will be furnished or advise the Architect that no
supporting data will be furnished. Upon receipt of the response or supporting data, if any, the
Architect will either reject or approve the Claim in whole or in part.



§ 4.4.5 The Architect will approve or reject Claims (if the matter is referred to Architect for
initial decision) by written decision, which shall state the reasons therefor and which shall
notify the parties of any change in the Contract Sum or Contract Time or both. The approval or
rejection of a Claim by the Architect shall be final and binding on the parties but subject to
mediation and-arbitration.



§
4.4.6 When a written-decision of the Architect states that (1) the decision is final but
subject to mediation and arbitration and (2) a demand for arbitration of a Claim-covered by such
decision must be made within 30 days after the date on which the party making-the-demand receives
the final written decision, then failure to demand arbitration within said 30 days’ period-shall
result in the Architect’s decision becoming-final-and-binding upon the Owner and Contractor. If
the Architect renders a decision after arbitration-proceedings have been initiated, such decision
may be entered as evidence, but shall not supersede arbitration-proceedings unless the decision
is acceptable to all parties concerned.



§ 4.4.67 Upon receipt of a Claim against the Contractor or at any time thereafter, the Architect
or the Owner may, but is not obligated to, notify the surety, if any, of the nature and amount of
the Claim. If the Claim relates to a possibility of a Contractor’s default, the Architect or the
Owner may, but is not obligated to, notify the surety and request the surety’s assistance in
resolving the controversy.



§
4.4.78 If a Claim relates to or is the subject of a
mechanic’s lien, the party asserting such
Claim may proceed in accordance with applicable law to comply with the lien notice or filing
deadlines prior to resolution of the Claim by the Architect, by mediation or by arbitration.



4.4.89
Neither the Owner nor the Contractor shall be required to initiate or participate in
mediation with respect to claims, disputes or other matters in question between the
parties to this Contract arising out of or relating to the Contract
or breach thereof. If the
parties should mutually determine to participate in mediation, such dispute resolution shall
be conducted in accordance with Section 4.5.

submission of the Claim to the Architect, be subject to mediation as a condition precedent to
arbitration or the institution of legal or equitable proceedings by either party.



§
4.5.2 The parties shall endeavor to resolve their Claims by
mediation which, unless the parties
mutually agree otherwise, shall be in accordance with the Construction Industry Mediation Rules
of the American Arbitration Association currently in effect. Request for mediation shall be filed
in writing with the other party to the Contract

from the date of filing, unless stayed for a longer period by
agreement of the parties or court
order.



§ 4.5.3 The parties shall share the mediator’s fee and any filing fees equally. The mediation shall
be held in the place where the Project is located, unless another location is mutually agreed
upon. Agreements reached in mediation shall be enforceable as settlement agreements in any court
having jurisdiction thereof.

effect and except those waived as provided for in
Sections 4.3.10, 9.10.4 and 9.10.5, shall, after

required if complete relief is to be accorded in arbitration. No person or entity other than the
Owner, Contractor or a separate contractor as described in Article 6 shall be included as an
original third party or additional third party to an arbitration whose interest or responsibility
is insubstantial. Consent to arbitration involving an additional person or entity shall not
constitute consent to arbitration of a Claim not described therein or with a person or entity not
named or described therein. The foregoing agreement to arbitrate and other agreements to arbitrate
with an additional person or entity duly consented to by parties to the Agreement shall be
specifically enforceable under applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

materials or equipment fabricated to a special design) proposed for each principal portion of the
Work. The Architect will promptly reply to the Contractor in writing stating whether or not the
Owner or the Architect, after due investigation, has  reasonable objection to any such proposed
person or entity. Failure of the Owner or Architect to reply promptly shall constitute notice of no
reasonable objection.



§ 5.2.2 The Contractor shall not contract with a proposed person or entity to whom the Owner or
Architect has made reasonable-and timely  objection. The Contractor shall not be required to
contract with anyone to whom the Contractor has made reasonable objection.

safety of the Subcontractor’s Work, which the Contractor, by these Documents, assumes toward the
Owner and Architect. Each subcontract agreement shall preserve and protect the rights of the Owner
and Architect under the Contract Documents with respect to the Work to be performed by the
Subcontractor so that subcontracting thereof will not prejudice such rights, and shall allow to
the Subcontractor, unless specifically provided otherwise in the subcontract agreement, the
benefit of all rights, remedies and redress against the Contractor that the Contractor, by the
Contract Documents, has against the Owner. Where appropriate, the Contractor shall require each
Subcontractor to enter into similar agreements with Sub-subcontractors. The Contractor shall make
available to each proposed Subcontractor, prior to the execution of the subcontract agreement,
copies of the Contract Documents to which the Subcontractor will be bound, and, upon written
request of the Subcontractor, identify to the Subcontractor terms and conditions of the proposed

for compensation accruing to such party(ies) for Work done or materials delivered from and after
the date on which Owner determines to accept the subcontract agreement(s) or purchase order(s). All
sums due and owing by Contractor to the designated Subcontractor(s) or supplier(s) for work
performed or material supplied prior to Owner’s determination to accept the subcontract
agreement(s) or purchase order(s) shall constitute a debt between such parties and Contractor, but
only if Owner has reimbursed Contractor for such costs. It is further agreed that all subcontractor
agreements and purchase orders shall provide that they are freely assignable by Contractor to Owner
and assigns under the terms and conditions stated hereinabove. It is further agreed and understood
that such assignment is part of the consideration to Owner for entering into the Contract with
Contractor and may not be withdrawn prior to Final Completion. Contractor shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Owner a written acknowledgment in form and substance satisfactory to Owner from
each of its Subcontractors and suppliers of the contingent assignment described herein no later
than ten (10) days after the date of execution of each subcontract agreement and purchase order
with such parties. Each subcontract agreement for a portion of the Work is assigned by the
Contractor to the Owner provided that:



.1    assignment is effective-only after-termination of the Contract by the Owner
For-cause-pursuant -to Section 14.2 and only for those subcontract agreements which
the Owner accepts by notifying the Subcontractor and Contractor in writing; and





.2    assignment is subject to the prior rights of the surety, if any, obligated under bond
relating to the contract.



§
5.4.2 Upon such assignment, if the Work has been suspended for more than 30 days, the

with the Owner’s own forces, and to award separate contracts in connection with other portions of
the Project or other construction or operations on the site under Conditions of the Contract
identical or substantially similar to these including those portions related to insurance and
waiver of subrogation. The Contractor acknowledges the Owner’s intent to cause the work to be
performed by others and that a portion of such work may take place before Substantial Completion
by the Contractor. The Contractor shall afford such parties ample access to the site and all areas
of the Work as may be reasonably necessary for the performance of such work including, without
limitation, storage of materials and equipment, vertical transportation, and connection to

withholding
certification in whole or in part as provided in Section 9.5.1.



§ 9.4.2 The issuance of a Certificate for Payment will constitute a representation by the
Architect to the Owner

Payment, and on all
other information available to the Architect including, without limitation, that the Work has
progressed to the point
indicated and that, to the best of the Architect’s knowledge, information and belief, the
quality of the Work is in
accordance with the Contract Documents and that all lien waivers and certificates required
under the Contract
Documents have been furnished to the Architect in proper form. The foregoing representations

conformance—with the Contract Documents upon Substantial Completion, to results of—subsequent
tests and
inspections-, to correction of minor deviations from the Contract Documents prior to completion

qualifications expressed by the Architect. The issuance of a Certificate for Payment will
further constitute a
representation that the Contractor is entitled to payment in the amount certified. However, the

Certificate for Payment will not be a representation that the Architect has (1) made exhaustive
or continuous on site
inspections to check the quality or quantity of the Work, (2) reviewed construction means,
methods, techniques,
sequences or procedures, (3) reviewed copies of requisitions received from Subcontractors and
material suppliers

be made. If the Architect is unable to certify payment in the amount of the Application, the
Architect will notify the
Contractor and Owner as provided in Section 9.4.1. If the Contractor and Architect cannot agree
on a revised
amount, the Architect will promptly issue a Certificate for Payment for the amount for which

make such representations to the Owner. The Architect may also withhold a Certificate for
Payment or, because of
subsequently discovered evidence, may nullify the whole or a part of a Certificate for Payment

such Subcontractor’s portion of the Work. The Contractor shall, by appropriate agreement
with each Subcontractor,
require each Subcontractor to make payments to Sub-subcontractors in a similar manner.



§ 9.6.3 The Architect will, on request, furnish to a Subcontractor, if practicable,
information regarding percentages of
completion or amounts applied for by the Contractor and action taken thereon by the
Architect and Owner on
account of portions of the Work done by such Subcontractor.



§ 9.6.4 Neither the Owner nor Architect shall have an obligation to pay or to see to the
payment of money to a
Subcontractor except as may otherwise be required by law.



§ 9.6.5 Payment to material suppliers shall be treated in a manner similar to that provided
in Sections 9.6.2, 9.6.3 and
9.6.4.



§ 9.6.6 A Certificate for Payment, a progress payment, or partial or entire use or
occupancy of the Project by the
Owner shall not constitute acceptance of Work not in accordance with the Contract
Documents.



§ 9.6.7 Unless the Contractor provides the Owner with a payment bond in the full penal sum
of the Contract Sum,
payments received by the Contractor for Work properly performed by Subcontractors and
suppliers shall be held by
the Contractor for those Subcontractors or suppliers who performed Work or furnished
materials, or both, under
contract with the Contractor for which payment was made by the Owner. Nothing contained
herein shall require
money to be placed in a separate account and not commingled with money of the Contractor,
shall create any
fiduciary liability or tort liability on the part of the Contractor for breach of trust or
shall entitle any person or entity
to an award of punitive damages against the Contractor for breach of the requirements of
this provision.



§ 9.7 FAILURE OF PAYMENT



§
9.7.1 If the Architect does not issue a Certificate for Payment, through no fault of the
Contractor, within seven days
after receipt of the Contractor’s Application for Payment, or if the Owner does not pay the
Contractor within seven
days after the date established in the Contract Documents the amount certified by the
Architect or awarded by
arbitration, then the Contractor may, upon seven additional days’ written notice to the
Owner and Architect, stop the
Work until payment of the amount owing has been received. The Contract Time shall be
extended appropriately and
the Contract Sum shall be increased by the amount of the Contractor’s reasonable costs of
shut-down, delay and
start-up, plus interest as provided for in the Contract Documents.



§ 9.8 SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION



§
9.8.1 Substantial Completion is the stage in the progress of the Work when the Work or
designated portion thereof
(which the Owner agrees to accept separately) is sufficiently complete in accordance with
the Contract Documents
so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work for its intended use. The Work will not be
considered suitable for
Substantial Completion review until all Project systems included in the Work are
operational as designed and
scheduled, all designated or required governmental inspections and certifications required
for occupancy, which may
consist of a temporary or partial certificate of occupancy, have been made and posted, and
designated instruction of
Owner’s personnel in the operation of system has been completed. In general, the only
remaining Work shall be
minor in nature, so that the Owner or Owner’s tenants could occupy the building on that
date and the completion of
the Work by the Contractor would not materially interfere or hamper the Owner’s or Owner’s
tenants’ (or those
claiming by, through or under Owner) normal business operations. As a further condition of
Substantial Completion
acceptance, the Contractor shall certify that all remaining Work will be completed within
thirty (30) consecutive
calendar days except those items that are weather-dependent, or as agreed upon in writing
with Owner following the
Date of Substantial Completion.



§ 9.8.2 When the Contractor considers that the Work, or a portion thereof which the Owner
agrees to accept
separately, is substantially complete, the Contractor shall prepare and submit to the
Architect a comprehensive list of
items to be completed or corrected prior to final payment. The Contractor shall proceed
promptly to complete and
correct items on the list. Failure to include an item on such list does not alter the
responsibility of the Contractor to
complete all Work in accordance with the Contract Documents.



§ 9.8.3 Upon receipt of the Contractor’s list, the Architect will make an inspection to
determine whether the Work or
designated portion thereof (which the Owner agrees to accept separately) is substantially
complete. If the Architect’s
inspection discloses any item, whether or not included on the Contractor’s list, which is
not sufficiently complete in
accordance with the Contract Documents so that the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work or
designated portion

thereof for its intended use, the Contractor shall, before issuance of the Certificate of
Substantial Completion,
complete or correct such item upon notification by the Architect. In such case, the Contractor
shall then submit a
request for another inspection by the Architect to determine Substantial Completion.



§ 9.8.4 When the Work or designated portion thereof (Which the Owner agrees to accept
separately) is substantially
complete, the Architect will prepare a Certificate of Substantial Completion which shall
establish the date of
Substantial Completion, shall establish responsibilities of the Owner and Contractor for
security, maintenance, heat,
utilities, damage to the Work and insurance, and shall fix the time within which the Contractor
shall finish all items
on the list accompanying the Certificate, Warranties required by the Contract Documents shall
commence on the
date of Substantial Completion of the Work or designated portion thereof (which the Owner
agrees to accept
separately) unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Substantial Completion.



§
9.8.5 The Certificate of Substantial Completion shall be submitted to the Owner and
Contractor for their written
acceptance of responsibilities assigned to them in such Certificate. Upon such acceptance (by
both Owner and
Contractor) and consent of surety, if any, the Owner shall make payment of retainage applying
to such Work or
designated portion thereof. Such payment shall be adjusted for reduced by 150% of the value
of Work that is
incomplete or not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents. Final
payment of such withheld
sum shall be made upon correction or completion of such Work.



§ 9.9 PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OR USE



§ 9.9.1 The Owner may occupy or use any completed or partially completed portion of the Work at
any stage when
such portion is designated by separate agreement with the Contractor, provided such occupancy
or use is consented
to by the insurer as required under Section 11.4.1.45 and authorized by public authorities
having jurisdiction over
the Work. Such partial occupancy or use may commence whether or not the portion is
substantially complete,
provided the Owner and Contractor have accepted in writing the responsibilities assigned to
each of them for
payments, retainage, if any, security, maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and
insurance, and have
agreed in writing concerning the period for correction of the Work and commencement of
warranties required by the
Contract Documents. When the Contractor considers a portion substantially complete, the
Contractor shall prepare
and submit a list to the Architect as provided under Section 9.8.2. Consent of the Contractor
to partial occupancy or
use shall not be unreasonably withheld. The stage of the progress of the Work shall be
determined by written
agreement between the Owner and Contractor or, if no agreement is reached, by decision of the
Architect.



§
9.9.2 Immediately prior to such partial occupancy or use, the Owner, Contractor and Architect
shall jointly inspect
the area to be occupied or portion of the Work to be used in order to determine and record the
condition of the
Work. In the event of Partial Occupancy, the Contractor shall promptly secure endorsement from
its insurance
carrier(s), consent from its surety(ies), if any, and consent from public authorities having
jurisdiction over the Work
permitting Partial Occupancy.



§
9.9.3 Unless otherwise agreed upon, partial occupancy or use of a portion or portions of the
Work shall not
constitute acceptance of Work not complying with the requirements of the Contract Documents.
In the event of
Partial Occupancy before Substantial Completion as provided above, the Contractor shall
cooperate with the Owner
in making available for the Owner’s use and benefit such building services that may be
operational at the time of
Partial Occupancy such as heating, ventilating, cooling, water, lighting, telephone, elevators
and security for the
portion or portions to be occupied, and if the Work required to furnish such services is not
entirely completed at the
time the Owner desires to occupy the aforesaid portion or portions, the Contractor shall make
every reasonably
effort to complete such Work or make temporary provisions for such Work as soon as possible so
that the
aforementioned building services may be put into operation and use.



9.9.4 In the event of Partial Occupancy prior to Substantial Completion, mutually acceptable
arrangements shall be
made between the Owner and Contractor in respect of the operation and cost of necessary
security, maintenance and
utilities, including heating, ventilating, cooling, water, lighting and telephone services and
elevators. This includes
the cost of extended warranties that the Contractor needs to secure from its subcontractors and
suppliers to cover the
period from Partial Occupancy to Final Occupancy. The Owner shall assume proportionate and
reasonable
responsibility for the cost of the above services. Further, mutually acceptable arrangements
shall be made between
the Owner and Contractor in respect of insurance and damage of the Work. Contractor’s
acceptance of
arrangements proposed by Owner in respect of such matters shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or
conditioned.

9.9.5 In each instance, when the Owner elects to exercise its right of Partial Occupancy as
described herein, Owner
will give Contractor and Architect advance written notice of its election to take the portion or
portions involved, and
immediately prior to Partial Occupancy, the Owner, Contractor and Architect shall jointly inspect the area to be
occupied or portion of the Work to be used to determine and record the conditions of the same.



9.9.6 It shall be understood, however, that Partial Occupancy shall not: (1) constitute final acceptance of any Work
(2) relieve the Contractor for responsibility for loss or damage became of or arising out
of defects in, or
malfunctioning of, any Work, material, or equipment, nor from any other unfulfilled obligations or
responsibilities
under the Contract Documents or (3) commence any warranty period other than the extended warranties described in
Section 9.9.4 under the Contract Documents; provided that Contractor shall not be liable for ordinary wear and tear
resulting from such Partial Occupancy.



9.9.7 Subject to the terms and conditions provided herein, if the Contractor claims that delay or additional cost is
involved because of Partial Occupancy by the Owner, Contractor shall make such claim as provided
elsewhere in
the Contract Documents.



§ 9.10 FINAL COMPLETION AND FINAL PAYMENT



§ 9.10.1 Upon receipt of written notice that the Work is ready for final inspection and
acceptance and upon receipt of
a final Application for Payment, the Architect will promptly make such inspection and, when the
Architect finds the
Work acceptable under the Contract Documents and the Contract fully performed, the Architect
will promptly issue
a final Certificate for Payment stating that to the best of the Architect’s knowledge,
information and belief, and on
the basis of the Architect’s on-site visits and inspections, the Work has been completed in
accordance with terms
and conditions of the Contract Documents and that the entire balance found to be due the
Contractor and noted in
the final Certificate is due and payable. The Architect’s final Certificate for Payment will
constitute a further
representation that conditions listed in Section 9.10.2 as precedent to the Contractor’s being
entitled to final payment
have been fulfilled.



§
9.10.2 Neither final payment nor any remaining retained percentage shall become due until the
Contractor submits
to the Architect (1) an affidavit that payrolls, bills for materials and equipment, and other
indebtedness connected
with the Work for which the Owner or the Owner’s property might be responsible or encumbered
(less amounts
withheld by Owner) have been paid or otherwise satisfied, (2) a certificate evidencing that
insurance required by the
Contract Documents to remain in force after final payment is currently in effect and will not
be canceled or allowed
to expire until at least 30 days’ prior written notice has been given to the Owner, (3) a
written statement satisfactory
to the Owner that the Contractor knows of no substantial reason that the insurance will not be
renewable to cover the
period required by the Contract Documents, (4) consent of surety, if any, to final payment and
(5), if required by the
Owner, other data establishing payment or satisfaction of obligations, such as receipts,
releases and waivers of liens,
claims, security interests or encumbrances arising out of the Contract, to the extent and in
such form as may be
designated by the Owner, and the Owner’s lender and (6) evidence of compliance with all
requirements of the
Contract Documents and all notices, certificates, affidavits, other requirements to complete
Contractor’s obligations
under the Contract Documents: including but not limited to (a) instruction of Owner’s
representatives in the
operation of mechanical, electrical, plumbing and other systems, (b) delivery of keys to Owner

assignment thereof
prepared in duplicate, certificates of inspections, and bonds for Architect’s review and
delivery to Owner, (d) deliver
to Architect of printed or typewritten operating, servicing, maintenance and cleaning
instructions for all Work; parts
lists and special tools for mechanical and electrical Work in approved form, (e) delivery to

materials and services,
executed by an authorized officer and duly notarized. In addition to the foregoing, all other
submissions required by
other articles and paragraphs of the Specifications including final construction schedule shall
be submitted to the
Architect before approval of final payment. If a Subcontractor refuses to furnish a release or
waiver required by the
Owner, the Contractor may furnish a bond satisfactory to the Owner to indemnify the Owner
against such lien. In
lieu of a bond, Contractor may furnish to the Owner the Contractor’s indemnification
satisfactory to the Owner or a

Work in the affected area and report the condition to the Owner and Architect in writing.



§
10.3.2 The Owner shall obtain the services of a licensed laboratory to verify the presence
or absence of the material
or substance reported by the Contractor and, in the event such material or substance is found

the Contractor or
anyone under contract with the Contractor, except for such materials or substances required by
the Contract
Documents, and such material or substance presents the risk of bodily injury or death as

ARTICLE 12 UNCOVERING AND CORRECTION OF WORK



§ 12.1 UNCOVERING OF WORK



§ 12.1.1 If a portion of the Work is covered contrary to the Architect’s request or to requirements
specifically
expressed in the Contract Documents, it must, if required in writing by the Architect, be uncovered
for the
Architect’s examination and be replaced at the Contractor’s expense without change in the Contract
Time or
Contract Sum.



§
12.1.2 If a portion of the Work has been covered which the Architect has not specifically
requested to examine
prior to its being covered, the Architect may request to see such Work and it shall be
uncovered by the Contractor. If
such Work is in accordance with the Contract Documents, costs of uncovering and replacement
shall, by appropriate
Change Order, be at the Owner’s expense. If such Work is not in accordance with the Contract
Documents,
correction shall be at the Contractor’s expense unless the condition was caused by the Owner or
a separate
contractor in which event the Owner shall be responsible for payment of such costs.



§ 12.2 CORRECTION OF WORK



§ 12.2.1 BEFORE OR AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION



§12.2.1.1 The Contractor shall promptly correct Work rejected by the Architect or failing to
conform to the
requirements of the Contract Documents, whether discovered before or after Substantial Completion
and whether or
not fabricated, installed or completed. Costs of correcting such rejected Work, including
additional testing and
inspections and compensation for the Architect’s services and expenses made necessary thereby,
shall be at the
Contractor’s expense.



§ 12.2.2 AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION



§12.2.2.1 In addition to the Contractor’s
obligations under Section 3.5, if, within one year
after the date of
Substantial Completion of the entire Work (unless otherwise provided in any Certificates of
partial Substantial
Completion approved by the parties), or within such longer period of time as may be prescribed
by law or in equity,
or designated portion thereof or after the date for commencement of warranties established
under Section 9.9.1, or
by terms of an applicable special warranty required by the Contract Documents, any of the Work
is found to be
defective or otherwise not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the
Contractor shall
correct it promptly after receipt of written notice from the Owner to do so unless the Owner
has previously given the
Contractor a written acceptance of such condition. The Owner shall give such notice promptly
after discovery of the
condition. During the one-year period for correction of Work, if the Owner fails to notify the
Contractor and give the
Contractor an opportunity to make the correction, the Owner waives the rights to require
correction by the
Contractor and to make a claim for breach of warranty. If the Contractor fails to correct
nonconforming Work within
a reasonable time during that period after receipt of notice from the Owner or Architect, the
Owner may correct it in
accordance with Section 2.4.

§ 12.2.2.2 The one-year period for correction of Work shall be extended with respect to
portions of Work first
performed after Substantial Completion by the period of time between Substantial Completion
and the actual
performance of the Work.



§
12.2.2.3 The one-year period for correction of Work shall not be extended by corrective
Work performed by the
Contractor pursuant to this Section 12.2. Corrective Work first performed after Substantial
Completion shall be
warranted to be free from defects for a period equal to the longer of six (6) months after
the completion of the
corrective Work or one (1) year after the Date of Substantial
Completion. Any defect in such
corrective Work shall
be corrected again by Contractor promptly upon notice of the defect
from the Owner. This
obligation shall survive
acceptance of the Work under the Contract.

or otherwise not in
accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents and are neither corrected by the
Contractor nor
accepted by the Owner.



§ 12.2.4 The Contractor shall bear the cost of correcting destroyed or damaged
construction, whether completed or
partially completed, of the Owner or separate contractors caused in whole or in part by the
Contractor’s correction or
removal of Work which is defective or otherwise not in accordance with the requirements of
the Contract
Documents.



§ 12.2.5 Nothing contained in this Section 12.2 shall be construed to establish a period of
limitation with respect to
other obligations which the Contractor might have under the Contract Documents or under law
or in equity.
Establishment of the one-year period for correction of Work as described in Section 12.2.2
relates only to the
specific obligation of the Contractor to correct the Work, and has no relationship to the
time within which the
obligation to comply with the Contract Documents may be sought to be enforced, nor to the
time within which
proceedings may be commenced to establish the Contractor’s liability with respect to the
Contractor’s obligations
other than specifically to correct the Work.



§ 12.3 ACCEPTANCE OF NONCONFORMING WORK



§ 12.3.1 If the Owner prefers to accept Work which is defective or otherwise not in
accordance with the requirements
of the Contract Documents, the Owner may do so instead of requiring its removal and
correction, in which case the
Contract Sum will be reduced as appropriate and equitable. Such adjustment shall be
effected whether or not final
payment has been made.



ARTICLE 13 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



§13.1 GOVERNING LAW



§

assigns and legal
representatives to the other party hereto and to partners, successors, assigns and legal
representatives of such other
party in respect to covenants, agreements and obligations contained in the Contract
Documents. Except as provided
in Section 13.2.2, neither party to the Contract shall assign the Contract as a whole
without written consent of the

shall nevertheless remain
legally responsible for all obligations under the Contract.

institutional lender providing
construction financing for the Project. In such event, the lender shall assume the Owner’s
rights and obligations
under the Contract Documents. The Contractor shall execute all consents reasonably required
to facilitate such
assignment. The Contractor shall comply with all reasonable requests from the Owner’s
lender; however, consent or
approval must not require the Contractor to subordinate its lien rights; must not
increase the scope of the
Contractor’s obligations under this Contract, must not decrease the scope of the
Contractor’s rights under this Contract and must be consistent with lending practices typical of institutional lenders
for commercial real estate development in the metropolitan Chicago area.

§ 13.5 TESTS AND INSPECTIONS



§ 13.5.1 Tests, inspections and approvals of portions of the Work required by the Contract
Documents or by laws,
ordinances, rules, regulations or orders of public authorities having jurisdiction shall be
made at an appropriate time.
Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall make arrangements for such tests, inspections
and approvals with an
independent testing laboratory or entity acceptable to the Owner, or with the appropriate
public authority, and shall
bear all related costs of tests, inspections and approvals. The Contractor shall give the
Architect and Owner timely
notice of when and where tests and inspections are to be made so that the Architect and Owner
may be present for
such procedures. The Owner shall bear costs of tests, inspections or approvals which not become
requirements
until after bids are received or negotiations concluded. The Architect, Owner, and Contractor
shall be afforded a
reasonable opportunity to attend, observe, and witness all inspections and tests of the Work.
The Architect or
Owner may at any time request and receive from Contractor satisfactory evidence that materials,
supplies, or
equipment are in conformance with the Contract Documents. The conduct of any inspection or test
and the receipt
of any approval shall not operate to relieve the Contractor from its obligations under the
Contract Documents unless
specifically so stated by Owner in writing.



§ 13.5.2 If the Architect, Owner or public authorities having jurisdiction determine that
portions of the Work require
additional testing, inspection or approval not included under
Section 13.5.1, the Architect
will, upon written
authorization from the Owner, instruct the Contractor to make arrangements for such additional
testing, inspection
or approval by an entity acceptable to the Owner, and the Contractor shall give timely notice
to the Architect and
Owner of when and where tests and inspections are to be made so that the Architect and Owner
may be present for
such procedures. Such costs, except as provided in Section 13.5.3, shall be at the Owner’s
expense.



§ 13.5.3 If such procedures for testing, inspection or approval under Sections 13.5.1 and
13.5.2 reveal failure of the
portions of the Work to comply with requirements established by the Contract Documents, or
reveal faulty or
otherwise defective Work, or if the necessity of any such testing, inspection or approval
procedures arises out of the
fault, neglect or omission of Contractor, the Contractor shall bear all costs of such testing,
inspection, and approval

ARTICLE 14 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE CONTRACT




§ 14.1 TERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTOR



§ 14.1.1 The Contractor may terminate the Contract if the Work is stopped for a period of 30
consecutive days
through no act or fault of the Contractor or a Subcontractor, Sub-subcontractor or their agents
or employees or any
other persons or entities performing portions of the Work under direct or indirect contract with
the Contractor, for
any of the following reasons:





.1

issuance of an order of a court or other public authority having jurisdiction
which requires all Work to
be stopped;


.2

an act of government, such as a declaration of national emergency making
material unavailable or
which requires all Work to be stopped;


.3

because the Architect has not issued a Certificate for Payment and has
not notified the Contractor of
the reason for withholding certification as provided in
Section 9.4.1, or because
the Owner has not
made payment on a Certificate for Payment (without cause) within the time stated

Contractor’s request, reasonable
evidence as required by Section 2.2.1.

Contractor or a Subcontractor,
Sub-subcontractor or their agents or employees or any other persons or entities performing
portions of the Work

interruptions of the entire Work
by the Owner as described in Section 14.3 constitute in the aggregate more than 100 percent of
the total number of
days scheduled for completion, or 120 days in any 365-day period, whichever is less.



§ 14.1.3 If one of the reasons described in Section 14.1.1 or 14.1.2 exists, the Contractor

written notice to the Owner and Architect, terminate the Contract and recover from the Owner
payment for Work
executed and for proven loss with respect to materials, equipment, tools, and construction
equipment and machinery,
including reasonable overhead, profit and damages.



§ 14.1.4 If the Work is stopped for a period of 60 consecutive days through no act or fault of
the Contractor or a
Subcontractor or their agents or employees or any other persons performing portions of the
Work under contract
with the Contractor because the Owner has persistently failed to fulfill the Owner’s
obligations under the Contract
Documents with respect to matters important to the progress of the Work, the Contractor may,

§ 14.2 TERMINATION BY THE OWNER FOR CAUSE



§ 14.2.1 The Owner may terminate the Contract if the Contractor:





.1

persistently or
repeatedlyrRefuses or fails to supply enough property skilled
workers or proper
materials and/or equipment;


.2

fails to make payment to Subcontractors for materials or labor in accordance
with the respective
agreements between the Contractor and the Subcontractors;

.5

is adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or makes a general assignment for the
benefit of Contractor’s
creditors, or a trustee or receiver is appointed for Contractor or for any of its
property, or files a
petition to take advantage of any debtor’s act, or to reorganise under bankruptcy or
similar laws or;


.6

otherwise is guilty of substantial breach of a provision of the Contract
Documents.





§ 14.2.2 When any of the above reasons exist, the Owner, upon certification by the Architect
that sufficient-cause
exists to justify such action, may without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the
Owner and after giving the
Contractor and the Contractor’s surety, if any, seven (7) days’ written notice, terminate

§14.2.3 When the Owner terminates the Contract for one of the reasons stated in Section
14.2.1, the Contractor shall
not be entitled to receive further payment until the Work is finished.



§ 14.2.4 If the unpaid balance of the Contract Sum exceeds costs of finishing the Work,
including compensation for
the Architect’s services and expenses made necessary thereby, and other damages incurred by
the Owner and not
expressly waived, such excess shall be paid to the Contractor. If such costs and damages
exceed the unpaid balance,
the Contractor shall pay the difference to the Owner. The amount to be paid to the
Contractor or Owner, as the case
may be, shall be certified by the Architect, upon application, and this obligation for
payment shall survive
termination of the Contract.




§ 14.3 SUSPENSION BY THE OWNER FOR CONVENIENCE



§ 14.3.1 The Owner may, without cause, order the Contractor in writing to suspend, delay or
interrupt the Work in
whole or in part for such period of time as the Owner may determine.



§ 14.3.2 The Contract Sum and Contract Time shall be adjusted for increases in the cost and
time caused by
suspension, delay or interruption as described in Section 14.3.1. Adjustment of the
Contract Sum shall include
profit. No adjustment shall be made to the extent:

Contract.






§ 14.4 TERMINATION BY THE OWNER FOR CONVENIENCE

cause.

SUBSURFACE EXPLORATION AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PANASONIC WAREHOUSE EXPANSION

SOUTHEAST CORNER OF RANDALL ROAD AND INTERSTATE I-90

ELGIN, ILLINOIS




1.0 PROJECT OVERVIEW




1.1 Project Description




The project consists of the expansion of the existing warehouse located at the southeast corner of
Randall Road and Interstate I-90 in Elgin, Illinois. It is our understanding the project will
consist of expanding the existing warehouse by approximately 337,000 square feet to the south and
east of the existing structure. The proposed warehouse addition will be one story, situated on
shallow foundations with a slab-on-grade. Construction of additional on-grade bituminous concrete
parking lots and the expansion of the east detention pond are also planned. A six-story precast
parking garage, in place of an on grade pavement area, is being considered at the northeast corner
of the proposed warehouse (east of the office building). Proposed finished floor elevations and
columns loads for the proposed parking structure are not known at this time.



The scope of geotechnical exploration of the site consisted of performing 34 soil borings extended
to nominal depths of 5 feet to 42.5 feet. The boring locations were determined and located in the
field by STS Consultants, Ltd. (STS).



The purposes of this report are to describe the site, soil and groundwater conditions, to analyze
and evaluate the data obtained, and to provide recommendations for the design and construction of
the foundations, slab-on-grade areas and pavement for the warehouse expansion. Recommendations
regarding the construction of the detention pond expansion are also included.

2.0 EXPLORATION PROCEDURES




2.1 Subsurface Exploration




Thirty-four (34) soil borings were completed for the geotechnical exploration program. The
soil borings were extended to depths of 5 to 42.5 feet below existing grade. Borings B-1 through
B-9 were extended to 5 to 10 feet below grade and was performed within the proposed parking lots
located at the northwest area of the site. Borings B-10 through B-14 were extended to depths of
30 to 42.5 feet below grade and located within the proposed parking lot/parking garage area at the
northeast corner of the existing warehouse. Borings B-15 through B-19 were performed within the
footprint of the proposed warehouse expansion, on the east side of the structure and extended to a
depth of 20 feet below grade. Borings B-20 through B-24 were extended to a depth of 15 feet
below grade and was located within the warehouse expansion on the south side of the existing
warehouse. Boring 8-25 was extended to 10 and located within the west parking lot expansion.
Borings B-26 through B-32 were extended to depth ranging from 5 to 10 feet below grade and located
within the area of the east parking lot. The remaining borings, B-33 and B-34 were located in the
area of the proposed detention pond expansion and extended to a depth of 15 feet below grade.



The locations and depths of the soil borings were determined, based on discussion with McShane
Construction and located in the field by STS. The locations are shown on the Soil Boring Location
Diagram, Figure 1 in the Appendix. The existing ground surface elevation at each boring location
was surveyed in the field by STS using the existing warehouse floor slab as an assumed benchmark
of 899.5 feet.



The soil borings were performed with a truck-mounted drilling rig using various cutting bits to
advance the boreholes. Samples from the borings were typically obtained at 2.5 foot intervals to
a depth of 15 feet below grade and then at 5-foot intervals to the termination depth of the
borings. Representative soil samples were obtained by means of split barrel and Shelby tube
sampling procedures in general conformance with ASTM Standards D-1586 and D-1587, respectively.
Samples obtained in the field were logged, labeled, sealed and returned to our Vernon Hills,
Illinois laboratory for further examination and testing.

STS Project No. 26363-E

In addition to the above described sampling, in-situ pressuremeter testing was performed in
soil borings B-10 and B-13. Four (4) pressuremeter tests were performed in each boring from depths
of 8.5 feet to 28.5 feet. The purpose of the in-situ pressuremeter testing is to maximum the safe
allowable bearing pressure for the precast parking garage, if constructed.



During the field operations, the drilling crew maintained a log of the subsurface conditions
including changes in the stratigraphy and observed groundwater level. The drilling crew made water
level observations in the boreholes both during and upon completion of the drilling and sampling
operations. These readings are indicated at the lower left hand corner on the boring logs in the
Appendix. Upon completion of the drilling operations, the majority of the boreholes were
backfilled with a mixture of bentonite chips and soil cuttings to prevent groundwater migration
which can occur through boreholes otherwise left open. Soil borings B-10 and B-13 were tremie
grouted upon completion of the drilling operations.



2.2 Laboratory Testing Program




The laboratory testing program consisted of performing visual classification and moisture content
testing on each sample recovered. Hand penetrometer tests were performed on cohesive soil samples
to estimate their unconfined compressive strengths. In the hand penetrometer test, the unconfined
compressive strength of a cohesive soil is estimated, to a maximum of 7.0 tons per square foot
(tsf), by measuring the resistance of the soil sample to penetration by a small spring calibrated
cylinder.



In conjunction with the laboratory testing program, the soil samples were visually examined and
classified on the basis of texture and plasticity in accordance with the STS Soil Classification
System. The estimated group symbol included in parentheses following the soil descriptions on the
boring logs is in general conformance with the Unified Soil Classification System which serves as
the basis for the STS Soil Classification System. A brief explanation of the classification of
soil samples is included in the Laboratory Procedures description page included in the Appendix.

The procedures utilized in preparing the final boring logs from the field logs and laboratory
test data are described in the “STS Field and Laboratory Procedures” attachment. All soil samples
recovered in the borings will be retained on our laboratory for a period of 60 days after which
they will be discarded unless specific instructions as to their disposition are received.



3.0 EXPLORATION RESULTS




3.1 Site Conditions




The site is located at the southeast corner of Interstate I-90 and Randall Road in Elgin,
Illinois. At the time of our subsurface exploration the majority of the site was occupied by the
existing warehouse, 4-story office building and parking lots. The areas where the soil borings
were performed were typically open areas covered with low vegetation. The soil borings on the
south side of the existing warehouse were performed in the existing concrete loading dock area.



Based on the Master Grading and Drainage Plan, C203, dated March 5, 1990 and created by Cowhey
Gudmunson Leder, Ltd. the majority of the site originally ranged in elevation from 877 to 890
feet.



3.2 Soil Conditions




Large variations in soil conditions were encountered at the site. Based on results of the soil
borings completed for this project, the following soil types have been identified. Various
borings encountered clayey topsoil at the ground surface to depths of 3 inches to 2 feet.
Pavement materials were also encountered at the surface of the borings performed in the existing
truck court. Typically cohesive fill soils, such as silty clay fill, were encountered below the
above mentioned materials. Natural silty clay was typically encountered below the fill materials.
Layers of silty organic clay, clayey silt, silt, fine to coarse sand, silty sand and sandy clay
were also noted in numerous soil borings. We refer you to the individual soil borings for the
soil profile encountered in each boring.

McShane Construction Corporation


STS Project No. 26363-E

Topsoil — Dark Brown to black topsoil and clayey topsoil was encountered at the
surface of the majority of the borings performed in the grassy areas. The depth of this layer
ranged across the site from 3 inches to 2 feet. In addition, layers of organic clay were also
encountered at various locations. These soils will be referred to as organic soils throughout
this report. The organic soils typically contained roots, fibers and
sand.



Silty Clay Fill — Silty clay fill was predominately encountered below the pavement and
topsoil layers. The silty clay fill was typically brown and was stiff to hard. The depths of the
fill materials encountered ranged across the site.



Brown to Gray Silty Clay — The majority of the soil borings were terminated in the clay
layer encountered at the site. The silty clay typically encountered in the soil borings was stiff
to hard and ranged from brown to gray in color. This layer contained trace to little amounts of
sand and gravel.



Fine to Medium Sand and Silty Sand — Layers of fine to medium sand and silty sand were
encountered at various depths and thicknesses throughout the soil borings. The sand was typically
loose to medium dense. The soil color ranged from brown to gray and the sand was moist to
saturated, depending on the location of the water table.



Clayey
Silt and Silt — Silt layers ranging from clayey to sandy were encountered at
various depths and various thicknesses in the borings performed at the site. The silt was
typically medium dense and varied in color and moisture.



Numerous variations to the general soil profile were noted. We refer you to the individual boring
logs, attached, for specific information at the boring locations. It should be noted that the
stratification lines indicated on the boring logs were selected on the basis of laboratory tests,
field logs and visual observations of the recovered soil samples. Therefore, the stratification
lines that occur on the boring logs are, in some cases, estimated; in-situ, the transition
between soil types in both the horizontal and vertical directions may be gradual.

STS Project No. 26363-E

3.3 Groundwater Conditions




At the time of field exploration, the majority of the borings performed to a depth of 10 feet or
less were dry both during and after the drilling operations. The majority of the borings extended
below 10 feet encountered groundwater from depths of 7.5 to 15 feet below grade.



We estimate the long-term groundwater level to be between elevations 874 to 879 feet at the time
the borings were performed. Where silt and sand seams are underlain by silty clay, a perched
water table in the cohesionless layers can exist during and after periods of precipitation. The
perched and long-term groundwater levels are subject to change due to seasonal variations,
including precipitation, evaporation and surface run-off.



4.0 GEOTECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS




4.1 Warehouse Expansion




The soil borings performed in the footprint of the proposed warehouse expansion, B-15 through
B-24, encountered a variety of soil conditions. Based on the fill materials encountered in the
soil borings, the existing fill does not appear to have been placed in a controlled manner in the
area east of the existing warehouses. Care should be exercised to avoid undermining the existing
warehouse footings and floor slabs. Confinement of below grade walls should be maintained if
loads are placed on the warehouse slab-on-grade within 10 feet of the existing exterior wall. We
understand the areas on the south side of the building, currently occupied by the loading dock
area will be raised 4 to 5 feet above existing grade to match the existing finished floor.

4.1.1 Mass Grading and Earthwork



Based on the size of the proposed warehouse expansion and the soils encountered east of the
warehouse, it may be more economical to prepare the east warehouse expansion building pad by mass
grading and filling, versus over excavating for foundations and localized over excavation in the
slab-on-grade area where topsoil is encountered. To prepare the warehouse building pad area for
construction of foundations and the slab on grade, all organic soils including clayey topsoil,
organic clay, vegetation and any other objectionable material including uncontrolled clay fill
should be removed and the subgrade observed by a representative of STS Consultants, Ltd.
Unsuitable soils were encountered 2 to 7.5 feet below existing grade.



We understand that the existing concrete for the truck court area (south warehouse expansion) is
planned for removal and recycled to be used as fill. Once the concrete slab is removed, the
underlying aggregate base course should be recompacted to at least 95% of the maximum laboratory
dry density prior to placement of engineered fill.



As an aid in locating unsuitable subgrade soils for slab-on-grade support, the stripped surface
(removal of topsoil) should be proofrolled. In the proofrolling procedure, the stripped surface
consisting primarily of clayey soils is rolled with the heaviest piece of high-tire-pressure
equipment available on the site, such as a heavily loaded tandem axle dump truck having a minimum
gross weight of 25 tons. Where cohesionless soils are encountered, a minimum 10-ton vibratory drum
roller should be used. Clayey silts, sandy silts and silt materials are highly susceptible to
disturbance. We recommend exposed silt materials be avoided during proofrolling and observed
visually by our geotechnical engineer. A minimum of two coverages of the proofrolling vehicle, in
perpendicular directions, is recommended. The proofrolling should be performed under the
observation of a representative of the geotechnical engineer. Soils which exhibit instability or
excessive deflection beneath the proofrolling vehicle should be removed and the proofrolling
continued until all such soils have been located and removed.



Where new fill is required to reach the design foundation and floor slab elevations, we recommend
that an approved inorganic material be utilized as structural fill. This material could consist
of excavated on-site silty clay (natural or fill) or fine to coarse sand, which is free of








7



















McShane Construction Corporation


STS Project No. 26363-E


May 24, 2005








organic matter, topsoil, and debris from the pond excavation or imported, well graded
granular materials, such as IDOT Grade CA-6. We do not recommend reuse of the site silt materials
as structural fill for building pads and pavement areas. The silt materials may be reused for
landscaped areas, if any.



New fill should be placed in maximum 9-inch loose lifts and compacted to a minimum of 95% of the
maximum dry density obtained in accordance with ASTM D 1557, modified Proctor method for building
pad areas. Moisture contents should be maintained within ±3 points of optimum moisture during
placement and compaction.



The completed top of the building pad should extend outward laterally from the proposed perimeter
building footings by a minimum of 10 feet in order to provide for proper compaction below the
foundations and floor slabs, if mass grading is performed.



For local over excavation of the footings and floor slabs, we recommend two feet laterally outside
the perimeter plus one foot for every vertical foot of fill removed be removed and replaced.



4.1.2 Spread Footing Foundations



Based on the subsurface exploration results, we recommend a shallow foundation system be used to
support the proposed warehouse addition. The use of footing type foundations supported on the
natural very stiff to hard silty clay or medium dense clayey silt, silt and sand or
engineered fill placed and compacted to at least 95% of the maximum laboratory dry density is
recommended. Specific allowable bearing capacity recommendations are provided in the following
sections.



To provide adequate frost protection, we recommend that all perimeter footing foundations in
non-heated areas be situated at a minimum depth of 4 feet below final outside grade while the
perimeter footings in heated areas should be situated at a minimum depth of 3.5 feet below final
outside grade. Also, in order to avoid disproportionately small footing sizes, we recommend that
all continuous footings have a minimum width of 1.5 feet and that all isolated column footings
have a minimum lateral dimension of 2.5 feet.

4.1.2.1 Footing Foundations on Natural Soils



For footing foundations situated within the natural, very stiff to hard silty clay layers or
medium dense sands and silts typically encountered below the surficial fill materials, we
recommend a maximum net allowable design soil bearing pressure of 3,000 pounds per square foot
(psf). The net allowable soil bearing pressure refers to that pressure which may be transmitted to
the foundation soils in excess of the final minimum surrounding overburden pressure. A working mat
of 4 inches of lean concrete should be placed where silt is encountered at the base of the
foundation excavation to avoid disturbance of the material.



Total settlement of footing foundations for the warehouse expansion, situated in the recommended
bearing strata described above, is estimated to be approximately
½ to 1 inch with typical
differential settlements on the order of ½ of the total settlement.



4.1.2.2 Footing Foundations on Structural Fill



Foundations may be supported on new properly compacted silty clay or sand fill as described above.
We do not recommend the site clayey silt and silt materials be used as structural fill for
foundations, slab-on-grade or pavement areas. For spread footings foundations supported on
existing or new silty clay or sand fill materials which are free of topsoil or organic material
and properly compacted, we recommend a maximum net allowable soil bearing pressure of 3,000 psf.
The net allowable soil bearing pressure refers to that pressure which may be transmitted to the
foundation soils in excess of the final minimum surrounding overburden pressure. Careful
observation and testing by our geotechnical engineer or field technician of the prepared
foundation soils is strongly recommended during construction.



Total settlement of footing foundations, situated in the recommended bearing strata described
above, is estimated to be less than 1 inch with typical differential settlements on the order of
½ of the total settlement.

4.2 Precast Parking Garage




It is our understanding that a 6-story, precast parking garage is being considered as an
alternative to an on grade parking lot expansion at the northeast corner of the existing
warehouse, directly east of the existing 4-story office building. Soil borings B-10 through B-14
were performed within the proposed footprint of this structure. Unsuitable soils for support of
the proposed building foundations were encountered to typical depths of 7.5 to 10.5 feet below
grade. If the building is to be situated on shallow foundations and a slab-on-grade, we recommend
all existing fill and organic materials be removed below the footings and replaced with structural
fill per the recommendations provided in the Warehouse Expansion section of this report. The
recommendations for the spread footings situated on structural fill are also provided in the
Warehouse Expansion section.



4.2.1 Drilled Caisson Design and Construction



Alternatively, the proposed structure may be situated on drilled caissons. For the Parking Garage,
we recommend drilled straight shaft or belled caissons extended to the natural, low moisture
content stiff to very stiff silty clay encountered at 13.5 to 15 feet below grade. Granular layers
were encountered in borings B-11, B-13 and B-14. A temporary liner will be required through the
granular layers during caisson installation. Based on our geotechnical evaluation and the in-situ
pressuremeter testing, we recommend a maximum net allowable bearing pressure of 10,000 pounds per
square foot (psf) for caissons supported on the above
recommended bearing layer. The maximum net
allowable soil bearing pressure is that pressure which may be transmitted to the foundation soils
in excess of the final minimum surrounding overburden pressure.



The base of the caissons may be belled as required to achieve the required bearing area. Bells
should be formed within day soils to provide stability during belling operations.



Based on estimated loads for the Parking Garage and the consistency of the soils encountered, we
estimate a maximum settlement on the order of 1 inch for caisson foundations supported on the
above mentioned layer. Maximum differential settlements are typically a maximum of ½ of








10

STS Project No. 26363-E

the total settlement for equal loads. It should be noted that these settlement values are for
soil compression only and that elastic compression of the caisson concrete should be added to
these values.



A minimum caisson shaft diameter of 2.5 feet is recommended. Either belled or straight shaft
caissons may be utilized. If belled, the caisson bell should have a base angle of at least 60
degrees (from horizontal) and the bell diameter should not exceed 3 times the shaft diameter.
Caisson concrete may be placed by the free fall method into the clean and dry shaft excavations
as long as concrete does not hit the sides of the shaft or the rebar cage during placement.
Concrete slump should be in the range of 5 to 7 inches.



Depending on the working grade for caisson construction, it may be necessary to temporarily case
through the existing fill and cohesionless materials to depths typically on the order of 10 to 15
feet below grade. The temporary casing should be sealed a minimum 2 feet into the underlying
natural clay to seal off the upper potentially unstable soils. The bells of the caissons should be
extended below this casing.



Because a caisson technician will not be lowered into the excavation to observe the base of the
caisson excavation directly due to safety concerns, we recommend to oversize the bell area by 15%
or 1 foot, whichever is smaller, to provide some excess bearing area so that any excess spoil not
removed by mechanical cleanup can be backbladed beyond the design bearing area. Alternatively, if
it proves more economical, an explosion proof camera could be lowered into the bell after final
cleanup to verify that the bell is suitably free of loose material and the oversize eliminated.



We recommend that the STS geotechnical engineer of record or his/her appointed representative be
present during all phases of caisson construction to observe that the excavations have reached a
suitable bearing stratum as recommended in this report.



The caisson design and construction procedures should be reviewed with the contractor selected
for this work prior to the start of construction. If you wish, we would be pleased to review the
plans and specifications for the foundation work once they are prepared so that we

may have the opportunity to comment on the effects of the soil and groundwater conditions on
the construction.




4.3 Slab-on-Grade and Pavement Subgrade




The subgrade in slab-on-grade and pavement areas should be prepared per the recommendations
provided in the Warehouse Expansion section of this report. Prior to an aggregate base course all
vegetation and other unsuitable materials, such as topsoil materials and other organic deposits,
should be stripped and the subgrade should be observed by a representative of STS Consultants,
Ltd. Proofrolling should be performed after unsuitable soil removal and before filling to locate
near-surface soft or unsuitable soils that may require improvement or removal. The proofrolling
procedures are provided in the Warehouse Expansion section of this report. Proofrolling should be
observed by a representative of the geotechnical engineer.



Where new fill is required to reach the design subgrade elevations, we recommend that an approved
inorganic material be utilized. This material could consist of
excavated on-site silty clay or
sand, which is free of organic matter, topsoil, and debris. Fill material used in pavement
subgrades should be a low frost susceptible material, such as the site silty clay. (Soils that are
primarily silty may be frost-heave susceptible). New fill should be placed in maximum 9-inch loose
lifts and compacted to a minimum of 90% of the maximum dry density obtained in accordance with
ASTM D 1557, modified Proctor method. Where pavement areas are to be utilized by heavy trucks,
such as delivery or refuse pickup, or where the fill exceeds a 5 foot thickness, the fill should
be compacted to a minimum of 95% of the dry density referenced above. For landscaped areas, the
fill should be compacted to a minimum 85% of the dry density referenced above. Moisture contents
should be maintained within ±3 points of optimum moisture during placement and compaction.



Design of rigid pavements and concrete floor slabs-on-grade may be based on an estimated subgrade
modulus value of 100 pci for a natural or properly compacted site silty clay subgrade. An
estimated California Bearing Ratio (C.B.R.) of 3 can be used in design of a flexible pavement
section for a properly prepared silty clay subgrade. Pavement subgrades should be sloped to








12

STS Project No. 26363-E

drain. Where primarily cohesive materials are encountered, we recommend finger drains be
provided at the catch basins, so that water does not accumulate beneath the pavement. Appropriate
drainage outlets should be provided at catch basins for this purpose. Beneath slab-on-grade areas,
a minimum of 6 inches of granular base course material is recommended to facilitate fine grading
and provide a capillary cut-off.



Floor slabs should be isolated from foundations and other penetrations to permit relative
displacement without cracking. Slabs should also be provided with adequate reinforcement and joint
spacing to control slab cracking. If moisture migration through the slab is a concern, a vapor
barrier should be utilized. Care should be exercised when determining proper concrete mix and
procedure in order to avoid slab curling.



4.4 Detention Pond Expansion




It is our understanding the existing detention pond located at the east side of the property will
be expanded to the north. The soils encountered within the pond area are relatively impermeable
silty clays to a depth of 9 to 10 feet below grade. To this depth, the soils should perform
adequately in the side slopes of the basins. Silt and clayey silt was encountered below the silty
clay layer to the termination depth of the borings, 15 feet. Where silt is encountered along the
side slopes or at the bottom of the detention pond, we recommend a minimum 3-foot, compacted clay
layer be used to protect the slopes and the bottom from erosion and uplift. We recommend that 3:1
(H:V) slope or flatter side slopes be used in order to maintain long-term stability of the slopes.
Above the normal water level, the slopes should be vegetated to control erosion.



5.0 CONSTRUCTION CONSIDERATIONS




Based on the results of our exploration, some seepage may develop from the sand and silt layers,
or accumulated precipitation; this water should be handled with typical sump pit and pump
procedures. Excavations performed in the Spring and early Summer may encounter higher groundwater
conditions than excavations performed during drier seasons.








13



















McShane Construction Corporation


STS Project No. 26363-E


May 24, 2005








Accumulations of surface runoff or groundwater should not be allowed to remain within
excavations. Concrete or fill material should not be placed on disturbed soils or in excavations
containing standing water or on subgrade soil that is frozen. A representative of STS should be
present during construction to check that the soil conditions are as anticipated and that the work
is being performed in accordance with the recommendations and the design plans and specifications.



All excavations that extend greater than 5 feet in depth should be made in accordance with OSHA
regulations with properly sloped or braced sides to prevent excavation instability. Excavation
safety is the responsibility of the contractor; however, we recommend that excavation sides be
sloped at 1.5H:1 V or flatter above the water table for this purpose. Some of the excavations
required to remove unsuitable soils from within building footprint areas may be relatively deep.
Stockpiles of material or equipment should not be placed near the top of excavation slopes.

UNDERGROUND ENGINEERING




This report has been prepared in general accordance with normally accepted geotechnical
engineering practices to aid in the evaluation of this site and to assist our Client in the design
of this project. We have prepared this report for the purpose intended by our Client, and reliance
on its contents by anyone other than our Client is done at the sole risk of the user. No other
warranty, either expressed or implied, is made. The scope is limited to the specific project and
location described herein, and our description of the project represents our understanding of the
significant aspects relevant to the geotechnical characteristics. In the event that any changes in
the design or location of the facilities as outlined in this report are planned, we should be
informed so that the changes can be reviewed and the conclusions of this report modified as
necessary in writing by the geotechnical engineer. As a check, we recommend that we be authorized
to review the project plans and specifications to confirm that the recommendations contained in
this report have been interpreted in accordance with our intent. Without this review, we will not
be responsible for the misinterpretation of our data, our analysis, and/or our recommendations,
nor how these are incorporated into the final design.



The analysis and recommendations submitted in this report are based on the data obtained from the
soil borings performed at the locations indicated on the location diagram and from the information
discussed in this report. This report does not reflect any variations which may occur between the
borings. In the performance of subsurface explorations, specific information is obtained at
specific locations at specific times. However, it is a well-known fact that variations in soil and
rock conditions exist on most sites between boring locations and that seasonal and annual
fluctuations in groundwater levels will likely occur. The nature and extent of variations may not
become evident until the course of construction. If variations then appear evident, it will be
necessary for a re-evaluation of the recommendations contained in this report after performing
on-site observations during the construction period and noting the characteristics of the
variations.



The geotechnical engineer of record is the professional engineer who authored the geotechnical
report. It is recommended that all construction operations dealing with earthwork and foundations
be observed by the geotechnical engineer of record or the geotechnical engineer’s appointed
representative to confirm that the design requirements are fulfilled in the actual construction.
For some projects, this may be required by the governing building code.



The scope of services for this project does not include either specifically or by implication any
environmental or biological (e.g., mold, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and the byproducts of such
organisms) assessment of the site, or identification of or prevention of pollutants, hazardous
materials or conditions. Other studies beyond the scope of this project would be required to
evaluate the potential of such contamination or pollution.

Water levels indicated on the boring logs are the levels measured in the boring at the time
indicated. In pervious soils, the indicated elevations are considered reliable groundwater levels.
In impervious soils, the accurate determination of groundwater elevations may not be possible, even
after several days of observations; additional evidence of groundwater
elevations must be sought.




GRADATION DESCRIPTION AND TERMINOLOGY:




Coarse grained or granular soils have more than 50% of their dry weight retained on a #200 sieve;
they are described as boulders, cobbles, gravel or sand. Fine grained soils have less than 50% of
their dry weight retained on a #200 sieve; they are described as clay or clayey silt if they are
cohesive and silt if they are non-cohesive. In addition to gradation, granular soils are defined on
the basis of their relative in-place density and fine grained soils on the basis of their strength
or consistency and their plasticity.

STS Field and Laboratory Procedures







SUBSURFACE EXPLORATION FIELD PROCEDURES




Hand-Auger Drilling (HA)



In this procedure, a sampling device is driven into the soil by repeated blows of a sledge hammer
or a drop hammer. When the sampler is driven to the desired sample depth, the soil sample is
retrieved. The hole is then advanced by manually turning the hand auger until the next sampling
depth increment is reached. The hand auger drilling between sampling intervals also helps to clean
and enlarge the borehole in preparation for obtaining the next sample.




Power Auger Drilling (PA)



In this type of drilling procedure, continuous flight augers are used to advance the boreholes.
They are turned and hydraulically advanced by a truck, trailer or track-mounted unit as site
accessibility dictates. In auger drilling, casing and drilling mud are not required to maintain
open boreholes.




Hollow Stem Anger Drilling (HS)



In this drilling procedure, continuous flight augers having open stems are used to
advance the boreholes. The open stem allows the sampling tool to be used without removing the
augers from the borehole. Hollow stem augers thus provide support to the sides of the borehole
during the sampling operations.




Rotary Drilling (RB)



In employing rotary drilling methods, various cutting bits are used to advance the boreholes. In
this process, surface casing and/or drilling fluids are used to maintain open boreholes.




Diamond Core Drilling (DB)



Diamond core drilling is used to sample cemented formations. In this procedure, a double tube (or
triple tube) core barrel with a diamond bit cuts an annular space around a cylindrical prism of the
material sampled. The sample is retrieved by a catcher just above the bit. Samples recovered by
this procedure are placed in sturdy containers in sequential order.






























STS Standard Boring Log Procedures








STS STANDARD BORING LOG PROCEDURES



In the process of obtaining and testing samples and preparing this report, standard procedures
are followed regarding field logs, laboratory data sheets and samples.



Field logs are prepared during performance of the drilling and sampling operations and are intended
to essentially portray field occurrences, sampling locations and procedures.



Samples obtained in the field are frequently subjected to additional testing and reclassification
in the laboratory by experienced geotechnical engineers, and as such, differences between the field
logs and the final logs may exist. The engineer preparing the report reviews the field logs,
laboratory test data and classifications, and using judgment and experience in interpreting this
data, may make further changes. It is common practice in the geotechnical engineering profession
not to include field logs and laboratory data sheets in engineering reports, because they do not
represent the engineer’s final opinions as to appropriate descriptions for conditions encountered
in the exploration and testing work. Results of laboratory tests are generally shown on the boring
logs or are described in the text of the report, as appropriate.



Samples taken in the field, some of which are later subjected to laboratory tests, are retained in
our laboratory for sixty days and are then discarded unless special disposition is requested by our
client. Samples retained over a long period of time, even in sealed jars, are subject to moisture
loss which changes the apparent strength of cohesive soil, generally increasing the strength from what was originally encountered in the field.
Since they are then no longer representative of the moisture conditions initially encountered,
observers of these samples should recognize this factor.

Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois




1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




Pioneer
Engineering & Environmental Services, Inc. (Pioneer) was engaged by John B. Sanfilippo
& Son, Inc. (Client) to complete a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the subject
property identified as 1701-1715 Randall Road, in Elgin, Illinois. The subject property consists of
an irregular-shaped, approximate 97-acre parcel that is improved with two main structures (subject
buildings) and several additional smaller structures. A four-story office structure (subject
building-A [SB-A]), identified as 1707 Randall Road, encompasses approximately 103,000-square-feet
of the site’s north-central portion, and a two-story
office/warehouse structure (subject building-B
[SB-B]), identified as 1701-1703 Randall Road, encompasses approximately 653,000-square-feet of the
site’s southwestern portion. A fire protection system structure and picnic shelter are located on
the east-central portion of the site; another fire protection system structure is located southwest
of SB-B; a gatehouse is located on the west-central portion of the site; and a barn, identified as
Teeple Barn at 1715 Randall Road, is located on the northwestern portion of the site. See Figure 1
for a Site Diagram.



Investigation indicates that the northwestern portion of the subject property, along Randall Road,
was developed with residential/agricultural structures, including
Teeple Barn, by 1885, Between
1962 and 1972, additional residential structures were constructed on the northwestern and
east-central portions of the site. However, the majority of the subject property was historically
utilized for agricultural purposes. All of the former on-site structures, with the exception of
Teeple Barn, were reportedly demolished in the early 1990s. Subsequently, the subject buildings
and associated structures were constructed on site in the late 1980s, and were completed in
1991/1992. The site has reportedly been utilized exclusively by Matshushita Electric Corporation
of America (MECA) for office, training, electronic repair, diagnostic analysis, and
warehousing/distribution purposes since construction.



Pioneer performed a visual inspection of the site on November 8, 2004. As mentioned, the subject
property is currently occupied by MECA. SB-A is utilized primarily for office purposes; however, a
kitchen/cafeteria is also located on the first floor of this structure. Reportedly, wastes
generated in SB-A consist exclusively of general refuse and waste cooking grease. General refuse
is removed on an as-needed basis by Waste Management and waste cooking grease is removed from the
site on an as-needed basis by Torvac.

Operations conducted in SB-B include electronic equipment repair and diagnostic analysis,
circuit board fabrication, training, warehousing and packaging operations. The type of equipment
repaired and stored on site consists of a variety of electronic products, including television sets
(primarily plasma televisions), cash registers, VCR and DVD players, microwave ovens, massage
chairs, camcorders and robotic equipment. Electronic repair activities primarily consist of
replacing faulty parts, which includes limited soldering activities (to circuit boards) and dusting
the equipment (using compressed air cans). Diagnostic analysis activities include repairing damaged
equipment by identifying faulty parts or programming pre-made electronic equipment (i.e. cash
registers or chip and surging machines). Circuit boards are fabricated in the “Simm Lab” of SB-B by
placing plastic boards into machinery that generates holes and impregnates them with specified
materials contained on reels. Robotic welding machine training activities are also conducted in
SB-B, and electronic equipment packaged in the northwestern portion of SB-B is placed in cardboard
boxes/wooden crates and filled with a packaging foam (“Insta-Pak”).



Waste generated in SB-B includes general refuse, used batteries, electronic component waste (i.e.,
damaged parts/circuit boards), used oil and waste solder. General refuse is removed from SB-B by
Waste Management on an as-needed basis; used batteries are collected and sorted on-site before
being sent to an off-site Panasonic facility for recycling; and electronic waste is removed from
the site by Next Cycle. Reportedly, Safety Kleen is contracted to remove any unused chemicals,
used oil or waste solder generated on site on an as-needed basis; however, no waste oil or solder
was reportedly located on site at the time of the recent inspection,



Pioneer did not observe any unusual staining or odors or the bulk storage of petroleum/hazardous
substances on the subject property during the recent inspection. Additionally, Pioneer did not
observe any obvious evidence of underground storage tank (UST) emplacement on site during the
inspection and the subject property was not identified on the Illinois Register of USTs.



The
subject property, under the facility name MECA, was enrolled into the
Illinois EPA’s (IEPA’s)
Site Remediation Program (SRP) in May 2004, According to the environmental database report (see
Section 5.2), the subject property’s SRP listing currently retains an “open” (unresolved) status
associated with an approximate 500-gallon water/ethylene glycol (utilized as a coolant in the
on-site cooling systems) release that occurred in February 2004 from a cracked pipe attached to a
cooling tower located northwest of SB-B. Pioneer contacted MacTech Engineering & Consulting,

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois




Inc. (MacTec), the environmental firm handling the site’s SRP listing, and Mr. James Whitesel,
MacTec Project Manager, stated that subsequent to the reported release, MacTec collected soil and
groundwater samples in the area of the cooling tower and throughout the subject property. According
to Mr. Whitesel, no evidence of ethylene glycol was identified in the samples collected. MacTec’s
soil and groundwater investigation report was submitted to the IEPA and accepted as the Site
Investigation, Site Objectives and Remediation Objectives Report, Reportedly, a draft “No Further
Remediation” (NFR) letter (signifying formal closure) was issued by the IEPA in October 2004 for
the site’s SRP listing; however, additional information, including tax identification numbers, was
required by the IEPA in order to release the final NFR letter. Subsequently, a final NFR letter
(signifying formal closure) was issued to the site on December 3, 2004.



Pioneer submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the IEPA for additional
information pertaining to the site. According to the IEPA, MECA applied for art Illinois Generator
ID Number in July 1993; 20 hazardous waste manifests were requested from the IEPA at that time.
Additionally, MECA submitted a first Notification of Regulated Waste Activity, dated July 1993 for
the generation of less than 2,200 pounds of toxic wastes (“D008” also identified as lead) on site
per calendar month. Hazardous Waste Reports (HWR), dating from 1993 to 1997, indicated that the
subject property was a periodic generator of hazardous waste. In 1994, approximately 157,900
pounds of hazardous waste were generated on site, identified as damaged consumer electric
products/items with the following waste codes: “D006” (cadmium); “D007” (chromium); “D008” (lead);
and “D009” (mercury). In 1995 and 1996, the site only generated “D009” wastes, from spent
fluorescent ballasts. Reportedly, by 1997, no hazardous wastes were reportedly generated on site.



Additional IEPA documentation included an investigative report, dated May 19, 2004, prepared by
MacTec, indicating that a leak of ethylene glycol/water from a cooling tower located outside SB-B
was discovered. MacTec advanced six soil borings on site; two samples were collected in close
proximity to the release, and the remaining four samples were collected on the northern, eastern
and western portions of the site. Additionally, water samples were collected from all four on-site
ponds. The soil and water samples were analyzed for ethylene glycol; reportedly, none of the
samples exhibited levels of ethylene glycol above the laboratory detection limit (ten parts per
million). Based on the results of this investigation, MacTec recommended completing the IEMA
reporting requirements and seeking a Focused NFR letter from the IEPA.

2.0 STATEMENT OF WORK




Pioneer Engineering & Environmental Services, Inc. (Pioneer) was engaged by John B. Sanfilippo
& Son, Inc. (Client) to complete a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the subject
property identified as 1701-1715 Randall Road, in Elgin, Illinois. The site consists of an
irregular-shaped, approximate 97-acre parcel that is improved with two subject buildings and
several smaller structures. The subject buildings encompass a total of approximately 756,000 square
feet of the site’s surface area. See Figure 1 for a Site Diagram and Appendix A for an Area Map.



A Phase I ESA is designed to identify, to the extent feasible pursuant to the processes described
by ASTM Standard Practice E 1527-00, “recognized environmental conditions” (see definition,
following page) in connection with the subject property. The ASTM standard was developed to provide
current owners, prospective buyers, lending institutions or other interested parties with qualified
professional judgments concerning the presence or likely presence of a petroleum/ hazardous
substance release or substantial threat of a release of a petroleum/hazardous substance. The scope
of this Phase I ESA includes a historical review of the site’s development and prior use, visual
inspection of the site and any associated structures and other improvements, and a review of state
and federal environmental/regulatory databases for the subject site and surrounding properties in
accordance with the requirements of the ASTM standard. Pioneer’s Phase I ESAs are generally
expanded to identify several potential “business environmental risk(s),” including a search for
suspect asbestos-containing materials (ACMs), lead-based paint (LBP), and potential polychlorinated
biphenyl (PCB)-containing light ballasts. Thus, the information contained within this Phase I ESA
has been compiled in such a manner that meets or exceeds the recommended practices established by
ASTM Standard Practice E 1527-00, except whereas specified within this report.



The scope of the Phase I ESA can be further expanded from outlined above as specified by the
Client, or “User.” Unless specifically instructed by the User as to the purpose of the Phase I
ESA, Pioneer is required to assume that it is being prepared for the purpose of qualifying for the
innocent landowner defense to CERCLA liability. The following specific additions or instructions
were made by the User with regard to the purpose and practice of this Phase I ESA: none.

The following terminology and definitions are specific to the ASTM standard:




Recognized Environmental Conditions: “the presence or likely presence of any hazardous
substances or petroleum products on a property under conditions that indicate an existing
release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substances or
petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground, groundwater, or surface
water of the property. The term includes hazardous substances or petroleum products even under
conditions in compliance with laws. The term is not intended to include ‘de minimis’
conditions (see following definition).”




De
Minimis Conditions: “(environmental) conditions that do not generally present a material
risk of harm to health or the environment and that generally would not be subject to
enforcement action if brought to the attention of appropriate governmental agencies.”




Historical
Recognized Environmental Conditions: “(an) environmental condition which in the
past would have been considered a recognized environmental condition, but which may or may
not be considered a recognized environmental condition currently.”




Business Environmental Risk: “a risk which can have a material environmental or
environmentally-driven impact on the business associated with the current or planned use of a
parcel of commercial real estate (such as asbestos, regulatory compliance, lead-based paint
issues, etc.), not necessarily limited to those environmental issues required to be
investigated in this (ASTM) practice.”




Findings: “known or suspect environmental conditions associated with the property, and which
may include recognized environmental conditions, historical recognized environmental
conditions and de minimis conditions, among other environmental conditions.”

3.0 HISTORICAL REVIEW




3.1 Introduction




The historical review process is intended to provide a chronological outline of the prior uses and
development of the subject property in accordance with Section 7.3 of the ASTM standard. The
investigative research attempts to identify potential environmental hazards and their associations
with structures or operations of the past and present. Particular attention was focused on past
owners or operations that may have been involved with the generation, treatment, handling, storage,
or disposal of petroleum/hazardous materials and other practices that may have led to recognized
environmental conditions in connection with the subject property.



Pertinent information was collected from standard historical sources that were reasonably
ascertainable, such as Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, USGS Topographic Maps, aerial photographs,
local building and fire department records, tax assessor records, zoning/land use records and
interviews with persons knowledgeable of the historical use of the site. Primary sources utilized
during this investigation are documented in Section 9.0 of this
report. A detailed account of the
sources contacted during this investigation, including the dates that information was requested and
last updated, is maintained on file at Pioneer and is available upon
request.



It should be noted that Pioneer was unable to obtain site documentation dating back to 1940, in
accordance with ASTM Standard Practice E 1527-00. However, from the documentation available, it
appears that the northwestern portion of the subject property, along Randall Road, was developed
with residential and agricultural (i.e., barn, shed) structures by 1885, and the east-central
portion of the site was developed with a residence by 1972. The remainder of the site was
undeveloped agricultural land prior to the development of the subject buildings in 1992.



3.2 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps




Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps (Sanborn maps) provide detailed drawings of the location and use of
buildings in a given time period as early as the late 1800s. Pioneer reviewed the Sanborn map
collection on file at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Library. However, no maps were
found for the subject property or surrounding area.

3.3 USGS Topographic Maps



Pioneer
reviewed USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Maps (USGS maps) of the area, dated 1962, 1972, 1980,
1992 and 1998 (see Appendix B). The following provides a summary of the pertinent information
gathered from the USGS maps reviewed:





1962:
On the earliest USGS map reviewed, the northwestern portion of the subject property, along
Randall Road, was developed with small, square, rectangular and circular structures that were
similar in appearance to residential and agricultural (i.e., barn, shed) structures; the
circular structure was similar in appearance to the current on-site Teeple Barn. The southern
portion of the site was traversed (in an east to west direction) by a roadway denoted as Lovers
Lane Road, which contained a “Horizontal Control Station” (a permanent mark utilized by the USGS
for future mapping activities) on its eastern portion. The remainder of the site appeared to be
undeveloped vacant land. The areas northwest of the subject property and west of the site were
developed with structures that appeared residential/agricultural in nature. The remaining
adjacent sites were revealed as being undeveloped vacant land. As a note, the Northwest Tollway
(a.k.a. Interstate 90) was developed farther north of the site.




1972 & 1980: The 1972 and 1980 USGS maps revealed no significant changes to the majority of the
subject property. However, additional structures that appeared residential in nature were
developed on the northwestern portion of the site (along Randall
Road) and on the east-central
portion of the site (north of Lovers Lane Road). No significant changes were revealed to the
adjacent sites.




1992: The 1992 USGS map revealed no significant changes to the subject property, with the
exception that Lovers Lane Road had been relabeled as Fox Lane Road and the “Horizontal Control
Station” was labeled “Almora” (note: Almora is the town located directly south of the subject
property). The area southeast of the site was developed with a large, irregular-shaped
structure that was similar in appearance to a current southeast adjacent industrial structure,
and the west adjacent sites were further developed with structures that appeared residential in
nature. No significant changes were revealed to the north or south adjacent sites.






PIONEER ENGINEERING &

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.

Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois





1998: On the 1998 USGS map, all the former on-site structures, with the exception of the
Teeple Barn (denoted as a “Tank”), had been demolished, and Fox Lane Road no longer traversed
the southern portion of the site but was relocated to the south of the subject property. The
north-central portion of the site was developed with an irregular-shaped structure that was
similar in appearance to subject building-A (SB-A); the southwestern portion of the site was
developed with a rectangular structure that was similar in appearance
to subject building-B
(SB-B); and the east-central portion of the site contained two, small square-shaped structures
that were similar in appearance to the current on-site fire protection system structure and
picnic shelter. Further, stormwater detention ponds were denoted on the southeastern and
western portions of the site, and roadways similar to Alft Lane and Ring Road were denoted on
the western portion of the site (to provide access to the site from Randall Road) and around
the subject buildings, respectively. The former northwest adjacent residential structure had
been demolished and the northwest adjacent site was developed with an off-ramp associated with
the northerly-located Northwest Tollway. The east adjacent sites were located within an area
that did not specifically identify individual buildings due to the high structure density in
the region. However, no significant changes were revealed to the south or west adjacent sites.


As
mentioned, Teeple Barn was denoted as a “Tank” on the 1998 USGS map. This is likely due to an
error in updating the USGS maps.




3.4 Aerial Photographs



The following provides a summary of the pertinent information gathered from the aerial photographs
reviewed, which were dated 1980, 1990, 1999, 2001 and 2002 (see Appendix C):





1980: The 1980 aerial photograph revealed that the northwestern portion of the site, along
Randall Road, was developed with several square and rectangular structures, that were similar in
appearance to a farmstead containing a residence and barns/shed, and
a circular-shaped structure
that was similar in appearance to the current on-site Teeple Barn; a structure that appeared
residential in nature was also located south of the farmstead (along Randall Road). A roadway
traversed the southern portion of the site (in an east to west direction), and another structure
that appeared residential in nature was located on the east-central portion of the site,

north of this roadway. The remainder of the subject property appeared to be undeveloped land
utilized for agricultural purposes, with the exception that the northeastern portion of the
site appeared to contain forested land.




The northwest (north of the on-site farmstead) and west adjacent sites were developed with
structures that appeared similar to residential and/or agricultural structures. The remaining
adjacent areas appeared to be undeveloped agricultural land. The area farther north appeared to
be developed with a roadway that was similar in appearance to the current Northwest Tollway.




1990:
The 1990 aerial photograph revealed that the north-central portion of the subject property
was graded and contained a foundation that was similar in appearance to SB-A. A roadway was
constructed along the western and central portions of the southern site border and traversed
through the southeastern portion of the site (in a northeasterly direction); this roadway was
similar in appearance to the current Fox Lane Road. Another roadway traversed north from Fox
Lane Road to the foundation of SB-A on the central portion of the site. Further, a
triangular-shaped body of water was located on the southeastern portion of the site, south of
Fox Lane Road and similar to the current-day improvements. As a note, several areas that were
similar in appearance to bodies of water were visible on the west-central portion of the site.
No significant changes were revealed to the remainder of the site.




The former north adjacent residential structure had been demolished and this area was
redeveloped with an off-ramp from the farther north Northwest Tollway. The east adjacent site
was developed with an irregular-shaped structure that was similar in appearance to the current
southeast adjacent industrial structure. No significant changes were revealed to the remaining
adjacent sites.




1999
to 2002: The remaining aerial photographs revealed that the former on-site farmstead
structures had been demolished, with the exception of the northwesterly-located Teeple Barn.
The north-central and southwestern portions of the site were developed with structures that
were similar in appearance to the current subject buildings and associated asphalt-paved
parking and loading areas. Two smaller structures, similar to the fire protection system
structure and picnic shelter, were developed on the east-central portion of the site, and a
small structure, similar in appearance to the guard house, was visible on its west-central
portion. A roadway, similar to






PIONEER ENGINEERING &

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.
November 15, 2004






















Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois





Ring Road, was visible around the perimeter of the site, and a roadway, similar to Alft Lane,
was visible on the west-central portion of the site (providing access to the subject property
from Randall Road). Further, an additional stormwater detention pond (north of Fox Lane Road)
was visible on the southeastern portion of the site, and two stormwater detention ponds were
observed on the western portion of the site. The remainder of the subject property contained
undeveloped vegetated (grass) cover; however, its northeastern portion appeared to contain
wooded growth.




The remaining aerial photographs revealed no significant changes to the majority of the adjacent
sites; however, the east adjacent site was further developed with an irregular-shaped structure
that was similar in appearance to the current northeast adjacent industrial structure.



3.5 Local Historical Sources



Pioneer submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the City of Elgin Clerk’s Office
in an effort to review information the local code development and fire departments may have on
file for the subject property.



Pioneer reviewed the subject property’s file at the Code Development Department. The records did
not pre-date 1989 and indicated that the subject buildings were identified as 1701-1711 Randall
Road and that Teeple Barn was identified as 1715 Randall Road. Zoning Hearing Minutes, dated 1989,
indicated that the city was holding a hearing prior to altering the zoning of the subject
property. At that time, the site was described as a five-parcel site, consisting of approximately
100 acres, that was developed with three residential structures on three parcels (the remaining
two parcels were identified as being vacant). As a note, all of the structures were to be
demolished, with the exception of Teeple Barn, which was reportedly designated as a historic
landmark.



Numerous building permits (including electrical, plumbing, sewer and water utility, and heating,
ventilation and elevator equipment installation permits), dated 1990 to 1991, were issued to
Matsushita Electric Corporation of America (MECA) for the construction of SB-A, a
102,752-square-foot office building, and SB-B, a 653,184-square-foot warehouse structure. Numerous
office interior and alteration permits, dated 1993 to 2003, were also issued to the subject
buildings.







PIONEER ENGINEERING &

Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois



Information provided for Teeple Barn indicated that the structure was stabilized by
repairing its columns, floor, sills barn bridge and buttress in 1997; structural repairs were
conducted and the cupola was reconstructed in 1999; and the structure was re-roofed in 2003.



The Elgin Fire Department file for the site included the following: numerous inspection records,
dating from August 1992 to September 2003; Commercial Cooking System Service Inspection Reports,
dating from November 1995 to July 2004; and numerous records for fire pump testing activities in
1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002. Additionally, “Tier Two Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory”
sheets documented the presence of ethylene glycol (contained in the closed loop cooling system) on
site in 1996; the presence of ethylene glycol and sulfuric acid (in the batteries used in the
on-site fork-lifts) from 1998 through 2000; and the presence of ethylene glycol, sulfuric acid and
lead (in the batteries used in the on-site fork-lifts) from 2001 to 2003. Material Safety Data
Sheets (MSDS) for ethylene glycol and sulfuric acid were also included in the fire department’s
file for the site.



Additionally,
the fire department’s subject property file included an Illinois Hazardous Materials
Incident Report (H20040217), dated February 2004, that documented the release of an unknown amount
of ethylene glycol from a cooling tower and pipeline containing approximately 3,500- to
5,000-gallons of ethylene glycol in a piping loop. The incident report stated the release was due
to a “small leak” that affected approximately 10 square feet of land. No additional information
was provided; however, the incident report indicated that an environmental firm would be out to
assess the release in order to determine the volume of liquid released. See Section 5.2 for
additional information pertaining to the reported release of ethylene glycol at the subject
property.




3.6 Key Site Manager Interview/Property Owner Questionnaire



The subject property is reportedly owned by MECA. Pioneer interviewed Mr. James Indelak, MECA
Group Manager, and Mr. John Wachowski, MECA Purchasing and Fire and Safety Manager, for
information pertaining to the site. Mr. Indelak and Mr. Wachowski informed Pioneer that the
subject buildings and associated structures were constructed on the subject property in the early
1990s, following the demolition of several residential/agricultural structures. The site has
reportedly been utilized by MECA for office, electronic repair, diagnostic, training, warehousing
and

Elgin, Illinois



distribution purposes since the time of construction, Mr. Indelak and Mr. Wachowski informed
Pioneer that they had no knowledge of the emplacement of underground storage tanks (USTs) on site;
however, Mr. Wachowski stated that two aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) are currently located on
the subject property (see Section 4.8.1). Further, Pioneer was informed that approximately
500-gallons of ethylene glycol (a cooling agent) was released from the air handling equipment north
of SB-B in 2004 and that the subject property was enrolled into the State’s Site Remediation
Program (SRP) in order to obtain closure for the release (see Section 5.2).



It should be noted that a Kane County Chronicle newspaper clipping, dated May 9, 2004, located in
SB-A’s conference room indicated that Teeple Barn was constructed in 1885. The article further
reported that the structure was the only 16-sided barn in Illinois and was historically a portion of
a dairy farm. Reportedly, residents of Elgin were attempting to raise funds in order to repair the
barn.

4.0 SITE INSPECTION




4.1 Introduction



A visual inspection of the subject property consisted of a physical walk-through of the grounds and
buildings to obtain information regarding recognized environmental conditions in connection with
the subject site in accordance with Section 8.0 of the ASTM standard. Particular attention was
focused on, but not limited to, the nature of apparent past and present operations at and adjacent
to the subject site and a specific search for certain petroleum/hazardous substances. The purpose
of the inspection is to assess the potential of a release or imminent threat of a release of a
petroleum/ hazardous substance and/or waste based on the activities performed and observations
noted.



The following sections address the observations noted during the visual inspection conducted on
November 8, 2004. Pioneer personnel was accompanied by Mr. Wachowski during the inspection of the
interiors of the subject buildings, Teeple Barn and east-centrally-located fire protection
structure. It should be noted that observations of the interiors of the structures were limited
due to the presence of ceiling-high shelving units and stored goods. Further, observations of the
exterior of the site were limited due to the presence of numerous parked automobiles and
semi-trucks. As a note, access was not provided to the southwesterly-located fire protection
system structure, the gatehouse or the locked semi-loading dock area located south of SB-B. A
photographic log for the subject property is included in Appendix D of this report.




4.2 Site Location & General Description



The subject property, which is irregular in shape and encompasses approximately 97 acres, is
located at the northeast corner of Randall and Fox Lane Roads, south of the Northwest Tollway
(a.k.a. Interstate 90), in Elgin, Illinois. The site is improved by a four-story office structure
(SB-A) on its north-central portion; a two-story office/warehouse structure (SB-B) on its
southwestern portion; a fire protection system structure and picnic shelter on its east-central
portion; a second fire protection system structure (located southwest of SB-B); a gatehouse on its
west-central portion; and Teeple Barn on its northwestern portion. As a note, a ground-level
covered walkway is located

November 15, 2004






















Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois



on the central portion of the site, providing access from the western portion of SB-A to the
central portion of SB-B. See Figure 1 for a Site Diagram.



The subject property is bisected on its southeastern portion by Fox Lane Road, and Alft Lane is
located on the west-central portion of the site, providing access to the subject property from
Randall Road. Additionally, Ring Road traverses the perimeter of the site. Asphalt-paved parking
areas are located south of SB-A and southwest of SB-B and a cobblestone parking area is located at
the north-central portion of SB-A (this structure’s main entry). A concrete-paved semi-truck
parking area is located southeast of SB-B and a concrete-paved semi-truck loading/parking area is
located south of SB-B.



Two stormwater detention ponds are located on the southeastern portion of the site (one north and
one south of Fox Lane Road) and two stormwater detention ponds are located on the western portion
of the site (one north and one south of Alft Lane). Wooded vegetation, with an associated
mulch-lined walking path, is located on the northeastern portion of the site and the northwestern
portion of the site contains vegetative growth. The area east of SB-B is grass-covered and
contains a soccer field, baseball field and sand-filled volleyball court. Further, the area south
of the fire protection system structure/picnic shelter is improved with two fenced tennis courts.
Decorative landscaping and grass-cover are located throughout the remainder of the site, and a
large, grass-covered mound is located on the northern border of the site, east of the vegetated
area.




43 Surrounding Properties



The subject property is located within a mixed-use area of Elgin. The following provides a summary
of the adjacent properties noted during the recent site inspection.



North: The subject property is bordered to the north by undeveloped grass-covered land
(containing Commonwealth Edison overhead electric transmission lines), followed by a Northwest
Tollway off-ramp (to the northwest). Farther north is the Northwest Tollway.



East: The subject property is bordered to the east by Fox Lane Road (center) and two, one-story
industrial structures occupied by Colony Display (2000 Fox Lane Road) to the north, and Uni-

Elgin, Illinois



Chem (1875 Fox Lane Road) to the south. Farther east are the Northwest Tollway and additional
industrial structures.



South: The subject property is bordered to the south by Fox Lane Road on its western and central
portions and by undeveloped agricultural land on its eastern portion. Farther south is undeveloped
agricultural land.



West: The subject property is bordered to the west by Randall Road, followed by (in a north to
south direction) undeveloped vacant land, Alft Lane and a 7-Eleven/Citgo gasoline station (1570
Randall Road).




4.4 Physical Setting



The topography of the central portion of the subject property is relatively level, with no
significant natural relief features. However, a mounded grass-covered area is located on the
northwestern portion of the site, and stormwater detention ponds are located on the southeastern
portion of the site and along its western border. According to the most recent USGS map available,
the elevation of the subject property is between 870 and 890 feet above mean sea level. Based on
further interpretation of this source, localized groundwater is expected to flow in a southerly
direction, towards Tyler Creek, which is located approximately 1.5 miles from the site (note:
site-specific conditions may vary due to a variety of factors, including geologic anomalies,
utilities, nearby pumping wells [if present] and subsurface structures and/or developments).



Pioneer reviewed Plate 1 of the ISGS Circular, dated 1984 and titled Potential for Contamination of
Shallow Aquifers in Illinois, by Berg, et al., indicating that the regional geologic materials
underlying the subject site are designated as “AX”-type soil. An “AX” soil type classification is
described as containing alluvium, a mixture of gravel, sand, silt and clay, which is located along
streams and is variable in composition and thickness.



Pioneer contacted Cowhey Gudmundson Leder, Ltd. (CGL), the engineering firm contracted by MECA to
assist in the design, development and construction of the on-site structures. According to Mr.
Hubert Loftus, Project Engineer for CGL, no fill materials were brought onto the subject







PIONEER ENGINEERING &

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.
November 15, 2004






















Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois



property during construction activities. However, Mr. Loftus stated that there was an excess of
fill material generated during the development of the subject buildings and associated structures.
This excess fill was reportedly utilized to create the earthen berm (previously referred to as a
grass-covered mound) located along the northern portion of the site
(northeast of the Teeple Barn).




4.5
Site Improvements



SB-A, a four-story office structure, encompasses approximately 103,000-square-feet of the site’s
north-central portion and is constructed of masonry and steel atop a concrete slab foundation.
SB-A’s first floor contains the main entry (north-central portion), a cafeteria/kitchen
(south-central portion) and miscellaneous support offices (i.e., copy center, mail room, computer
rooms), the pump room, maintenance room and a fitness center. The remainder of the first floor and
the second and third floors are improved with office areas. The fourth floor is vacant and does not
contain interior improvements. Six cable-operated elevators are located in SB-A and a belowground
grease trap is located in SB-A’s kitchen. Flooring materials utilized throughout SB-A include
terrazzo, carpeting, vinyl and ceramic tile and concrete; walls consist of drywall, concrete block,
concrete and insulated concrete; and ceilings consist of drywall, drop-panel ceiling tile, concrete
and insulated concrete. Four overhead doors are located along the SB-A’s south exterior wall. An
enclosed outdoor patio is located southwest of SB-A and enclosed air-handling/cooling equipment is
located southeast of SB-A.



SB-B, a two-story office and warehouse/distribution structure, encompasses approximately
653,000-square-feet of the site’s southwestern portion and is constructed of masonry and steel
atop a concrete slab foundation. The northwestern portion of SB-B (first and second floors)
contains general office areas, electronic repair/diagnostic offices and training rooms (note: the
second floor is currently unoccupied); the northeastern portion of the structure contains a small
garage and electric switch room; and the remainder of the structure consists of warehouse areas
(some areas are locked). As a note, a small mezzanine area, utilized to store small
parts/equipment, is located in the southeastern portion of the structure. The warehouse area is
equipped with a conveyor system and two hydraulic elevators are located in SB-B’s office area.
Flooring materials utilized throughout SB-B include terrazzo (main entry at the northwestern
portion), carpeting, vinyl and ceramic tile, epoxy-coated and exposed concrete; walls consist of
drywall, concrete block and concrete; and

ceilings consist of drywall, drop-panel ceiling tile, concrete and a steel deck system in the
warehouse areas.



The east-centrally located fire protection system structure is constructed of concrete block atop a
concrete slab foundation, and the east-centrally located picnic shelter is constructed of concrete,
atop a concrete foundation with a wooden roof and no walls. The
Teeple Barn is constructed of wood
atop a concrete slab foundation, and the covered walkway, which connects SB-A to the SB-B, is
constructed of masonry, glass and steel. None of these structures contain interior improvements.




4.6 Site Utilities



The subject property is reportedly connected to the City of Elgin municipal water and sanitary
sewer systems. Elgin receives potable water from the Fox River Water Reclamation Plant. SB-A is
heated by internal natural-gas fired units (located on each floor); supplemental heat is provided
to the maintenance and kitchen areas by natural gas-fired, ceiling-suspended units. SB-A is cooled
by cooling towers located in a concrete block-walled area southeast of the structure. The office
areas of SB-B are heated by internal natural-gas fired units (located on each floor); supplemental
heat is provided to the garage and warehouse areas by natural gas-fired, ceiling-suspended units.
SB-B is cooled by cooling towers located in a concrete block-walled area northwest of the
structure. As a note, a natural gas-fired, ceiling-suspended unit was observed in the east-central
fire protection system structure. Natural gas is supplied by Nicor, and electrical service is
provided by Commonwealth Edison (ComEd).




4.7 Facility Operations & Wastes



The subject property is currently occupied by MECA primarily for office, electronic repair,
diagnostic analysis, training, warehousing and distribution purposes. Equipment repaired and
stored on site consists of a variety of electronic products, including television sets (primarily
plasma televisions), cash registers, VCR and DVD players, microwave ovens, massage chairs,
camcorders and robotic equipment







PIONEER ENGINEERING &

Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois



SB-A is utilized primarily for office purposes; however, a copy center, a kitchen/cafeteria
and a maintenance room are also located on the first floor of this structure. As a note, Pioneer
was informed that only pre-packaged toner (i.e., no wet inks or solvents) is used in the copy
center, which conducts typical copying operations on a larger scale. Maintenance activities
conducted on site include replacing light bulbs, constructing cubicles and limited touch-up
painting activities. Reportedly, wastes generated in SB-A consist exclusively of general refuse and
waste cooking grease. General refuse, which is disposed into a compactor or numerous dumpsters
observed in the south-central loading dock, is removed on an as-needed basis by Waste Management.
As a note, numerous smaller recycling dumpsters were observed in SB-A’s kitchen area. Waste cooking
grease is removed from the site on an as-needed basis by Torvac, as observed by a waste grease
receptacle located in the south-central loading dock. Further, a below-ground grease trap located
in the kitchen area is reportedly serviced by Torvac four times per year.



Operations conducted in SB-B include electronic equipment repair and diagnostic analysis, circuit
board fabrication, training, warehousing and packaging operations. Electronic repair activities
primarily consist of replacing faulty parts, which includes limited soldering activities (to
circuit boards) and dusting the equipment (using compressed air cans). Diagnostic analysis
activities include repairing damaged equipment by identifying faulty parts or programming pre-made
electronic equipment (i.e. cash registers or chip and surging machines). Circuit boards are
fabricated in the “Simm Lab” of SB-B by placing plastic boards into machinery that generates holes
and impregnates them with specified materials contained on reels. Robotic welding machine training
activities are also conducted on site, and electronic equipment packaged in the northwestern
portion of SB-B is placed in cardboard boxes/wooden crates and filled with a packaging foam
(“Insta-Pak”).



Waste generated in SB-B includes general refuse, used batteries, electronic component waste (i.e.,
damaged parts/circuit boards), used oil and waste solder. General refuse is removed from SB-B by
Waste Management on an as-needed basis, as observed by dumpsters located throughout the structure
and two compactors located along the south exterior wall (note: one compactor was located in the
enclosed, southeasterly-located loading dock). Used batteries are collected and sorted on-site
before being sent to an off-site Panasonic facility for recycling, and electronic waste is removed
from the site by Next Cycle. Reportedly, Safety Kleen is contracted to remove any unused







PIONEER ENGINEERING &

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.
November 15, 2004






















Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois



chemicals, used oil or waste solder generated on site on an as-needed basis; however, no
waste oil or solder was reportedly located on site at the time of the recent inspection.



As a note, MECA utilizes contractors for painting and lawn, elevator and fork-lift maintenance
activities. Pioneer was informed that Otis maintains the on-site elevators and Norvanco manages
SB-B’s warehouse activities. Further, J&D Lift maintains all on-site fork-lifts in a fork-lift
battery charging/repair area located in the southwestern portion of SB-B. A locked maintenance area
and triple trap oil/water separator system were observed in this area; however, Pioneer was
informed that this equipment is maintained by employees of J&D Lift. Further, the contractors
reportedly bring all supplies on-site and remove all wastes generated from their maintenance
activities.



Pioneer was informed that no wastewater discharge permits are associated with the subject property
as on-site operations do not involve any process wastewater. Further, Pioneer was informed that
the subject property formerly maintained an air permit associated with emissions generated during
the cleaning of computer key boards with air; however, these operations reportedly ceased and the
air permit was not renewed. It should be noted that a formal compliance audit was not included
within the scope of this assessment.




4.8 Underground Storage Tanks



Underground storage tanks (USTs) that exist or previously existed at sites may represent a
potential environmental risk due to the possibility of tank system failures and/or spills and
overfills. An inspection was conducted at the subject property in order to identify the location
of any USTs that exist or may have existed. Specific attention was focused on visual indications
of equipment associated with USTs, such as fill or vent piping, dispensers, dispenser islands, or
evidence of excavations. Information for the UST investigation was gathered from the visual
inspection, personal interviews, the local municipal agencies, and the Illinois Register of USTs.





4.8.1 Subject Property Underground Storage Tanks




No obvious evidence of the emplacement of USTs was observed on the subject property and the
site was not identified on the Illinois Register of USTs. Additionally, there was no
information






PIONEER ENGINEERING &

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.
November 15, 2004






















Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois





pertaining to UST emplacement at the subject property in the Elgin Code Development or Fire
Department’s files for the site.




4.8.2 Adjacent Property Underground Storage Tanks




None of the adjacent sites were identified on the Illinois Register of USTs. However, Pioneer
observed a currently-operating Citgo/7-Eleven gasoline station on the west adjacent site, across
Randall Road. Visual observations, including vent pipes, fill ports and dispenser islands,
indicated the presence of two USTs on this site, directly east of the on-site convenient store
structure. It should be noted that this site, which is located approximately 100 feet from the
subject property, is not currently identified as having a reported release (i.e., leaking UST
[LUST] incident).




No obvious evidence of the emplacement of USTs was observed on the remaining adjacent sites.



4.9 Other Petroleum/Hazardous Substance Storage



No bulk storage of petroleum/hazardous substances was note on site; however, Pioneer observed an
approximate 200-gallon diesel fuel AST in the east-centrally-located fire protection system
structure during the recent inspection. Reportedly, diesel fuel is utilized to run the fire
protection equipment in case of a fire; this equipment is tested once a week. Additionally, a
back-up generator is located at the southeastern portion of SB-A (in the enclosed cooling tower
area). A 270-gallon diesel fuel AST is located in the base of this equipment, which has only been
utilized once since installation in the early 1990s; this equipment is tested semi-annually. No
significant staining or other signs of leakage were observed in the area of the ASTs at the time of
the inspection. It should be noted the second fire protection system structure reportedly does not
contain any ASTs as its fire protection equipment is powered by electricity.



Pioneer also observed 55-gallon drums of Insta-Pak and a cleaner/degrcaser; and several
small-volume containers (one-pint to five-gallon) of the following materials in the subject
buildings: miscellaneous cleaning supplies; hydrochloric and nitric acid; acetone; paints; water
treatment







PIONEER ENGINEERING &

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.
November 15, 2004






















Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois



chemicals (i.e., oxidizers); gasoline; spray paint; black top sealer; carpet adhesive;
primer; and hydraulic oil. The majority of these substances were
observed in flammables cabinets,
or in the individual workstations in the electronic repair areas. No significant staining or other
signs of product leakage were observed around the containers at the time of the recent site
inspection. As a note, Pioneer also observed 55-gallon “spill kits” and an overpack drum in SB-A’s
kitchen area; these containers are reportedly stored on site in case of a spill.




4.10 Asbestos-Containing Materials



This section addresses a potential environmental concern beyond the scope of ASTM Standard
Practice E 1527-00. Restrictions for asbestos use in building materials became more stringent in
the 1970s, and the use of friable and sprayed-on asbestos was prohibited in 1978 by the
Environmental Protection Agency with the passage of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous
Air Pollutants (NESHAP). Friable and sprayed-on asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) are easily
crumbled or pulverized and therefore easily made airborne. Friable ACMs are a potential health
hazard. Non-friable ACMs are not a major concern unless they become airborne by such processes as
sanding, drilling, milling, cutting, etc. during renovation or demolition.



A comprehensive asbestos survey is beyond the scope of this Phase I ESA. The asbestos survey
conducted at the subject property was limited to an inspection of readily-accessible interior
areas and was not intended to be suitable for pre-renovation or demolition purposes. Particular
attention was focused on identifying asbestos-containing insulation, plaster materials, floor
tiles, and sprayed or troweled-on structural coverings. Sampling and analysis were not included as
part of this investigation.



Pioneer
identified drywall (and associated tape/joint compound), 12" x
12" vinyl floor tile (and
associated mastic), and 2' x 4' drop ceiling tile, which are generally considered suspect ACMs, in
the office areas of the subject buildings; additionally, spray-on insulation was observed on the
fourth floor and in the kitchen area of SB-A. Based on the date of construction of the subject
buildings (early 1990s), Pioneer believes it is unlikely that these materials contain asbestos.
However, a review of original building supply lists, manufacturer’s documentation, and/or
analytical testing would be necessary to confirm this contention.

4.11 Lead-Based Paint



The use of lead-based paint (LBP) was widespread in the construction industry prior to 1973, due
to its durability. At that time, amendments to the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act
established the allowable level of lead in paint to 0.5 percent by weight of dry sample. This
limit was implemented to eliminate the hazard of LBP in housing. LBPs can exist on any painted
surface. Such paint, if properly maintained and in good condition, poses little risk. However,
damaged or deteriorated surfaces can present a health threat, especially to children under six
years of age. Chipping or peeling paint poses a threat if ingested; however, the greatest danger
lies in the inhalation of dust particles. Lead dust particles, frequently associated with
deteriorating LBP, can be brought to the surface by moisture or can be released by friction or by
frequent impact on surfaces such as windows and door frames.



A comprehensive survey is beyond the scope of this Phase I ESA. The LBP survey conducted at the
subject property was necessarily limited to a visual inspection of readily accessible areas.
Particular attention was focused on identifying deteriorated areas of painted surfaces and frequent
impact surfaces such as window and door frames. Bulk sampling and analysis of suspect LBPs were not
included within the scope of this survey.



Painted surfaces were observed to be in good condition throughout the interior of the subject
buildings. Based upon the construction dates of the structures (early 1990s), the painted surfaces
are not considered to contain to LBP.




4.12 Potychlorinated Biphenylic Compounds



The use of Polychlorinated Biphenylic (PCB) compounds was widespread in various manufacturing and
industrial applications due to their superior dielectric, lubricating and fire-retardant
properties prior to their federal ban in 1979. Pioneer’s focus has been limited to the more common
potential PCB sources, which include dielectric fluids used in electrical equipment such as
transformers and capacitors, unless otherwise stated.







PIONEER ENGINEERING &

Numerous step-down transformers were observed throughout the subject buildings during the recent
inspection. Based on their installation date Pioneer does not believe that this equipment
represents a significant environmental concern to the subject property at this time.



Several pad-mounted electrical transformers were observed on the subject property during the
recent inspection. The transformers appeared to be in sound condition, and no signs of leakage or
staining were noted. According to information previously received from ComEd, which owns and
maintains this equipment, all ComEd transformers in the northern Illinois area were replaced or
tested by 1988 and should now be considered “non-PCB.” Therefore, Pioneer does not believe that
this equipment represents a significant environmental concern to the subject property.



The ballasts associated with fluorescent light fixtures are also possible sources of PCBs
depending on their specific manufacturer and the date of manufacture. Equipment containing PCBs
that is old, neglected, or damaged may leak and is therefore potentially hazardous depending on
the actual PCB content and the specific PCB isomer involved. As a result, Pioneer includes a
discussion of this equipment although this specific potential source of PCBs is beyond the scope
of the ASTM standard.



Fluorescent light ballasts were observed throughout the subject buildings and in the
east-centrally-located fire protection system structure. However, ballasts located in these
structures were not considered as potential sources of PCBs, based upon their apparent age. No
additional suspect PCB-containing equipment was observed during the site inspection.

5.0 ENVIRONMENTAL DATABASE REVIEW




5.1
Introduction



The purpose of this section is to identify sites within a prescribed distance from the subject
property that are listed on standard environmental databases that may have a potential impact on
the subject property in accordance with Section 7.2 of the ASTM Standard. The following is a list
of federal and state databases searched for the area surrounding the subject property; the search
distances are noted in parenthesis.





•

NPL:	 	The National Priorities List (NPL) is a federal list of abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous
waste sites identified for priority remedial action under the Superfund program (1.0 mile).


•

CERCLIS:
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information
System (CERCLIS) is a compilation of the sites that the EPA has
investigated or is currently investigating, pursuant to the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), for a
release or threatened release of a hazardous substance. It also includes
abandoned or uncontrolled waste sites identified under the federal
Superfund program (0.5 mile). Sites which have been investigated and
subsequently delisted from CERCLIS are designated as No Further Remedial
Action Planned (NFRAP) sites (subject and adjacent properties).


•

RCRIS:
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Information System (RCRIS) is a listing of
facilities that are regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA). RCRIS lists facilities that treat, store or dispose (TSD) of
hazardous waste (0.5 mile) and identifies hazardous waste handlers with
corrective action (CORRACTS) activity (1.0 mile). RCRIS also lists
small-quantity generators (SQGs) and large-quantity generators (LQGs) of
hazardous waste (subject and adjacent properties).


•

ERNS:
The Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) records and stores information on
reported releases of oil and hazardous substances (subject property only).


•

UST:
The Underground Storage Tank (UST) database lists USTs registered with the Office of the
State Fire Marshal (subject property and adjacent properties).


•

LUST:
The Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) records contain an inventory of LUST
incidents reported to the state (0.5 mile).


•

SRP:
The Illinois Site Remediation Program (SRP) database includes properties that are enrolled in
the state’s voluntary clean-up program (0.5 mile).


•

SCL:
The State Category List (SCL), which is no longer active, was compiled by the Illinois EPA
(IEPA) and includes sites identified for investigation or remediation. The
SCL is the state equivalent to the NPL or CERCLIS (1.0 mile).


•

SWF/LF:
The Solid Waste Facilities/Landfills (SWF/LF) records typically contain an inventory of solid
waste disposal facilities or landfills, active or inactive, in a particular state (0.5 mile).


•

HISWD:
The Historical Inventory of Solid Waste Disposal (HISWD) database is a one-time issued list,
compiled by the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission (NIPC), which
identifies historical waste sites in Northern Illinois (0,5 mile).

It should be noted that a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request would be required to
obtain more information concerning the compliance status of any of the sites identified during the
environmental database review. This request may take four to six weeks to obtain. As a matter of
standard practice, Pioneer would require client authorization prior to initiation of the process.
Any pertinent information subsequently received would then be forwarded to the client and
amendments, if warranted, to any recommendations made in this report would be evaluated at that
time.




5.2
Federal & State Notifiers/Listings



FirstSearch Technology Corporation (FirstSearch) provided regulatory information for the site and
surrounding properties in a radius map report. Properties/listings identified in the Environmental
FirstSearch™ Report within the ASTM minimum search distances from the subject property include one
SRP listing. Specific information regarding this listing can be found in the complete FirstSearch
report, which is included as Appendix E to this report.



The subject property was identified as an “active” SRP site on the environmental database report.
According to the FirstSearch report, the subject property was enrolled into the SRP in May 2004
and the listing currently retains an “open” (unresolved) status; however, the current on-line IEPA
database reported the SRP listing was “closed” and a “No Further Remediation” (NFR) letter
(signifying formal closure) was issued to the site on December 3, 2004. Mr. Indelak and Mr.
Wachowski stated that the site’s SRP listing is associated with an approximate 500-gallon water/ethylene glycol (utilized as a coolant in the on-site cooling systems) release that occurred from
a cracked pipe attached to a cooling tower located northwest of SB-B in February 2004. Pioneer
contacted MacTech Engineering & Consulting, Inc. (MacTec), the environmental firm handling the
site’s SRP listing. According to Mr. James Whitesel, MacTec Project Manager, subsequent to the
reported release, MacTec collected soil and groundwater samples in the area of the release and
throughout the subject property. According to Mr. Whitesel, no evidence of ethylene glycol was
identified in the samples collected. Further, Mr. Whitesel stated that ethylene glycol degrades
very rapidly and it was unlikely that elevated levels of ethylene glycol would be identified in
the samples analyzed. MacTec’s soil and groundwater investigation report was submitted to the IEPA
and accepted as the Site Investigation, Site Objectives and Remediation Objectives Report.
Reportedly, a draft NFR letter was issued by the IEPA in October 2004 for the site’s SRP listing;
however,





PIONEER ENGINEERING &

ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.
November 15, 2004






















Phase I Environmental Site Assessment

1701-1715 Randall Road

Elgin, Illinois



additional information, including tax identification numbers, was required by the IEPA in
order to release the final NFR letter.



Pioneer reviewed the Focused NFR letter, dated December 3, 2004, issued for the subject property’s
SRP listing. Reportedly, the letter was issued for the specified release of ethylene glycol at the
subject property, which is restricted to commercial/industrial land use. Further, the letter states
that the disturbance or removal of contamination that has been left in place must be done in
accordance with the Remedial Action Plan (RAP); access to soil contamination may be allowed if,
during and after any access, public heath and the environment are protected consistent with the
RAP.



Pioneer also submitted a FOIA request to the IEPA for additional information pertaining to
the subject property. According to the IEPA, MECA applied for an Illinois Generator ID Number in
July 1993; 20 hazardous waste manifests were requested from the IEPA at that time. Additionally,
MECA submitted a first Notification of Regulated Waste Activity, dated July 1993 for the generation
of less than 2,200 pounds of toxic wastes (“D008” also identified as lead) per calendar month.



A 1993 IEPA Hazardous Waste Report (HWR), dated May 1994, indicated that the subject property did
not generate hazardous waste in 1993. A 1994 HWR, dated February 1995, stated that in 1994,
approximately 157,900 pounds of hazardous waste were generated on site, which was identified as
damaged consumer electric products/items that contained the following waste codes: “D006”
(cadmium); “D007” (chromium); “D008” (lead); and
“D009” (mercury). A 1995 HWR, dated February 1996,
and a 1996 HWR, dated February 1997, indicated the site was only a periodic generator at this time
and that only “D009” wastes, from spent fluorescent ballasts, were generated on site during 1995
and 1996. A 1997 HWR, dated February 1998, indicated that no hazardous wastes were generated on
site in 1997.



Additional IEPA documentation included an investigative report, dated May 19, 2004 and prepared by
MacTec Engineering and Consulting (MacTec). MacTec reported that HVAC contractor personnel
discovered a leak of ethylene glycol/water from a cooling tower located outside SB-B. MECA
reportedly called an incident in to IEMA, and incident number 20040217 was issued to the site,
MacTec subsequently advanced six soil borings on site; two samples were collected in close

proximity to the release, and the remaining four samples were collected on the northern,
eastern and western portions of the site. Additionally, water samples were collected from all four
on-site ponds. The soil and water samples were analyzed for ethylene glycol; reportedly, none of
the samples exhibited levels of ethylene glycol above the laboratory detection limit (ten parts
per million). Based on the results of this investigation, MacTec recommended completing the IEMA
reporting requirements and seeking a Focused NFR letter from the IEPA.



Subsequently, MECA submitted a Site Remediation Program Application and Services Agreement Form,
dated May 20, 2005, to the IEPA. This form documented MECA’s request to be enrolled into the SRP
and requested a Focused NFR letter for the release of ethylene glycol documented at the site. A
letter, dated May 24, 2004, issued to MECA by the IEPA indicated
that the site’s enrollment into the
SRP was complete and the Mr. Todd Gross would be assigned as the lEPA’s Project Manager for the
site.

6.0 FINDINGS & OPINIONS



Based on the information gathered during this Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, within the
scope of this investigation and pursuant to the requirements of ASTM Standard Practice E 1527-00,
the following findings and opinions are presented below:




1. Recognized Environmental Conditions:





•	 	None





2. Historical Recognized Environmental Conditions:





•	 	None





3. De Minimis Conditions:





•	 	According to the IEPA, the subject property is identified as a “closed” SRP
site associated with an approximate 500-gallon water/ethylene glycol release that occurred
from a cracked pipe attached to a cooling tower located northwest of SB-B in February
2004. Apparently, the subject property was enrolled into the SRP in May 2004 and
according to a representative of MacTec, soil and groundwater samples were collected in
the area of the release and throughout the site and no evidence of ethylene glycol was
identified in the samples collected. Reportedly, a draft NFR letter for the site’s SRP
listing was issued by the IEPA in October 2004 and the final Focused NFR letter was
issued by the IEPA on December 3, 2004. Based on the available information, Pioneer
believes the site’s SRP listing represents a de minimis condition to the subject property
at this time. However, Pioneer recommends that the final Focused NFR letter be
properly recorded.

•	 	Pioneer observed a currently-operating Citgo/7-Eleven gasoline station on the west
adjacent site, across Randall Road. Two USTs are currently located on this site, which
is apparently not identified on the Illinois Register of USTs. However, based on its
distance (~100 feet), the available information and/or the inferred southerly direction
of

8.0 CLOSING REMARKS



Pioneer warrants that the findings and conclusions contained herein have been promulgated in
accordance with ASTM Standard Practice E 1527-00, Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process,
only for the site described in this report. No environmental assessment can eliminate the
uncertainty regarding the potential for recognized environmental conditions in connection with a
property. The Phase I ESA is designed to reduce, but not eliminate, uncertainty regarding the
potential for recognized environmental conditions in connection with
a property.



Due to the limited nature of the work, there is a possibility that conditions may exist which
could not be identified within the scope of the assessment, or which were not apparent at the time
of the report preparation. The scope of the Phase I ESA does not include the sampling or
analytical testing of substances encountered at the subject site. Consequently, a subsurface
investigation would be necessary in order to analytically determine the environmental condition of
the subject site.



Pioneer is not responsible for independently verifying the information provided. Further, Pioneer
cannot be held responsible if the user, current owner or key site manager does not communicate to
Pioneer any specialized knowledge or experience that is material to recognized environmental
conditions in connection directly or indirectly with the subject property.



This report has been prepared for the sole use of the Client identified in the report and can not
be relied upon by other persons or entities without the joint permission of the Client and
Pioneer. The observations and conclusions contained herein are limited by the scope and intent of
the work mutually agreed upon by the Client and Pioneer and the work actually performed. Pioneer
believes the findings and conclusions provided in this report are reasonable. However, no
warranties are implied or expressed.



Pioneer appreciates the opportunity to be of service to you on this project. We hope this
information meets your needs at this time. If you have any questions regarding this initial
assessment, please contact us at (773) 722-9200.

Notice of Disclaimer






Due to the limitations, constraints, inaccuracies and incompleteness of government
information and computer mapping data currently available to FirstSearch Technology Corp.,
certain conventions have been utilized in preparing the locations of
all federal, state and
local agency sites residing in FirstSearch Technology Corp.’s databases. All EPA NPL and state
landfill sites are depicted by a rectangle approximating their location and size. The
boundaries of the rectangles represent the eastern and western most longitudes; the northern
and southern most latitudes. As such, the mapped areas may exceed the actual areas and do not
represent the actual boundaries of these properties. All other sites are depicted by a point
representing their approximate address location and make no attempt to represent the actual
areas of the associated property. Actual boundaries and locations of individual properties can
be found in the files residing at the agency responsible for such information.





Waiver of Liability





Although
FirstSearch Technology Corp. uses its best efforts to research the actual
location of each site, FirstSearch Technology Corp. does not and can not warrant the
accuracy of these sites with regard to exact location and size. All authorized users of
FirstSearch Technology Corp.’s services proceeding are signifying an understanding of
FirstSearch Technology Corp.’s searching and mapping conventions, and agree to waive any and
all liability claims associated with search and map results showing incomplete and or
inaccurate site locations.

CERCLIS-NFRAP (Archive) : Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability
Information System Archived Sites. The Archive designation means that, to the best of EPA’s
knowledge, assessment at a site has been completed and that EPA has determined no further steps
will be taken to list this site on the National Priorities List (NPL). This decision does not
necessarily mean that there is no hazard associated with a given site; it only means that, based
upon available information, the location is not judged to be a potential NPL site.

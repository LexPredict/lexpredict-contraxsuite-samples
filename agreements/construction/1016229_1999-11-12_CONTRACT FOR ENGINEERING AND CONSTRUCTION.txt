Contract, including those referred to in Article 24 (Owner's Responsibilities),
where such Owner failure inhibits, delays, or otherwise adversely affects
Contractor's ability to perform the Work in accordance with the Initial City
Schedule and/or Acceptance Date; provided, however, that no delay shall be an
Excusable Delay unless such delay could not have been either (x) avoided by
Contractor, its Subcontractors or their respective Affiliates through the

failure to meet its responsibilities under this Contract, including those
detailed in Article 23 (Owner's Responsibilities), in which event there shall be
an equitable adjustment to the Contract Sum, the pricing for such adjustment to
be determined in accordance with Article 11.3 (Pricing of Changes) or (ii) the

(de jure or de facto) or a change in the regulatory regime at the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission, or state or local jurisdictions that results in
treating the Terrestrial Repeater Network System materially different from PCS,
cellular or other local wireless distribution systems, the effect of which is to
create a materially more cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive process per
Site, in which event there shall be an equitable adjustment to the Contract Sum
to address the changed circumstances the Parties did not foresee, the pricing
for such adjustment to be determined in accordance with Article 11.3 (Pricing of
Changes).

(b) In the event the U.S. Federal Communications Commission preempts state
and local jurisdiction over permits, approvals and licenses and the result of
such preemption is to create a materially less cumbersome, time-consuming and
expensive process per Site, there shall be an equitable decrease in the Contract
Sum to take into account the effect of such improved efficiencies.

(c) On or before the tenth (10th) Business Day after the end of each
calendar month in which Contractor asserts an event constituting an Excusable
Delay, Contractor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Owner
a claim for contract adjustments for Excusable Delay, detailing the delays over
the prior calendar month for which Contractor claims a contract adjustment
pursuant to this Article 7.5 (Contract Adjustments). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, failure to make such a claim in writing to Owner within
sixty (60) Calendar Days after the occurrence of an Excusable Delay shall
constitute a waiver of such claim. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Article
7.5 (Contract Adjustments) shall be set forth in an Amendment to this Contract
in accordance with Article 28.3 (Amendments).

7.6  NO CLAIMS FOR WEATHER CONDITIONS OTHER THAN EXTRAORDINARY WEATHER
CONDITIONS.

claim for an increase in the Acceptance Date as a result of rain, snow, cold, or
other weather conditions (not including those referred to in Article 7.4(a)
(ii)), unless such conditions are Extraordinary Weather Conditions.

7.7 NO CLAIMS FOR PREVENTION OF EARLY COMPLETION.

Contractor waives the right to assert any claim against Owner in the event
Contractor is unable to complete a Key Task before the date set forth in the
applicable Initial City Schedule, regardless of the reason for Contractor's
failure, including the acts or omissions of Owner; provided, however, in the
event of an Excusable Delay caused directly by Owner's failure to meet its
responsibilities under this Contract, including those detailed in Article 24
(Owner's Responsibilities), Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable
adjustment pursuant to Article 7.5 (Contract Adjustments) and further provided
that in the event of a suspension of Work in accordance with Article 5.9

or rejection of the City Network within fourteen (14) Calendar Days after
receipt of Contractor's certification required by Section 5 of Exhibit E
(Network Testing and Acceptance Criteria). Owner shall accept a City Network in
the event that the Repeater Acceptance Test Report establishes that the City
Network meets the Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria as set forth in Exhibit E
(Network Testing and Acceptance Criteria). In the event Owner provides
Contractor notice of acceptance, the accepted Work shall be deemed accepted as
of the date of Contractor's certification ("Acceptance"). In the event Owner
rejects the Work or any part thereof, Owner shall provide Contractor with a
Notice of Defects. Where Owner fails to provide Contractor written acceptance or
Notice of Defects within the said fourteen (14) Calendar-Day Period, the
certified Work shall be deemed accepted as of the date of Contractor's
certification. If Contractor disputes the contents of a Notice of Defects,
Contractor shall notify Owner in writing of the basis for its dispute within
fourteen (14) Calendar Days of receipt of Owner's Notice of Defects. In the
event Contractor does not dispute such Notice of Defects, the Parties shall
proceed in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 below:

(1)  In the event the Repeater Acceptance Testing indicates Contractor
did not implement the Build-To City Network Design, in any
material way, as set forth in such Design (irrespective of the
reason for such failure), then Contractor, at its cost, shall
perform all additional RF Engineering and other services (except
Site Construction at additional Sites if any are required)
required to implement such Design and, at Owner's cost in
accordance with the pricing set forth in Exhibit C (Contract
Pricing, Payments and Milestone Achievement Criteria), Contractor
shall perform all Site Construction and provide all equipment
(except repeaters, which shall be provided by Owner at Owner's
expense) at any additional Sites as required to implement the
Build-To City Network Design.

(2)  In the event Contractor has implemented the Build-To City Network
Design in accordance with such Design, but the Repeater
Acceptance Testing nevertheless indicates the City Network does
not meet the



26

<PAGE>   34
CONFIDENTIAL

Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria set forth in Exhibit E (Network
Testing and Acceptance Criteria), the Parties shall analyze the
cause of the discrepancies between the Build-To City Network
Design and the Repeater Acceptance Testing results. If the
discrepancy is due to Contractor's failure to design the City
Network in accordance with the performance standards set forth in
Article 10.1(a) and/or to implement the Build-To City Network
Design in accordance with the performance standards set forth in
Article 10.1(a), then Contractor, at its cost, shall perform all
additional RF Engineering and other services required (except
Site Construction at additional Sites) for the City Network to
meet the Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria, and, at Owner's cost
in accordance with the pricing set forth in Exhibit C (Contract
Pricing, Payments and Milestone Achievement Criteria), Contractor
shall perform Site Construction and provide all equipment (except
repeaters which shall be provided by Owner at Owner's expense)
required for the City Network to meet the Repeater Acceptance
Test Criteria.

(3)  If the discrepancy is due to any other cause, then Contractor, at
Owner's cost in accordance with the pricing set forth in Exhibit
C (Contract Pricing, Payments and Milestone Achievement
Criteria), shall perform the RF Engineering and other services
and provide the equipment necessary for the City Network to meet
the Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria.

(4)  Upon completion of the work set forth in paragraphs (1), (2) and
(3) above, Contractor shall repeat Repeater Acceptance Testing in
accordance with this Article 8.1 and Exhibit E, to the extent
necessary to demonstrate compliance with the Repeater Acceptance
Test Criteria.

(d) Owner shall determine, in its reasonable discretion, the time at which
the work required by paragraphs (b)(1) - (b)(4) above shall be performed
promptly or otherwise. The schedule and cost impact of postponing correction of
such deficiencies for a material period of time after completion of Repeater
Acceptance Testing shall be mutually agreed by the Parties; it is the Parties'
expectation that correction of such deficiencies promptly after completion of
Repeater Acceptance Testing shall impact neither the pricing set forth in
Exhibit C (Contract Pricing, Payments and Milestone Achievement Criteria) nor
Contractor's performance to schedule.

(e) Owner shall provide Contractor with written notice within thirty (30)
Calendar Days after receipt of the Repeater Acceptance Test Report required by
Exhibit E (Network Testing and Acceptance Criteria), identifying that portion of
the work required by paragraphs (b)(1) - (b)(4) above that Owner desires
Contractor to commence promptly, as well as, that portion of the Work Owner does
not desire Contractor to commence promptly. For portions of the Work that Owner
does not request Contractor to commence promptly, such portions of the work
shall be deemed completed and fully functioning for purposes of Contractor's
reperformance of Repeater Acceptance Testing and meeting the Repeater Acceptance
Test Criteria under paragraph (b)(4) above.

8.2 CITY NETWORK TESTING OF REPEATERS AND ONE SATELLITE

Upon Owner's request, Contractor shall test each City Network with the
first of Owner's satellites against live test criteria (the "Live Testing").
Such Live Testing shall not be within the scope of this Contract and shall be
the subject of later agreement by the Parties. Such later agreement shall
include the following:

(a) The Live Test Criteria shall be developed for the integrated repeater
and one -satellite, for at least the same level of performance established in
the Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria (appropriately adjusted to reflect
improved City Network performance reasonably expected as a result of adding
additional sites pursuant to Article 8.1 (Repeater Acceptance Testing) and
satellite coverage). The Live Testing shall be conducted in accordance with a
Live Test Plan proposed by Contractor for Owner's review and approval prior to
the first scheduled Live Testing. Contractor shall incorporate Owner's
reasonable comments into the Live Test Plan prior to commencing Live Testing.

(b) Contractor shall deliver to Owner a report setting forth in detail the
results of Live Testing, including all test data. If the results of the Live
Testing indicate the City Network fails to meet the Live Test Criteria, and if
such deficiency is the result of Contractor's failure to design in accordance
with the applicable standards set forth in Article 10.1(a), then Contractor, at
its cost, shall perform all additional RF Engineering and, at the Parties'
shared costs, Contractor shall perform all other services (except Site
Construction ) required to meet the Live Test Criteria, and, at Owner's cost in
accordance with the pricing set forth in the Exhibit C (Contract Pricing,
Payments and Milestone Achievement Criteria), Contractor shall perform all Site
Construction and provide all equipment and antennas required to meet the Live
Test Criteria (repeaters to be provided by Owner at Owner's expense).

(c) It is understood by the Parties that Contractor will apply best
engineering practices within the limitations of Contractor's satellite line of
sight tool and data input (imperfect USGS maps and absence of building,
vegetation and other morphological data).

by Contractor for delivery to Owner, Contractor represents and
warrants it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make
such warranties assignable to Owner or to make Owner the intended
third-party beneficiary thereof.

(2)  With respect to warranties that are assignable, Contractor shall
assign all such warranties to Owner on demand and in no event
later than Acceptance of the City Network in which the relevant
materials, equipment and services are incorporated or to which
they are related, whichever occurs earlier. With respect to
warranties that are not assignable or for which Owner is the
intended third-party beneficiary, Contractor shall enforce such
warranty on behalf of Owner prior to the first anniversary of the
Acceptance of the City Network to which the warranted material,
equipment or services attaches; thereafter, upon Owner's request,
Contractor shall provide such enforcement on a Task-Order Pricing

(f) Code.

Contractor represents and warrants: (i) it shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure no viruses or similar items are coded or introduced
into the Work; (ii) it shall not introduce into the Work any code that would
have the effect of disabling or otherwise shutting down all or any portion of
the Work; and (iii) it shall not develop, or seek to gain access to the Work
through any special programming devices or methods, including trapdoors or
backdoors, to bypass any Owner security measures protecting the Work.

(g) Year 2000 Compliance.

Contractor represents and warrants that it has (i) undertaken an assessment
of all significant computer hardware, software, networks, systems and equipment
used by Contractor directly to perform the Work ("Business Systems") that could
be adversely affected by failure to accurately adapt, accommodate, process or
respond to the date 9/9/99, periods spanning the twentieth and twenty-first
centuries, and dates within the Year 2000 and thereafter ("Year 2000 Ready"),
(ii) developed a plan and a timeline for rendering all Business Systems material
to the Work to be Year 2000 Ready (the "Year 2000 Plan") before any failure
would have a material adverse effect on the Work, and (iii) to date, implemented
such plan in accordance with such timetable in all material respects. Contractor
represents and warrants that (i) it has and will continue to request all
Material Subcontractors to provide to Contractor assessments of the Year 2000
Readiness of all material computer hardware, software, networks, systems and
equipment of such suppliers used in providing products or services to Contractor
businesses ("Supplier Systems"), (ii) it has received such assessments from all
Material Subcontractors and (iii) based on such assessments to date and after
reasonable inquiry, nothing has come to its attention to cause it to believe
that all material Supplier Systems will not be Year 2000 Ready in all material
respects. The Year 2000 Plan and each such Material Subcontractor's response,
have been previously provided to Owner. Contractor's sole obligation under the
foregoing warranty shall be to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
correct any non-conformity therewith.

(h) Compliance with Applicable Law.

Contractor represents and warrants the Work will conform to all applicable
Federal, State, and municipal Laws, including safety, health and environmental
Laws.

(i) Replacement Parts.

applicable to such replacement part supplied under warranty shall begin anew
from the date said replacement part is installed and is ready to begin service;
with respect to all other replacement parts, Contractor shall provide such parts
on industry-standard terms.

10.2 DUTY TO CORRECT.

(a) Contractor shall cure any breach of warranty after receipt of Notice of
Defect thereof from Owner, provided that payment has been made in respect
thereof, and regardless of prior reviews, inspections, approvals or acceptances
and regardless of whether Contractor disputes Owner's assertion of a breach of
warranty.

(b) Contractor shall fulfill the foregoing obligations at its own expense,
including, with respect to Site Construction, all costs arising from charges for
de-installation, removal, installation, repair, packaging, shipping, insurance,
taxes and other matters associated with the corrective measure.

(c) If Contractor fails to cure any breach of warranty after two (2)
attempts at correction, such attempts not to exceed thirty (30) Calendar Days,
after receipt of a Notice of Defect from Owner, Owner may, by separate contract
or otherwise, make the necessary cure and Contractor shall pay to Owner the
reasonable costs of such cure.

(d) If, after corrective measures have been taken, Contractor continues to
dispute Owner's assertion of a breach of warranty, Owner and Contractor shall
enter into dispute resolution pursuant to Article 22 (Dispute Resolution). If it
is determined by written agreement of the Parties or pursuant to Article 22
(Dispute Resolution) that a breach of warranty did not exist, Owner shall be
liable to Contractor for the incremental costs incurred by Contractor as a
result of any cure measures performed by Contractor, such costs to be reimbursed
in accordance with the Default Pricing for Contractor services set forth in
Exhibit C (Contract Pricing, Payments and Milestone Achievement Criteria).

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, if correction of any breach of warranty
causes a delay in the Acceptance of any City Network, the provisions of Article
7.2 (Liquidated Damages) shall apply.

10.3 DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY.

11. CHANGES IN SCOPE OF WORK

11.1 CHANGES REQUESTED BY OWNER.

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) below, Owner shall be entitled
to direct, during the performance of this Contract, any change within the
general scope of this Contract, including any change that will add, delete, or
change the Work, affect the design or construction of any Site or the time for
performance of the Work set forth in the Initial City Schedules and/or
Acceptance Date; provided, however, (i) this Article 11 (Changes in Scope of
Work) shall not be used by Owner to terminate this Contract in part for
convenience; (ii) Owner shall be entitled only to direct additions or changes to
the Work for which Contractor has, or will have within a reasonable period of
time using commercially reasonable efforts, the resources to perform such
addition or change; (iii) the additions or changes to the Work involve services
Contractor provides as part of its ordinary business; and (iv) the additions or
changes to the Work will not materially adversely affect Contractor's
performance under the Initial City Schedules.

(b) Any change directed by Owner as described in paragraph (a) above shall
be submitted in writing to Contractor. Contractor shall respond to such directed
change in writing to Owner within fourteen (14) Calendar Days after receipt of
such directed change and shall include in such response the details of the
impact of such change in the Work on the Contract Sum and/or Initial City
Schedules and/or Acceptance Date. In the event Contractor, using commercially
reasonable efforts, cannot prepare such details within such period, Contractor
shall so advise Owner and shall submit, for Owner's approval, a request for an
extension of such period that in no event shall exceed sixteen (16) Calendar
Days, such request to set forth the reasons that the details of the impact of
such change could not be documented within such fourteen (14) Calendar Days
using commercially reasonable efforts. Upon Owner's approval, Contractor shall
be granted such extension.

(c) If Owner and Contractor agree upon the change in the Contract Sum
and/or the Initial City Schedule and/or Acceptance Date caused by the change in
the Work, Contractor shall proceed with the performance of this Contract as
changed immediately upon the execution by both Parties of a Change Order
reflecting such agreement.

(d) If the Parties cannot agree on a change to the Contract Sum and/or
Initial City Schedule and/or Acceptance Date, as occasioned by the additions or
changes in the Work directed by Owner pursuant to paragraph (a) above, Owner may
issue a Change Directive for such additions or changes. Contractor shall proceed
with the Work in accordance with the Change Directive and Owner may dispute the
reasonableness of Contractor's determination with respect to the appropriate
change to the Contract Sum and/or Initial City Schedule and/or Acceptance Date
under Article 22 (Dispute Resolution). Pending resolution of such dispute, Owner
shall pay Contractor in accordance with Article 11.3(b). If it is determined by
written agreement of the Parties or pursuant to Article 22 (Dispute Resolution)
that Contractor is entitled to an amount other than the amount paid by Owner,
Owner shall pay to Contractor the amounts of the shortfall or Contractor shall
refund to Owner the amount of the excess, as the case may be, with interest on
such amount running from the date of initial payment by Owner to the date of



35

CONFIDENTIAL

additional payment or refund, as the case may be, at the interest rate set forth
in Article 28.11 (Calculation of Interest).

(e) Any determination of a change to the Contract Sum pursuant to this
Article 11.1 (Changes Requested by Owner) shall be made in accordance with
Article 11.3 (Pricing of Changes).

11.2 CHANGES REQUESTED BY CONTRACTOR.

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below, Contractor may request, during
the performance of this Contract, any change within the general scope of this
Contract, including any change that will add or delete Work, cause a revision to
the Initial City Schedules or Acceptance Date or affect any other requirement of
this Contract.

(b) Any changes as described in paragraph (a) above requested by Contractor
shall be submitted in writing to Owner at least thirty (30) Calendar Days prior
to the proposed date of the change, or such notice as is reasonable under the
circumstances, that is, the notice for a complex and costly change shall be
significantly greater than that for a simple change that does not impact the
Contract Sum. If such Contractor-requested change causes an increase or decrease
or other impact on the Work, Contract Sum, Initial City Schedules or Acceptance
Date or other terms of this Contract, Contractor shall submit, with such
request, a written proposal identifying such change and the impact thereof on
the Contract Sum, Initial City Schedules or Acceptance Date or other terms of
this Contract.

(c) Owner may accept or reject such request in Owner's sole discretion.
Owner shall notify Contractor in writing, within fourteen (14) Calendar Days
after receipt of the requested change proposal, or within such period as is
reasonable under the circumstances; that is, the response to a notice that would
require significant analysis due to adverse changes in Contract Sum, Initial
City Schedules or Acceptance Date may be longer than that for a minor change
that does not adversely impact Contract Sum, Initial City Schedules or
Acceptance Date, whether or not Owner agrees with and accepts such change and
the impact thereof. If Owner agrees with and accepts Contractor's requested
change and such impact thereof, Contractor shall proceed with the performance of
this Contract upon the execution by both Parties of a written Change Order
reflecting such changes. If Owner does not agree to the requested change,
Contractor shall continue performance in accordance with this Contract without
regard to such requested change.

(d) Any determination of a change to the Contract Sum pursuant to this
Article 11.2 (Changes Requested by Contractor) shall be made in accordance with
Article 11.3 (Pricing of Changes).

11.3 PRICING OF CHANGES.

(a) When calculating the change in the Contract Sum caused by changes in
the Work pursuant to this Article 11 (Changes in Scope of Work), the pricing set
forth in Exhibit C (Contract Pricing, Payments and Milestone Achievement
Criteria) shall apply to increases,



36

<PAGE>   44
CONFIDENTIAL

decreases and other changes in the Work, as applicable. Where the pricing in
Exhibit C does not apply to a specific change, (i) if the change in the Work
alters the Work in a manner that results in the provision of additional services
or materials, the increase in the Contract Sum shall be equal to either (a) a
lump sum agreed to by the Parties, or (b) in the absence of agreement by the
Parties, the Default Pricing set forth in Exhibit C (Contract Pricing, Payments
and Milestone Achievement Criteria) for Contractor services, and (ii) if the
change in the Work alters the Work in a manner that results in the provision of
fewer services or materials, the decrease in the Contract Sum shall be equal to
either (a) a lump sum agreed to by the Parties or (b) in the event the Parties
cannot agree on such lump sum, a percentage reduction, as reasonably agreed by
the Parties, in the Milestone Payments to which the Work relates in an amount
reflecting the reduction of services or materials necessary to complete the
Milestones. In determining any increase or decrease in the Contract Sum under
this Article 11.3 (Pricing of Changes), the increase or decrease to the Contract
Sum shall be further adjusted to take into account the effect, if any, of the
increase, decrease or other change in the Work on the efficiencies in
performance by Contractor (and its Subcontractors), including the effect on
changes in the Initial City Schedules, the incurrence of wind-down expenses
(including those described in Article 26.1(d)) and the incurrence of
mobilization expenses.

(b) In the event the Parties cannot agree on a change to the Contract Sum
as contemplated by Article 11.1(d), then pending resolution of such dispute,
Owner shall pay Contractor in accordance with the specific prices set forth in
Exhibit C (Contract Pricing, Payments and Milestone Achievement Criteria) or, if
such specific pricing is not applicable, in accordance with the Default Pricing
for Contractor services set forth in Exhibit C.

(c) Any adjustment made pursuant to this Article 11 (Changes in Scope of
Work) shall be set forth in an Amendment to this Contract in accordance with
Article 28.3 (Amendments).

(c) Without limiting the generality of Article 12.2(a), in its performance
of this Contract, Contractor will not, directly or indirectly, make, offer, or
agree to make or offer any loan, gift, donation, or other payment, whether in
cash or in kind, for the benefit, or at the direction, of any candidate,
committee, political party, government or its subdivision, or any individual
elected, appointed, or otherwise designated as an employee or officer thereof,
for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such entity or individual
or inducing such entity or individual to do or omit to do anything, in order to
obtain or retain business or other benefits.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Article 12.2(a), Owner shall be
responsible for obtaining all permits, licenses and approvals required by the
Federal Communications Commission for the Terrestrial Repeater Network System to
receive or transmit radio frequency signals in the United States. In the event
Owner is unable to obtain any or all of the necessary FCC permits, licenses or
approvals, or is unable to obtain such permits, licenses or approvals in the
time period desired by Owner, Owner shall have the right, as it in its sole
discretion determines, to require Contractor to (i) suspend all or part of the
Work in accordance with Article 7.3 (Suspension of Work By Owner), and/or (ii)
slow the pace or otherwise modify the schedule for performance of the Work in

(e) Contractor, if requested by Owner, shall review with Owner any
application Contractor makes to any governmental or quasi-governmental
department, agency, or entity for any approval, permit, license, or agreement,
as may be required for the performance of the Work, prior to submission of such
application. Contractor shall provide Owner a minimum of three (3) Business Days
to review such application prior to submission to such governmental or
quasi-governmental entity, and Contractor shall in good faith consider any
comments and proposed revisions made by Owner for incorporation into such
application. Owner shall reasonably cooperate with Contractor in Contractor's
efforts to procure all such approvals, permits, licenses, and agreements.

(f) Neither Party shall be responsible in any way for the consequences,
direct or indirect, of any violation of any law by the other Party, the other
Party's Subcontractors or the respective Affiliates or Associates of such other
Party.

Nothing in this Contract shall be construed as creating any contractual
relationship between Owner and any Subcontractor. Contractor is fully
responsible to Owner for the acts or omissions of Subcontractors and all persons
used by Contractor or a Subcontractor in connection with performance of the

Owner of the proposed assignment, shall introduce the individual to appropriate
Owner representatives and, upon request, provide such representatives with the
opportunity to interview (either in person or by phone) the individual and shall
provide Owner with the individual's resume. If Owner in good faith objects to
the qualifications of the proposed individual within ten (10) Business Days
after being afforded the opportunity to interview the proposed individual,
Contractor shall discuss such objections with Owner and resolve such concerns on
a mutually agreeable basis or, if unable to do so, select another candidate in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 14.3 (Assignment if Key
Personnel). Failure on the part of Owner to express its objections within ten
(10) Business Days of such notice shall be deemed acceptance of the assignment
of such individual. The Key Personnel that have been approved as of EDC are
listed in Attachment A (Key Personnel) hereto. Should the individuals filling
the positions of Key Personnel leave such positions for whatever reason,
Contractor shall follow the procedures set forth in this Article 14.3

17. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article 17, all Developed
Materials provided by Contractor under this Contract, together with all
Intellectual Property Rights in and to such Developed Materials, shall be deemed
to be works made for hire as defined in 17 U.S.C. Section 101 of the United
States Copyright Act of 1976, as amended. Owner shall be deemed the author of
such Developed Materials and shall own all right, title and interest in and too
all Intellectual Property Rights in the Developed Materials, with the right to
use, adapt and change said Developed Materials and to prepare derivative works
therefrom. To the extent any Developed Materials are deemed to not be works made
for hire, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) below, this
Contract shall constitute an irrevocable, fully paid-up, perpetual, worldwide
assignment by Contractor to Owner of Contractor's rights in the ownership of,
and all Intellectual Property Rights in, such Developed Materials, and Owner
shall have the right to obtain and hold in its own name all Copyright Rights and
similar protections that may be available in such works. Contractor agrees to
give Owner or its designee, at Owner's expense, all assistance reasonably
required to perfect such rights. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)
below, in the event Contractor utilizes Subcontractors in performing Work for
Owner, Contractor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for Owner,
ownership of, and all Intellectual Property Rights in, the Developed Materials
developed or produced by any Subcontractor.

(b) The Parties acknowledge that various Subcontractors preparing site
specific drawings may not normally convey full ownership of their work (e.g.,
architectural & engineering drawings, environmental reports, title reports and
title surveys, land surveys, etc.) (collectively "Site Specific Drawings") in
the normal course of business. With respect to these items, Contractor shall
convey to Owner all rights that are provided by the Subcontractor in connection
with its products or services, including Site Specific Drawings. At a minimum,
however, Contractor shall convey to Owner a fully paid-up, perpetual,
non-terminable royalty-free license to use all Site Specific Drawings prepared
by Subcontractors for the Project. Contractor will not retain or obtain in the
future any Intellectual Property Rights with respect to the Site Specific
Drawings developed under this Contract. Subject to Article 20.3 (Indemnification
Procedures), Owner agrees to indemnify Contractor and the A&E Subcontractors
from any Losses arising out of use of any Site-Specific Drawings beyond the
scope of their intended purpose.

(c) Contractor will own all Intellectual Property Rights in and to any
software developed, refined or modified by Contractor in the course of, or to
aid in any way its performance under, this Contract ("Contract Software"), and
in all Contractor Tools, regardless of whether Owner has paid for such
development, refinement or modification, and except with respect to the license
set forth in this paragraph (c) regarding WINDS, Owner shall have no rights to
use such Contract Software or Contractor Tools. In the event Owner wishes to use
such Contract Software (other than WINDS) or Contractor Tools, Owner and
Contractor shall in good faith negotiate a license therefor. Owner understands
and agrees that any such Contract Software or Contractor Tools will be provided
"as is" with no warranty of any kind, and Contractor shall have no obligation to
support or maintain such software or tools. With respect to WINDS, and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Contract and Attachment C (Terms and
Conditions of License), Contractor hereby grants to Owner a fully paid up,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable restricted



47

<PAGE>   55
CONFIDENTIAL

right and license to use the WINDS software at Owner's facility solely for
Owner's internal business purposes (i) until the first City Network to achieve
Acceptance, to access Project data accessible through the WINDS software using
an internet browser and (ii) upon occurrence of the first City Network to
achieve Acceptance, to use a single copy of the WINDS software for all purposes
for which it was intended, including to access, add, delete and edit Project
data and other data associated with the Terrestrial Repeater Network System on
such single copy, as such system may evolve over time.

(d) Owner shall own all Patent Rights arising out of or relating to any
invention developed under this Contract that relate to technology incorporated
into infrastructure equipment that is not the core business of Contractor but is
essential to the business of Owner ("Owner Patent Rights"). Contractor will own
all other Patent Rights arising out of or relating to this Contract. Owner
hereby grants to Contractor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, assignable
license to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, or import technology,
apparatus, methods or services that are covered by such Owner Patent Rights with
the right to sublicense any of the foregoing rights. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, (i) it shall be a violation of the foregoing license to
exercise any of the foregoing rights (including assignment and sublicensing) for
the benefit of any direct competitor of Owner, and (ii) in the event of any such
violation, Owner may revoke the license granted to Contractor herein. Owner
agrees it will not license, transfer or assign Owner Patent Rights to a direct
competitor of Contractor.

(1)  Contractor shall promptly notify owner, in writing, of any
and all inventions subject to Owner Patent Rights.

(2)  Owner has the primary option for taking all action with
respect to filing and obtaining patents and other suitable
forms of protection in the United States and in any foreign
country in which Owner desires to perfect such right, at
Owner's sole expense from and after EDC. If Owner does not
exercise the above option within six (6) months of the first
public use of the subject matter to be patented, then
Contractor has the right to file and obtain patents and
other suitable forms of protection in the United States or
any foreign country at its sole expense. Further, if either
Party has exercised its right with respect to Owner Patent
Rights, then the other Party shall cooperate fully with the
Party that exercised such rights, such cooperation to
include the preparation, filing and prosecution of all
patent applications filed pursuant to this paragraph, and
which shall include execution by the other Party and its
employees of any and all such papers and instruments as are
necessary or helpful to the preparation, filing and
prosecution of all such patent applications. Regardless of
which Party files for a patent application or other suitable
form of protection pursuant to this paragraph, Owner shall
own the patent application and patent or other protection.

(3)  If any Owner Patent Right is infringed by a third party, the
Party first having knowledge of such infringement shall
promptly notify the other in writing, which notice shall set
forth the facts of such infringement in reasonable detail.
Owner shall have the primary right, but not the



48

<PAGE>   56
CONFIDENTIAL

obligation, to institute, prosecute, and control any action
or proceeding with respect to such infringement, through
counsel of its own choice, and Contractor shall have the
right, at its own expense, to be represented in such action
by counsel of its own choice. If Owner fails to bring such
action or proceeding within a period of one hundred twenty
(120) Calendar Days after receiving written notice from
Contractor or otherwise having knowledge of such
infringement, Contractor shall have the right to bring and
control any such action by counsel of its own choice, and
Owner shall have the right, at its own expense, to be
represented in any such action or proceeding. In any event,
the second Party agrees to be joined as a party plaintiff
and to give the first Party reasonable assistance and
authority to file and prosecute such suit. The Party
bringing such suit shall be responsible for all expenses of
prosecuting such suit (except to the extent the other Party
elects to be represented by counsel of its own choosing). In
the event of any damages or other monetary awards covered
therein in favor of Owner and/or Contractor, the Party
bringing suit will be entitled to recover its expenses first
and any remaining portion of such award shall then be paid
fifty percent (50%) to Owner and fifty percent (50%) to
Contractor. No settlement or consent judgment or other
voluntary final disposition of a suit under this Article may
be entered into without the joint consent of Owner and
Contractor (which consent shall not be withheld
unreasonably).

(4)  Each Party agrees to pay to the other Party, commencing in
the first full fiscal quarter after EDC, and continuing
quarterly thereafter, a royalty of fifty percent (50%) of
all net revenues, if any, derived from the manufacture, use
or sale of products covered by the subject of the patent or,
from the licensing or sublicensing of the Owner Patent or
patent license as the case may be. Such royalties shall be
paid on or before the last day of the first month following
the applicable fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, Contractor shall not be obligated to
pay royalties with respect to any services it provides in
the ordinary course of its business, even if such services
are provided using products covered by the subject of the
Owner Patent.

(5)  Each Party agrees to keep full, true, and accurate books of
account containing all particulars that may be necessary for
the purpose of showing the amount of royalties payable to
the other pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of Article 17
(Intellectual Property Rights). Each Party shall keep these
books of account at the usual place where its books are
kept. Each Party shall retain such books and the supporting
data for at least three (3) years following the end of the
fiscal year to which they pertain, and shall make available
the supporting data for inspection by the other Party or an
independent certified public accountant retained by such
other Party for the purpose of substantiating the amount of
the first Party's royalty payments, or, in the case of
Contractor, compliance with the patent license granted
herein. The inspecting Party shall pay for the services of



49

<PAGE>   57
CONFIDENTIAL

the independent certified public accountant unless the
independent certified public accountant determines that the
other Party has understated the royalties due the inspecting
Party, in which case the other Party shall pay the entire
amount charged by the accountant for the accountant's
services. The non-inspecting Party agrees to pay the balance
of such royalties plus interest within ten (10) Calendar
Days after written notice of the understatement, such
interest computed in accordance with Article 28.11
(Calculation of Interest) from the day on which said
royalties were due and owing until the date paid.

(e) Except as provided in this Article 17, Owner may use all Developed
Materials provided by Contractor hereunder to complete the Project, for
additions to the Project, or for any other purpose. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Contractor will have no responsibility or liability to
Owner with respect to any modification to the Developed Materials made by Owner
or any other contractor retained by Owner.

third-party U.S., Canadian or Mexican Intellectual Property Right.

(b) If the use of the Work or any part thereof is enjoined, Contractor
shall, or, if in Contractor's reasonable opinion the Work or any part thereof is

case may be, or substitute an equivalent product reasonably acceptable to Owner,
or modify the Work or infringing part thereof to render them non-infringing

(or by others, other than Contractor or its Subcontractors, acting on behalf of
Owner); or (ii) any modification by Owner (or any entity, other than Contractor
or its Subcontractors, acting on behalf of Owner), of the Work or any part
thereof not intended or reasonably foreseeable by Contractor; or (iii) any

settle the claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate, at the reasonable
cost and expense of the indemnifying Party. Provided that the indemnified Party
acts in good faith, it may settle such claim on any terms it reasonably
considers appropriate under the circumstances without in any way affecting its
right to be indemnified hereunder. The indemnifying Party shall promptly
reimburse the indemnified Party for all such costs and expenses.

20.4 WAIVER OF SUBROGATION.

If a Party insures against any loss or damage it may suffer in respect of
which it is required to indemnify the other Party, its Affiliates and their
respective Associates pursuant to this Article 20 (Indemnification), it shall be
a condition that the insuring Party arrange for the insurer to waive its right
of subrogation against such other Party and such other Party's Affiliates and
their respective Associates. Each Party shall be entitled to require proof from
time to time that the other Party has complied with its obligations under this
Article 20.4 (Waiver of Subrogation). In the event a Party does not comply with
such obligations, the indemnities referred to in Articles 20.1 (Contractor's
Indemnification) and 20.2 (Owner's Indemnification) shall extend to any claim
that may be made by an insurer pursuant to an alleged right of subrogation.

22. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any dispute, claim, or controversy between the Parties arising out of or
relating to this Contract ("Dispute"), including any Dispute with respect to the
interpretation, performance, termination, or breach of this Contract or any
provision thereof shall be resolved as provided in this Article 22 (Dispute
Resolution).

22.1 INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

Prior to the initiation of formal dispute resolution procedures, the
Parties shall first attempt to resolve their Dispute informally, in a timely and
cost-effective manner, as follows:

(a) If, during the course of the Work, a Party believes it has a Dispute
with the other Party, the disputing Party shall give written notice thereof,
which notice will describe the Dispute and may recommend corrective action to be
taken by the other Party. Contractor's Project Manager shall promptly consult
with Owner's Project Manager in an effort to reach an agreement to resolve the
Dispute.

(b) In the event agreement cannot be reached within five (5) Calendar Days
of receipt of written notice, either Party may request the Dispute be escalated,
and the respective positions of the Parties shall be forwarded to an executive
level higher than that under paragraph (a) above for resolution of the Dispute.

(c) In the event agreement cannot be reached under paragraphs (a) or (b)
above within a total of ten (10) Calendar Days after receipt of the written
notice described in paragraph (a) above, either Party may request the Dispute be
escalated, and the respective positions of the Parties shall be forwarded to the
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of each Party, and such executives shall meet
during such time to resolve the Dispute.

(d) In the event agreement cannot be reached under paragraphs (a), (b) or
(c) above within a total of twenty (20) Calendar Days after receipt of the
written notice described in paragraph (a) above, either Party may proceed with
arbitration in accordance with Article 22.2 (Arbitration).

22.2 ARBITRATION.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Article 22.1(Informal Dispute Resolution)
and Article 22.3 (Litigation), any Dispute shall be resolved by mandatory and
binding arbitration in accordance with the then-effective Center for Public
Resources Rules for Nonadministered Arbitration of Business Disputes, as may be
amended from time to time (the "CPR Rules"), which are incorporated herein by
reference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any provision of this
Article 22.2 (Arbitration) modifies, adds to, or is inconsistent with any
provision of the CPR Rules, the provisions of this Article shall control.



62

<PAGE>   70
CONFIDENTIAL

(b) The arbitration shall be conducted by a three-arbitrator tribunal (the
"Tribunal"). Within thirty (30) Calendar Days after the commencement of the
arbitration, each Party shall appoint one arbitrator, and those two arbitrators
shall together appoint the third arbitrator as provided in CPR Rule 5.2. Each
arbitrator appointed by the Parties shall be knowledgeable and experienced in
contracting for technical systems and shall have senior management and/or
legal/judicial experience.

(c) Unless otherwise limited by the Tribunal or the agreement of the
Parties, the Parties shall be permitted to take discovery, if and as needed, by
deposition upon oral examination, requests for production of documents and
things, and requests for entry upon land for inspection and other purposes, as
those discovery methods are described and defined in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure; provided, however, that any limitations in the Federal Rules on the
number, timing, or sequence of such discovery requests shall not apply. The
scope of permissible discovery shall generally be as described in Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure Rule 26(b)(1), but the Parties shall use their best efforts
to focus and limit their discovery in accordance with the nature of the dispute
and the need for expedited resolution. The Tribunal may expand or limit the
scope of permissible discovery, establish the time period within which discovery
responses must be served, and expand or limit the type and number of discovery
methods and requests as it shall determine is appropriate in the circumstances,
taking into account the needs of the Parties and the desirability of making
discovery expeditious and cost-effective. The Tribunal may issue orders to
protect the confidentiality of proprietary information, trade secrets, and other
similar information disclosed in discovery and may order that discovery not be
had or that discovery may be had only on specific terms and conditions.

(d) Time is of the essence in the initiation and completion of the
arbitration. The arbitral hearing shall be commenced and conducted
expeditiously. Unless the Tribunal orders otherwise, the Dispute should be
submitted to the Tribunal for decision within two (2) months after the
commencement of the arbitration, and the final award shall be rendered within
one (1) month thereafter. The Parties and the Tribunal shall use their best
efforts to comply with this schedule, and the Tribunal may impose any remedy it
deems just for any Party's effort to unnecessarily delay, complicate or hinder
the proceedings.

(e) The arbitration shall be held in Washington, D.C., USA.

(f) Any arbitration proceeding held pursuant to this Article shall be
governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 et seq., and
judgment upon the award rendered by the Tribunal may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof.

(g) The Tribunal's award may grant any remedy or relief that the Tribunal
deems just and equitable and within the scope of this Contract, including
specific performance or other equitable relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Tribunal shall have no power or authority to amend or disregard any
provision of this Article 22.2 (Arbitration) or any other provision of the
Contract; in particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Tribunal shall not have the power or authority to exclude the right of a
Party to terminate this Contract when a



63

<PAGE>   71
CONFIDENTIAL

Party would otherwise have such right. The Tribunal also shall have no power or
authority to award punitive or exemplary damages to any Party.

(h) The non-prevailing Party, as determined by the Tribunal, shall pay the
costs of the arbitration and the prevailing Party's fees and expenses incurred
with respect to the arbitration, including reasonable attorneys' fees as
determined by the Tribunal. In the event of an arbitration involving multiple
claims with different Parties prevailing on each claim, the Tribunal shall
apportion the expenses and fees between or among the Parties in such manner as
it deems reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the
nature of the claims, and the result of the arbitration.

(i) At any time more than ten (10) Calendar Days before the commencement of
the hearing, any Party defending against any claim may serve upon the adverse
Party an offer to allow an award to be entered against the defending Party on
any claim for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer. If
within ten (10) Calendar Days after the service of the offer, the adverse Party
serves written notice that it accepts the offer, either Party may file the offer
and acceptance with the Tribunal, which will thereupon promptly enter an award
on the claim as provided in the offer. An offer not accepted shall be deemed
withdrawn and shall not be admissible into evidence except with respect to a
determination of fees and expenses. If the award finally made on the claim is
not equal to or more favorable than the offer, then for the purpose of
apportioning expenses and fees pursuant to this Article 22.2 (Arbitration), the
Party making the offer shall be deemed the Prevailing Party with respect to such
claim.

(j) If at the time any Dispute arises, the Center for Public Resources no
longer provides rules or services with respect to the arbitration of business
disputes, then the Parties hereto agree that the arbitration shall be conducted
before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Such arbitration shall be
conducted pursuant to the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules then effective,
provided, however, that in the event of any inconsistency with the AAA rules and
this Article, the provisions of this Article shall control.

22.3 LITIGATION.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 22.1 (Informal Dispute
Resolution) and Article 22.2 (Arbitration) above, if the Dispute requires that
immediate equitable relief or relief in aid of arbitration be obtained, either
Party shall have the right to bring suit at any time to obtain preliminary or
temporary injunctive relief, including specific performance, but requests for
permanent injunctive relief shall be arbitrated pursuant to Article 22.2
(Arbitration).

(1)  Any such suit shall be brought in a court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of Virginia, provided, however,
that the exclusive venue for any action brought in a
Virginia state court shall be the Circuit Court for Fairfax
County, and the Parties hereby waive any objection to that
venue. The Parties hereby irrevocably consent to personal
jurisdiction in the state and federal courts in the State of
Virginia concerning any Dispute between the Parties. If, for
any reason, the state and federal courts of Virginia do not
have or refuse to exercise jurisdiction over the Dispute,
then litigation



64

<PAGE>   72
CONFIDENTIAL

as permitted herein may be brought in any court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States of America, or if there is
no such court, in any other nation.

(2)  In the event a Party files a lawsuit pursuant to this
Article 22.3 (Litigation), the Prevailing Party is entitled
to an award of its costs and fees, including reasonable
attorney's fees, incurred with respect to the lawsuit. The
defendant in such litigation shall be regarded as the
Prevailing Party if either the court denies the equitable
relief sought on the merits or the court otherwise decides
that equitable relief is not warranted or the matter should
be resolved by arbitration.

(b) In the event an entity or person not subject to the provisions of this
Article 22 (Dispute Resolution) commences any litigation or proceeding against
any Party hereto in which the other Party hereto is an indispensable party, the
Party against which the litigation or proceeding is brought may join or attempt
to join the other Party in such litigation or proceeding notwithstanding the
provisions of Article 22.2 (Arbitration). For the purposes of this provision,
the other Party is an indispensable party in the lawsuit or proceeding if (i) in
its absence complete relief could not be accorded among those already a party to
the lawsuit or proceeding; (ii) its absence may as a practical matter impair or
impede its ability to protect its interests relating to the subject of the
lawsuit or proceeding; or (iii) its absence may leave the Party against which
the litigation or proceeding is brought subject to a substantial risk of
incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of
the interest of the other Party relating to the subject of the lawsuit or
proceeding.

(c) Nothing in this Contract precludes a Party prevailing on any claim,
whether in arbitration or litigation, from initiating litigation in any
appropriate forum to enter or enforce a judgment based on the Tribunal's or
court's award on that claim.

22.4 CONTINUED PERFORMANCE.

Pending final resolution of any Dispute, each Party shall, unless directed
otherwise by the other Party in writing, fulfill all its obligations under this
Contract, including the obligation to take all steps necessary during the
pendency of the Dispute to ensure the Work will be performed within the time
stipulated or within such extended time as may be allowed under this Contract,
provided Owner shall continue to make payments of undisputed sums therefore in
accordance with this Contract (including the dispute resolution provisions
hereof), and further provided that, if Owner fails to make such undisputed
payments or the amount of disputed payments withheld by Owner exceeds Three
Million Dollars ($3,000,000), Contractor may stop Work as permitted by Article
5.9 (Contractor's Right to Suspend the Work).

25. DEFAULT AND CORRECTION PLAN

25.1 MATERIAL BREACH.

Contractor commits a material breach of this Contract, Owner shall be entitled
to deliver to Contractor a written demand that it correct such breach.
Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of Owner's notice within one Business Day.
In the event Owner does not receive such acknowledgement within three (3)
Business Days of the date of the original notice, Owner shall send a second
notice within five (5) Business Days of the transmittal of the first notice.
Within ten (10) Business Days of the date of Owner's first notice, or such
longer time as Owner in its sole discretion may establish (such establishment
may be after Contractor's reasonable request for an extension of such date),
Contractor shall submit to Owner, for Owner's review, comment and approval, a
Correction Plan; provided, however, no Correction Plan shall ever result in a
change to a Key Task in an Initial City Schedule or the Acceptance Date (as may
be extended pursuant to this Contract) unless the Parties so agree in accordance
with Article 28.3 (Amendments). In the event Owner does not approve the
Correction Plan, Contractor shall, within five (5) Business Days after receipt
of Owner's written comments, incorporate all of Owner's reasonable comments into
the Correction Plan and resubmit the Correction Plan to Owner for review and
approval. Owner shall promptly approve such Correction Plan provided Contractor
has incorporated therein Owner's reasonable comments. Upon Owner's approval of

compliance with all the terms of such Correction Plan. With respect to the
breach for which Owner approved a Correction Plan, Owner shall not deliver to
Contractor a Notice of Default so long as Contractor performs in accordance with
the terms of such Plan.

(b) Unless Contractor has otherwise cured the breach in question, Owner may
terminate this Contract to the extent permitted by paragraph (f) of Article 26.2

reasonably determines it can recover from such failure within thirty (30)
Calendar Days thereof so that every Key Task set forth in the Initial City
Schedule to be completed after such thirty (30) Calendar-Day Period can be
completed in accordance with the Initial City Schedule, Contractor need not
submit a Correction Plan to Owner. In the event Contractor fails to complete any
Key Task in accordance with the schedule set forth in any Initial City Schedule,
and Contractor reasonably determines it cannot recover from such failure within
thirty (30) Calendar Days thereof so that every Key Task set forth in the
Initial City Schedule to be completed after such thirty (30) Calendar-Day Period
can be completed in accordance with the Initial City Schedule, Contractor shall
submit to Owner a Correction Plan, including a revised schedule reasonably
demonstrating that it can achieve

submits a Correction Plan reasonably demonstrating that it can achieve
Acceptance of the affected City Network by the Acceptance Date, Owner shall

Plan, the default shall be deemed cured upon Contractor's compliance with all
the terms of the Correction Plan. With respect to the breach for which Owner
approved a Correction Plan, Owner shall not deliver to Contractor a Notice of
Default so long as Contractor performs in accordance with the terms of such
Plan.

in accordance with an Initial City Schedule, Contractor fails to either recover
from its failure to achieve a Key Task so that every Key Task that is set forth
in the Initial City Schedule to be completed after such thirty (30) Calendar-Day
period can be completed in accordance with the Initial City Schedule, or
Contractor fails to submit a Correction Plan reasonably demonstrating it can
achieve Acceptance of the affected City Network in accordance with the
Acceptance Date (as may be extended pursuant to this Contract), and Contractor
fails to recover from either such failure within thirty (30) Calendar Days
notice thereof, Owner may terminate the Contract to the extent permitted by
paragraph (f) of Article 26.2 (Termination for Contractor Default).

(c) If Contractor fails to perform the work set forth in the Owner-approved
Correction Plan, in accordance with the revised schedule set forth therein, and
Contractor fails to cure such failure within thirty (30) Calendar Days of notice
thereof, Owner may terminate the Contract to the extent permitted by paragraph

1.0  INTRODUCTION

Under a license granted by the Federal Communications Commission, XM Satellite
Radio (XMSR) will launch two geo-synchronous satellites for the purpose of
delivering Digital Audio Broadcast Service (DARS) to all areas within the
Continental USA. To overcome signal blockage from terrain, foliage and man-made
structures, a network of terrestrial repeaters will be designed and built in a
total of 70 markets throughout the USA. The turnkey contractor for the 70
repeater networks will be LCC International (LCCI).

Because the DARS service will be a subscription service competing with
commercial AM and FM broadcasters in each market, the coverage reliability
provided by the combined satellite coverage and repeater coverage must be
extraordinarily high. To this end, XMSR has defined a coverage reliability
design goal of [   ] on primary and secondary traffic routes within each of the
70 markets. Due to the fact that repeater networks will be designed and
constructed prior to launch and activation of the satellites, a somewhat lower
initial coverage reliability guarantee is specified in the turnkey services
contract between XMSR and LCCI. This document describes the design and test
processes by which LCCI will meet the contractual coverage reliability
guarantee--and approach the [   ] coverage reliability goal to the maximum
practical extent.

1.1 COVERAGE RELIABILITY SPECIFICATION

The coverage reliability for certain areas and highways within the markets is
specified in Exhibit E of the Contract. These requirements are summarized below.

a) PRIMARY TRAFFIC ROUTES IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD):

Coverage reliability of [   ] over any single primary route, and no signal
outage greater than [   ] on any single primary route.

b) PRIMARY TRAFFIC ROUTES OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT:

Coverage reliability of [   ] over any single primary route, and no signal
outage greater than [   ] on any primary route.

c) SECONDARY TRAFFIC ROUTES ANYWHERE IN THE MARKET:

Coverage reliability of [   ] over the aggregate of all secondary routes, and no
signal outage greater than [    ] on any secondary route.

1.2 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Due to the high coverage reliability goal, RF design based on modeling tools
alone will not provide the degree of confidence required to meet the coverage
goals. Therefore, a [

] is required to fully characterize the design and
assure that the coverage requirements are met.

The measurement process requires the installation of a [
] on each potential repeater site and the use
of a [                                                ] to collect and store
signal strength data on traffic routes around that site. The signal strength
data will be processed and analyzed to determine the coverage that will be
provided by that site. The site-by-site coverage so determined will indicate the
degree of coverage required from adjacent sites (should the site be a part of a
cluster of sites). This is the measurements based design process that is
described herein.

2.0 DESIGN PROCESS

The design process is defined in two stages, Preliminary Coverage Design and
Revised Coverage Design. Included in the design process are non-coverage items
such as [
]

2.1 PRELIMINARY COVERAGE DESIGN PROCESS

The preliminary design process involves certain definitions, analyses and
approvals. The final result of the preliminary design process is the basis of
the field design activity that becomes the revised design.

The preliminary design analysis is done utilizing the [
] The [                       ] when optimized through a measurement
integration process, provides a means to estimate coverage from candidate sites,
to obtain a site count estimate and to select anchor sites for the commencement
of the revised design activity. The [    ] coverage analysis process is
described in Appendix A.

The following steps define the preliminary design process (responsible party
shown in parentheses):

2.2 REVISED COVERAGE DESIGN (IN MARKET)

The Revised Design begins with the [                     ] that are issued at
the end of the preliminary design process. Although [    ] will be used
extensively to predict coverage from candidate sites, the actual basis of the
revised design will be a measurements process. This basis of the measurement
process is described in Appendix B.

2.3 TRANSMIT TO RECEIVE ISOLATION

One of the technical considerations of site design is the potential for transmit
to receive interference due to the proximity of the transmit frequency to the
receive frequency. Although the transmitter will have [
] analysis and testing performed by LCC indicates
that certain site configurations could result in insufficient isolation margin.
Details of the isolation parameters and the Isolation Calculator Tool are
provided in Appendix C.

The following steps define the Isolation Analysis and Test Process:

-    [

















]

2.4 SIMULCAST ANALYSIS AND TEST

Under certain conditions, self-interference can result from a so-called
"simulcast condition". A harmful simulcast condition exists when the signal
level from two repeaters are within [    ] of each other and when the time delay
between the two repeaters exceeds [               ]. Prevention of harmful
simulcast conditions is a goal of the design process, and the detection of
potential harmful simulcast conditions is a goal

of the test process. The simulcast design and testing process are described in
Appendix D.

The following steps define the Simulcast Design Validation process:

-    [























]

2.5 RF EXPOSURE COMPLIANCE PLAN

In August 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revised the
telecommunications act for human exposures to Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR)
from the transmitters on wireless communication sites. The FCC adopted as their
standard a combination of the ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992 and NCRP 1986 standards which
is both preventative and precautionary in nature and applies to both
"Controlled/Occupational" and "Uncontrolled/General Population" exposures of
individuals - as defined in the FCC's OET Bulletin No. 65.

An RF Safety Plan has been submitted under Item RC-2 of the Contract--an
abstract of which is attached hereto as Appendix E. This safety plan fully
explains the regulatory background and the type and extent of RF exposure
analysis and testing.

The RF Exposure System Level Compliance Plan defines (a) the criteria for RF
Exposure regulatory compliance, (b) the pre-design guidelines, (c) the process
flow for regulatory management, and (d) the process for information
dissemination and training.

ESTABLISH CRITERIA FOR COMPLIANCE:

The criteria for RF Exposure Regulatory Compliance include definition of
Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Area including their exposure limits, and definition
of Near vs. Far field.

Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Area

In August 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revised the
telecommunications act for human exposures to Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR)
from the transmitters on wireless communication sites. The FCC adopted as their
standard a combination of the ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992 and NCRP 1986 standards which
is both preventative and precautionary in nature and applies to both
"Controlled/Occupational" and "Uncontrolled/General Population" exposures of
individuals - as defined in the FCC's OET Bulletin No. 65.

Occupational/controlled exposure limits apply to situations in which persons are
exposed as a consequence of their employment and in which those persons who are
exposed have been made fully aware of the potential for exposure and can
exercise control over their exposure. Example, a technician performing
maintenance at a site.

General population/uncontrolled exposure limits apply to situations in which the
general public may be exposed or in which persons who are exposed as a
consequence of their employment may not be made fully aware of the potential for
exposure or cannot exercise control over their exposure. For example, people in
a residential area being exposed by a telecommunications site.

4.1 IDENTIFICATION AND RANKING OF CANDIDATE SITES.

For the Search Rings in each City, Contractor shall perform the
following:

(a) Candidate Identification. In the course of performing Site
Acquisition Services, Contractor shall, as an initial matter, identify three
candidates for Normal-Area Sites, up to two candidates for Medium-Area Sites
and one candidate for Wide-Area Sites (as those sites are defined in Exhibit C)
(provided that Contractor may use only one candidate Site when it meets Owner's
requirements from the outset) within each Search Ring identified in the
Preliminary City Network Design. For each Search Ring, Contractor shall
identify and evaluate candidate Sites as Primary Sites and secondary candidate
Sites based on the following criteria: (i) compliance with the Site Lease
Agreement Term Sheet provided by Owner to Contractor by letter dated June 11,
1999; (ii) availability of zoning; (iii) site constructability (including
preliminary structural, environmental suitability and accessibility to power
and grounding); and (iv) ability to minimize the need to perform RF
interference analysis. For each Primary Site evaluated and identified, the
deliverable shall be a completed copy of Contractor's standard Candidate Site
Ranking Form and Site Survey Form. For alternate candidate Sites evaluated and
identified, Contractor shall provide Owner a completed copy of Contractor's
standard Candidate Site Ranking Form and Site Survey Form, but only to the
extent completed by Contractor In the event Contractor is unable to identify a
Primary Site from the candidate Sites initially identified pursuant to this
paragraph and/or the Work required to complete a Primary Site identified from
such candidate Sites cannot be completed, Contractor will notify Owner and the
Parties will review the situation and, upon Contractor's recommendation and
Owner's written concurrence, Contractor shall either continue efforts to
identify a Primary Site within the Search Ring or disqualify the Search Ring
and redesign and reissue the Search Ring.

(b) Site Qualification. Contractor shall "Caravan" candidate Sites,
that is, obtain RF Engineering acceptance and rank candidate Sites for initial
suitability with respect to RF Engineering, Site Acquisition, Architecture and
Engineering, Zoning,

select a Primary Candidate Site. The Site so selected shall be called a
"Primary Candidate Site" or a "Primary Site." For each Search Ring, the
deliverable shall be a completed copy of Contractor's standard Candidate Site
Ranking Form and the selection of such Primary Candidate Site, which shall be
reported on Contractor's Project Milestone Tracking Report (WINDS). The
completed Site Ranking Form shall identify those candidate Sites that likely
cannot be constructed as Standard Sites. In the event Contractor has performed
the services described in this paragraph within a Search Ring on three (3)
Primary Sites if Normal-Area Sites, two (2) Primary Sites if Medium-Area Sites
and one (1) Primary Site if Wide-Area Sites and all of such Primary Sites have
been abandoned or disqualified through no fault of Contractor, then Contractor
shall notify Owner and provide Owner with its recommendation as to how to
proceed. Contractor shall not, without Owner's prior written approval, perform
the services under this paragraph within a Search Ring for more than three (3)
Primary Sites if Normal-Area Sites, two (2) Primary Sites if Medium-Area Sites
and one (1) Primary Site if Wide-Area Site.

4.2   SITE LEASE AGREEMENTS.

ISOLATION SPECIFICATIONS


1.0  Introduction

Contractor shall design repeater sites in such a way as to prevent degradation
of the satellite signal by the repeater transmitted signal. Contractor shall
position antennas so that there is sufficient isolation to maintain transmitter
interference below the calculated maximum allowed interference, including a
margin. Calculations of maximum interference shall be site specific, using
satellite power levels for the geographic area and repeater transmit power
associated with each specific site.

2.0  Specification Parameters

Contractor shall pre-calculate the interference level using the design site
parameters (fixed and variable) developed under the Interim Services Agreement
and approved by Owner. The critical parameter will be the "Required C/(N+I)
parameter," which shall be used as the baseline signal at the receive antenna
port for acceptable operation.

Contractor will develop for Owner's approval two sample isolation calculations
using the fixed and variable parameters. The calculation result shown on the
"Isolation Margin" line shall determine if the site configuration is a)
acceptable without isolation measurements, b) requires measurement or c) must be
reconfigured for better isolation performance.

The process for performing actual calculations and measurements is provided in
Exhibit A, Attachment 1.

(a)       M1: Ninety percent (90%) of the Project Management Fixed
Price Amount shall be payable in equal monthly installments
("Work Unit M1") based on the estimated site count of 1,578
Sites (for all Cities) amortized over the term of the
Contract and is subject to a one-time final adjustment upon
the "Project Completion Date" (defined as the date upon
which all Cities have achieved Acceptance and all Work has
been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the
requirements of the Contract) pursuant to Section 2.1.2
below. The total monthly installment for all Sites across
all Cities is equal to:

(1,578 Sites x [           ]/N months (where N equals the
number of full months from Notice to Proceed to [

Payment for such monthly installment shall commence on the
first full month following the date a Notice to Proceed is
deemed to be issued pursuant to Article 3.2 of the Terms
and Conditions.

(b)       M2: The remaining ten percent (10%) of the Program
Management Fixed Price Amount ("Work Unit M2") for the
actual number of Sites completed across all Cities shall be
paid at Project Completion Date and is calculated as
follows:

M2 = (Actual Number of Sites at Project Completion Date x
[          ].

2.1.2     FINAL ADJUSTMENT TO AGGREGATE MONTHLY INSTALLMENT
AMOUNT

The aggregate amount paid in monthly installments by Owner to
Contractor will be adjusted to account for any change in the number of Sites
from 1,578 to the actual number of completed Sites across all Cities at the
Project Completion Date, it being understood that in no event shall the total
amount paid under this Section 2 for Project Management exceed the Project
Management Fixed Price Amount multiplied by the actual Site count at Project
Completion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractor will be entitled to a
percentage of the Project Management Fixed Price Amount equal to the Project
Management Services Work completed for any Site that is cancelled by Owner
through no fault of Contractor.

The final adjustment will be determined as follows:

(a)   If the number of Sites at Project
Completion Date is greater than 1,578,
Owner shall pay Contractor, within thirty
(30) days of the Project Completion Date,
the amount equal to [             ] x (A -
S)) where A is the number of actual
completed Sites at Project Completion Date
and S equals 1,578.

(b)   If the number of completed Sites at Project
Completion Date is less than 1,578, Owner
shall be entitled to an amount equal to
[             ] x (S - A)) where S

EXHIBIT E - NETWORK TESTING AND
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

1. DEFINITIONS. As used in this Exhibit E:

A.   "Central Business District" or "CBD" shall mean, for each City, that
geographic area on which is situated a substantial portion of that
City's business and through which travels a substantial portion of the
City's vehicular traffic and for which there is a high probability
that Owner's satellites, when properly launched and functioning in
accordance with their specification, will not provide adequate
coverage. As of EDC, the CBD for certain Cities is set forth in
Attachment 1 hereto. On or before EDC plus thirty (30) Calendar Days,
Owner will identify the CBDs for the remaining Cities. The CBD
identification shall be incorporated into the Contract by an Amendment
in accordance with Article 28.3 of the Terms and Conditions.

B.   "Drive Test Route" shall mean, with respect to a City, those
thoroughfares within the Defined Coverage Area on which a substantial
portion of the City's vehicular traffic (including commuter traffic)
travels and from which Contractor shall test the City Network. The
Drive Test Routes consist of the aggregate of the individual Primary
Drive Test Routes and Secondary Drive Test Routes. As of EDC, the
Drive Test Routes for certain Cities are as set forth in Attachment 2
hereto. The Parties shall mutually agree on the Drive Test Routes for
the remainder of the Cities on or before EDC plus thirty (30) Calendar
Days. The Drive Test Routes for such remaining Cities shall be roughly
equivalent to, and as comprehensive as, those set forth in Attachment
2 hereto and such Drive Test Routes shall be incorporated into the
Contract by an Amendment in accordance with Article 28.3 of the Terms
and Conditions.

C.   "Defined Coverage Area" shall have the meaning set forth in Section
3.2 of Exhibit B (SOW).

D.   "Primary Drive Test Route" shall mean, with respect to either a City
or a CBD of a City, a series of individual traffic routes on which
there is the highest density of a City's vehicular traffic (including
commuter traffic) and from which Contractor shall test the City
Network. As of the Effective Date, the Primary Drive Test Routes for
certain Cities and CBDs are as set forth in Attachment 2 hereto. The
Parties shall mutually agree on the Drive Test Routes for the
remainder of the Cities and CBDs on or before EDC plus thirty (30)
Calendar Days. The Primary

Drive Test Routes for such remaining Cities shall be roughly
equivalent to, and as comprehensive as, those set forth in Attachment
2 hereto and such Primary Drive Test Routes shall be incorporated into
the Contract by an Amendment in accordance with Article 28.3 of the
Terms and Conditions.

E.   "Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria" shall mean the criteria against
which a City Network shall be tested, and the conformity to which
shall indicate that Contractor has successfully completed the Repeater
Acceptance Test with respect to such City Network. The Repeater
Acceptance Test Criteria are set forth in Section 2.B below.

F.   "Secondary Drive Test Route" shall mean a Drive Test Route that is not
a Primary Drive Test Route. As of the Effective Date, the Secondary
Drive Test Route for certain Cities and CBDs are as set forth in
Attachment 2 hereto. The Parties shall mutually agree on the Drive
Test Routes for the remainder of the Cities and CBDs on or before EDC
plus thirty (30) Calendar Days. The Secondary Drive Test Routes for
such remaining Cities shall be roughly equivalent to, and as
comprehensive as, those set forth in Attachment 2 hereto and such
Secondary Drive Test Routes shall be incorporated into the Contract by
an Amendment in accordance with Article 28.3 of the Terms and
Conditions.

G.   "Signal Reliability" shall mean that the Repeater Network Acceptance
Testing verifies a signal level greater than [       ]

H.   "Signal Outage" shall mean any testing distance interval during which
the Repeater Acceptance Testing verifies a signal level at or below
[       ]

2. REPEATER NETWORK ACCEPTANCE TESTING

A.   In accordance with Article 8.1 of the Contract, Contractor shall
perform Repeater Network Acceptance Testing with respect to each City
Network in accordance with the Repeater Acceptance Test Plan and
Procedures, including testing intervals and test equipment
configuration(s) to be used by Contractor hereunder. Contractor shall
deliver to Owner for Owner's review and approval the Repeater
Acceptance Test Plan and Procedures on or before EDC plus thirty (30)
Calendar Days. Contractor shall incorporate Owner's reasonable
comments. The Owner-approved Repeater Acceptance Test Plan and
Procedures will be incorporated into the Contract as Attachment 3
hereto by an Amendment in accordance with Article 28.3 of the Terms
and Conditions.

B.   A City Network shall be deemed to have no defects when the City
Network satisfies the following criteria (the "Repeater Acceptance
Test Criteria"):

(1)  For each individual Primary Drive Test Route in the Central
Business District of a City there is: (a) [
] Signal Reliability (excluding Exclusion Zones and those
areas reasonably determined to be

covered by signals from Owner's satellites) along the length of
each Primary Drive Test Route; and (b) no individual Signal
Outage greater than [                             ]

(2)  For each individual Primary Drive Test Route outside the Central
Business District of a City there is: (a) [
] Signal Reliability (excluding Exclusion Zones and those
areas reasonably determined to be covered by signals from Owner's
satellites) along the length of each Primary Drive Test Route;
and (b) no individual Signal Outage greater than [
]

(3)  For the aggregate of the Secondary Drive Test Routes for a City,
there is: (a) [                          ] Signal Reliability
(excluding Exclusion Zones and those areas reasonably determined
to be covered by signals from Owner's satellites) along the
aggregate of the lengths of such Secondary Drive Test Routes; and
(b) no individual Signal Outage greater than [
]

3. WITNESS OF REPEATER ACCEPTANCE TESTING. For each City Network, and in
accordance with this Exhibit E, the following shall apply: (i) Owner shall be
entitled to attend and witness all testing performed hereunder; and (ii)
Contractor shall provide Owner with fourteen (14) Calendar Days prior written
notice of commencement of any such testing.

4. REPEATER ACCEPTANCE TEST REPORT. With respect to each City Network, within
twenty-one (21) Calendar Days after Contractor's completion of all testing
performed in accordance with this Exhibit E, Contractor shall provide to Owner
the Repeater Acceptance Test Report. The Repeater Acceptance Test Report shall
set forth the following: (i) for each set of routes set forth in Sections B.1,
B.2, and B.3 above, respectively, an RF coverage plot showing the location of
each measurement and whether or not such measurement proves Signal Reliability;
(ii) for each set of routes set forth in Sections B.1, B.2, and B.3 above,
respectively, a graph of distance against signal strength showing where
measurements prove or fail to prove Signal Reliability; and (iii) for the City
Network, detailed analysis showing whether or not the City Network meets the
Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria set forth above.

5. CERTIFICATION. In the event the Repeater Acceptance Test Report states that
the City Network meets the Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria set forth above,
concurrent with Contractor's delivery of such report, Contractor shall provide
to Owner a detailed report setting forth the test results and a certification in
the form of Attachment 3 (Form of Certification for Acceptance) hereto. In the
event the Repeater Acceptance Test Report sets forth that the City Network fails
to meet the Repeater Acceptance Test Criteria set forth above, the Parties shall
proceed to correct the City Network in accordance with Article 8.1 (c) of the
Contract (as if Owner had delivered to Contractor an undisputed Notice of
Defects).

6. NOTICE OF ACCEPTANCE. Owner shall provide Contractor notice of its acceptance
of the City Network or Notice of Defects thereof in accordance with Article 8 of
the Terms and Conditions.

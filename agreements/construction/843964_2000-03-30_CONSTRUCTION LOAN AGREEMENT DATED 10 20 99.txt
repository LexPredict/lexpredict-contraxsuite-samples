accordance with the provisions of the Notes or this Agreement, shall be
made as follows:

calendar month following the Initial Advance and on the first
Business Day of each calendar month thereafter through and
including the calendar month in which the Maturity Date

the Mortgage Note or this Agreement, together with all accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable in full

interest is due under the Mortgage Note) to disburse to itself from the
undisbursed proceeds of the Construction Loan all then accrued and
unpaid interest on the Construction Loan, and Lender agrees to disburse
Construction Loan proceeds to itself to pay such interest, provided all
conditions precedent to such disbursement as set forth in this
Agreement are satisfied; provided, however, that neither such
authorization nor agreement shall be deemed to limit, reduce or
otherwise affect Borrower's obligation to pay interest if (a) there are
no remaining amounts in the Budget allocated for the payment of
interest (including Reserves specifically allocated to pay interest),
or (b) Lender is entitled to withhold disbursement of the Construction
Loan for any reason. Any amounts disbursed from the interest reserve

amounts then owing by Borrower to Lender shall bear interest at the
Default Rate.

3.5 Late Charge. If any payment of interest or principal due
under the Notes is not made within ten days after such payment is due,
then, in addition to the payment of the amount so due, Borrower shall
pay to Lender a "late charge" equal to five percent (5.0%) of the
amount of that payment or $25.00, whichever is greater, to compensate
Lender for the cost of collecting and handling such late payment.

3.6 Fees. Lender has fully earned a non-refundable loan and
administration fee in the amount of $52,500.00, and, concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement, the unpaid balance of such fee shall
be due and payable by Borrower.

3.7      Letter of Credit; Letter of Credit Fees and Cash
Collateral.

(a) Concurrently with the Initial Advance, Lender
shall issue the Letter of Credit on Lender's standard form and
otherwise in form and substance acceptable to Lender in an
aggregate amount of $3,000,000; provided, however, that prior
to and as a condition to Lender being obligated to issue the
Letter of Credit, Borrower shall pay to Lender an issuance fee
equal to $30,000 and such issuance fee shall be deemed to be
fully earned upon the payment thereof. Provided that the
Letter of Credit is then outstanding, on October 20, 2000,
January 20, 2001, April 20, 2001 and July 20, 2001, Borrower
shall pay to Lender

<PAGE>

a quarterly fee equal to $7,500, which such fee shall be
deemed to be fully earned upon the payment thereof.

(b) Any amounts disbursed by Lender under the Letter
of Credit at any time and from time to time shall be deemed
disbursements of proceeds of the Loans and shall be due and
payable by Borrower to Lender at the times and in the manner
set forth in the Demand Note.

(c) If the Letter of Credit is outstanding prior to
Maturity Date, but subsequent to the repayment in full of the
Construction Loan, then upon the consummation of each sale of
a Unit Interest, Borrower shall deliver cash collateral equal
to 50% of the Net Sales Proceeds with respect to such Unit
Interest shall be delivered to Lender. If the Letter of Credit
is outstanding on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Maturity Date (or if an amount has then been drawn on the
Letter of Credit which has not been reimbursed or repaid),
Lender may demand delivery of cash collateral in an amount
equal to the then outstanding Letter of Credit Liability, and
such cash collateral may be retained by Lender until such time
as the Letter of Credit Liability is reduced to $0. Lender may
apply any such cash collateral to the payment of any amounts
thereafter drawn on the Letters of Credit which have not been
reimbursed or repaid to Lender by Borrower. The failure to
deliver any such cash collateral upon demand shall constitute

5.       DISBURSEMENT OF THE LOAN.

5.1 Conditions Precedent. In addition to the other conditions
set forth herein, the obligation of Lender to make the initial and each
subsequent disbursement of the Construction Loan under this Agreement
shall be conditioned upon and subject to the payment to Lender of all
loan fees then owing from Borrower to Lender and to satisfaction of all
of the following conditions:

(a) All representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents shall be true
in all material respects on and as of the date of such
disbursement.

(b) Borrower shall have performed all of its
obligations under all Loan Documents which are required to be
performed on or prior to the date of such disbursement.

(c) The Construction Loan shall not be "out of

of balance."

financial condition of Borrower as reasonably determined by
Lender.

(e) No Event of Default shall have occurred that has
not been waived in writing by Lender, and no Unmatured Default

Work. The proceeds of the Construction Loan disbursed to Borrower shall
be used by Borrower solely for the purpose of paying (or reimbursement
to others for payment of) items of Project Cost actually incurred by
Borrower, and, in connection therewith, no Project Cost shall include
expenses relating to any development, construction, operating or other
cost attributable to any project other than the Project specifically
described in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, all inspections of the Work made by Lender,
the Consultant or their respective agents, employees and designees
shall be solely for Lender's own information and shall not be deemed to
have been made for or on account of Borrower or any other party.
Borrower hereby specifically relieves Lender of any and all liability
or responsibility relating in any way whatsoever to the construction of
the Project, including but not limited to, the work thereat, the
material or labor supplied in connection therewith, and any errors,
inconsistencies or other defects in the Project or the Plans and
Specifications.

5.3      Disbursement Requests.


15
<PAGE>

(a) Borrower shall request and Lender shall be
required to make disbursement of the Construction Loan not
more frequently than once each calendar month. Lender may at
any time take such action as it deems appropriate to verify
that the conditions precedent to each disbursement have been
satisfied, including, without limitation, verification of any
amounts due under the Construction Contract or any
Subcontract. Borrower agrees to cooperate with Lender in any
such action. If in the course of any such verification, any
amount shown on any contract or subcontract entered into for
the performance of any portion of the Work, or any application
for payment, sworn statement or waiver of lien is subject to a
possible discrepancy, such discrepancy shall be eliminated by
Borrower to Lender's satisfaction. Each request for
disbursement shall be made by a letter from the chief
financial officer of the Borrower, addressed to Lender,
specifying in detail the amount and mode of each disbursement
and accompanied by the following, all in form and substance
satisfactory to Lender:

(i)  An Owner's Sworn Statement and
disbursement request;

(ii) A Contractor's Application for Payment
and Sworn Contractor's Statement from Contractor, and
a statement of a duly authorized officer of
Contractor that all items of construction cost have
been incorporated into the Project in accordance with
the Plans and Specifications, together with waivers
of lien with respect to the current disbursement and
all previous disbursements from Contractor and all
subcontractors and materialmen to whom payment is to
be made, as are required by the Title Company as a
condition to issuing the date-down endorsement
described in subparagraph 5.3(b) below;

(iii) A certificate of the Architect
certifying (based on its diligent investigation of
the Project and the Work then performed) (A) that all
construction to the date of the request for
disbursement has been completed in accordance with
the Plans and Specifications; (B) the percentage of
completion of each component of the Work; (C) its
approval of the request for disbursement; (D) that
there has been no material deviation from the
contract amount under the Construction Contract or
any Subcontract or from the projected time of
completion of any component of the Work; and (E) the
total construction cost to complete the construction
of the Project and that after giving effect to all
amounts previously certified for payment, plus the
amount then requested, the remaining uncertified and
undisbursed funds shall be sufficient to pay all
costs required to complete the construction of the
Project in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications; and

(iv) An inspection report of the Consultant
certifying the percentages of completion of the
components of the Work and setting forth the amount
authorized for disbursement and such other matters as


16
<PAGE>

Lender may require (including compliance with the
Plans and Specifications). (It is understood and
agreed by Borrower that any and all inspections of
the Work made by Lender, the Consultant or their
respective agents, employees and/or designees shall
be solely for Lender's own information and shall not
be deemed to have been made for or on account of
Borrower or any other party, and that Lender shall
have no liability or responsibility relating in any
way whatsoever to the construction of the Project,
including, but not limited to, the work thereon, the
material or labor supplied in connection therewith,
and any errors, inconsistencies or other defects in
the Plans and Specifications.)

(v)     Such other documents, assignments,
certificates and opinions as are required by the
Title Company, or as may be reasonably required by
Lender.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Lender shall not be required to
make any disbursement of the Construction Loan pursuant to
this Agreement until the Title Company is prepared to issue an
endorsement to the Title Policy, updating the same to the date
of such disbursement and increasing the amount of coverage
(including mechanic lien coverage) thereunder to the Principal
Balance (taking into account the then current disbursement),
and insuring the lien of the Mortgage to be superior to all
defects in title other than the Permitted Exceptions and other
exceptions hereafter approved by Lender in writing.

(c) No disbursement of any amount shown in the Budget
as a contingency reserve shall by made without Lender's
approval with respect to the type and amount of the requested
expenditure, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

5.4 Certifications, Representations and Warranties. Each
request for disbursement by Borrower shall constitute (a) Borrower's
certification that the representations and warranties contained in
Article 6 below are true and correct in all material respects as of the
date of such request, (b) Borrower's certification that Borrower is in
compliance with the conditions contained in this Article 5, and (c)
Borrower's representation and warranty to Lender, with respect to the
Work, materials and other items for which payment is requested that (i)
such Work and materials have been incorporated into the Project, free
and clear of liens and encumbrances, (ii) the value thereof is as
estimated therein, (iii) such Work and materials substantially conform
to the Plans and Specifications, this Agreement and all Applicable
Laws, and (iv) the requisitioned value of such Work and materials and
the amounts of all other items of cost for which payment is requested
by Borrower have theretofore been in fact paid for in cash by Borrower
or the same are then due and owing by Borrower and (unless Lender
disburses funds directly to the parties performing the Work or to the
Title Company) will in fact be paid in cash by Borrower within five
days after Borrower's receipt of the


17
<PAGE>

requested disbursement. Neither review nor approval by Lender of
requests for disbursement or any information contained therein or any
other information provided to Lender in accordance with the other
provisions of this Article 5 shall constitute the acceptance or
approval by Lender of any portion of the Work.

5.5 Amount of Disbursements; Retainage. Subject to the other
conditions and limitations set forth herein, the amount of each
disbursement shall be the amount requested by Borrower; provided,
however, that (a) Lender shall have the right to retain 10% of each
"hard cost" item of Project Cost (other than amounts requested for
payment to suppliers of materials only who have either fully delivered
all materials or delivered such portion thereof whereby it is
reasonable and necessary to fully pay for such materials)(the
"Retainage"), which Retainage shall be disbursed in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5.10 below, and (b) in no event shall Lender be
obligated to disburse for any item an amount in excess of the amount
allocated for such item pursuant to the Budget, including any Reserve
set aside specifically for such item as provided in Section 5.7 below.

5.6 Costs. For purposes of this Agreement, including without
limitation, Section 5.2 hereof, (a) the cost of labor and material
furnished for the Work shall be deemed to be incurred by Borrower when
the labor and material have been incorporated into the Project and the
payment therefor is due and payable, (b) the cost of services (other
than labor included in the Work) shall be deemed to be incurred by
Borrower when the services are actually rendered and the payment
therefor is due and payable, (c) real estate taxes, interest and
insurance premiums shall be deemed to be incurred by Borrower when such
items become due and payable, and (d) any other costs shall be deemed
to be incurred by Borrower when the payment therefor is due and
payable, but not before the value to be received in return for such
cost has been received by Borrower.

5.7 Reserves. In addition to any reserves for specific line
items that are already established in the Budget, Lender may establish
and set aside out of the undisbursed proceeds of the Construction Loan,
reserves (collectively, the "Reserves") in such amounts as may be
reasonably estimated by Lender from time to time to provide for payment
of the items of Project Cost as the same may accrue or become payable
prior to the repayment in full of the Construction Loan. Amounts set
aside as Reserves shall not be available for disbursement to Borrower
for any purpose other than payment of the item or group or items for
which the Reserve was established. Based upon the facts then available
to Lender, Lender may adjust and reallocate the amount of any Reserve
from time to time. Items for which Reserves may be established shall
include (i) Loan Expenses, (ii) interest on the Loans, (iii) real
estate taxes and assessments, (iv) premiums on insurance policies and
bonds (if any) required to be furnished by Borrower hereunder (v)
professional fees and (vi) promotion and sale costs.



18
<PAGE>

5.8 Loan In Balance. At all times prior to repayment of the
Loans in full, (a) the sum of the undisbursed Construction Loan
proceeds allocated to each line item in the Budget (including any
Reserve specifically set aside for such line item) must be sufficient,
in Lender's reasonable determination, to pay the unpaid costs and
expenses that will be incurred to complete such item, and (b) the
aggregate undisbursed Construction Loan proceeds, as set forth in the
Budget, must be sufficient, in Lender's reasonable determination, to
pay all unpaid Project Costs and all operating, management and other
expenses of the Property through the projected date on which all of the
Unit Interests will be sold (or such earlier date by which the Loans
will be fully repaid from the proceeds of sales of Unit Interests), as
such dates are reasonably determined by Lender from time to time.
Lender and Borrower mutually acknowledge that the Budget includes an
amount necessary to complete all of the Units. If Lender reasonably
determines that (i) the costs and expenses to complete any line item in
the Budget exceeds the remaining undisbursed Construction Loan proceeds
allocated therefor, or (ii) the remaining Project Costs and all
estimated operating, management and other expenses of the Project
through the projected date on which all of the Unit Interests will be
sold (or such earlier date by which the Loans will be fully repaid from
the proceeds of sales of Unit Interests), as such dates are reasonably
determined by Lender from time to time, exceeds the sum of the
aggregate undisbursed Construction Loan proceeds, as set forth in the
Budget, then the Construction Loan shall be deemed "out of balance" to
the extent of such excess. The Construction Loan shall also be deemed
to be "out of balance" if Lender reasonably determines that the
aggregate prices at which the Unit Interests can be sold are less than
the aggregate Minimum Sales Prices for the Unit Interests, and/or the
pace of the sales of the Unit Interests is slower than that projected
by Borrower when establishing the Budget, and, as a result of either of
such circumstances, there will not be sufficient revenue generated from
the Project to pay all of Borrower's obligations under the Loan
Documents as and when required. In the event that Lender determines
that the Construction Loan is out of balance, Borrower shall, within
five (5) days after written request by Lender, deposit with Lender the
amount reasonably required by Lender to eliminate the out-of-balance
deficiency, whereupon the sums thus deposited by Borrower with Lender
will be disbursed by Lender to complete the Work prior to any further
disbursement of Construction Loan proceeds (or, if the Work has been
completed, to the repayment of the outstanding principal balance of the
Loans and other amounts payable under the Loan Documents). No interest
shall be payable to Borrower on the amounts so deposited, nor to Lender
on such amounts when disbursed to pay the cost of any Work. Borrower
agrees to furnish to Lender, upon request, all information required by
Lender to make the determinations described in this Section.

5.9      Escrow; Application of Disbursements.

(a) Lender shall make each requested disbursement of the
Construction Loan through a construction escrow with the Title Company
within ten days after all of the conditions precedent to such
disbursement set forth in this Article have been satisfied (including
delivery of all documentation required under Section 5.3 above), except
that Lender, in its discretion, may make payments of Project Cost
directly to Borrower or to


19
<PAGE>

the person or entity Lender determines is entitled to such payment or
jointly to Borrower and such person or entity. The escrow agreement
governing such construction escrow shall be in form and substance
acceptable to Lender.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender shall not be
responsible, liable or obligated to the contractors, subcontractors,
suppliers, materialmen, laborers, architects, engineers, or any other
parties, for services or work performed, or for goods delivered by them
or any of them, in and upon the Land or employed directly or indirectly
in the performance of the Work, or for any debts or claims whatsoever
accruing in favor of any such parties and against Borrower or others,
or against the Project. It is expressly understood and agreed that
Borrower is not and shall not be an agent of Lender for any purpose
whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, advances
made at Lender's option, directly to any contractor, subcontractor or
supplier of labor or materials, or any other party, shall not be deemed
a recognition by Lender of any third party beneficiary status of any
such person or entity.

(c) Borrower covenants and agrees that it shall receive all
advances of Construction Loan proceeds to be made hereunder by Lender
as a trust fund and that Borrower shall withdraw and use said funds
solely for the payment of the bills for the labor and materials used in
the performance of the Work for which such Construction Loan funds were
requested by Borrower, and for the payment of the other items of
Project Cost for which such Construction Loan proceeds were requested
by Borrower, and for no other purpose whatsoever; however, nothing
herein shall impose upon Lender any obligation whatsoever to see to the
proper application of any such monies by Borrower.

(d) Whenever so requested by Lender, Borrower shall promptly
furnish Lender written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that
all monies theretofore advanced by Lender pursuant to this Agreement
have actually been paid or applied in payment of the cost of
performance of the Work and in payment of the other items of Project
Cost for which such funds were advanced by Lender, and until such
evidence is produced, at the option of Lender, no future or additional
payments or advances of Construction Loan funds need be made hereunder.

5.10 Release of Retainage.  Retainage(s) shall be released as
follows:

(a) Retainage on any Subcontract shall be released within
thirty days after such Subcontract has been fully performed and the
following conditions have been satisfied:

(i) Borrower has delivered final and unconditional
waivers of lien from the subcontractor whose individual
Subcontract has been fully performed to the Title Company with
copies to Lender;


20

(ii) All conditions precedent to disbursement of

(iii) Lender has received a certificate in writing

Subcontract has been fully and satisfactorily completed in
accordance with the Plans and Specifications, and in
compliance with all Applicable Laws, and the Consultant has
approved all such Work.

(b) Final disbursement of construction retainages to the
Contractor for the Work not previously released shall be made upon
satisfaction of the following conditions in addition to satisfaction of
the other conditions precedent for disbursement of proceeds of the
Construction Loan by Lender:

certificate in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of
the Contractor certifying that all obligations of the
Contractor under the Construction Contract and all obligations
of the subcontractors under the Subcontracts have been fully
performed, and (B) a certificate signed by the Architect,
certifying that the construction of the Work has been
completed in all respects in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications and the use and occupancy of the Project is
permitted under all Applicable Laws;

(ii) If requested by Lender, Lender shall have
received a certificate in writing signed by the Consultant
certifying that the construction of the Work has been
completed in all respects in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications and the use and occupancy of the Project is
permitted under all Applicable Laws;

(iii) Borrower has delivered to Lender all applicable
licenses or permits necessary for the use of the Project,
including without limitation, a final, unconditional
certificate of occupancy the Project;

(iv) Borrower has delivered to Lender original
policies of fire and extended coverage insurance as herein
required, with Lender named as mortgagee and as an additional
insured party and loss payee;

(v) The Title Company is unconditionally prepared to
issue its final updated ALTA loan policy of title insurance
covering the Principal Balance, subject only to the Permitted
Exceptions and other exceptions approved by Lender in writing,
and containing its final forms of Comprehensive Endorsement 1
and ALTA 3.1 Zoning Endorsement (without exception and based
on as-built conditions), full coverage against all mechanics'
liens and such other endorsements as are required under
Section 4.5 above;

(vi) Borrower has delivered to the Title Company and
Lender final and unconditional waivers of lien from the
Contractor and all subcontractors and


21

be valid and binding upon the parties that have executed the same in
accordance with the respective provisions thereof, and enforceable in
accordance with the respective provisions thereof, subject only to
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights. Execution,
delivery and performance of the Loan Documents do not and will not
contravene, conflict with, violate or constitute a default under the
Operating Agreement creating Borrower, the certificate of formation of
Borrower, or any Applicable Law or any agreement, indenture or
instrument to which Borrower, Member or Heartland is a party or is
bound or which is binding upon or applicable to the Project or any
portion thereof.

6.7 Litigation. There is not any condition, event or
circumstance existing, or any litigation, arbitration, governmental or
administrative proceeding, action, examination, claims or demand
pending or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge after due inquiry,
threatened affecting Borrower, Member or Heartland or the Project, or
involving the validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents or
involving any risk of a judgment or liability which, if satisfied,
would have an adverse effect on the financial condition, business or
properties of Borrower, Member or Heartland or the priority of the lien
of the Mortgage, or which would prevent Borrower or Member from
complying with or performing its obligations under this Agreement, the
Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents within the time limits set
forth therein for such compliance or performance and no basis for any
such matter exists.

6.8 Utilities; Authorities. All utilities necessary for use,
operation and occupancy of the Project (including, without limitation,
water, storm sewer, sanitary sewer and drainage, electric, gas and
telephone facilities) are available at the boundaries of the Land (or
in the streets adjoining the Land), and all requirements for the use of
such utilities have been fulfilled. All building, zoning, safety,
disabled persons, health, fire, water district, sewerage and
environmental protection agency permits and other licenses and permits
which are required by any governmental authority for construction of
the Improvements, and the use, occupancy and operation of the Project
in accordance with the Plans and Specifications have been obtained by

Obligor's debts as such debts become due, and has capital sufficient to
carry on such Obligor's present business transactions. The value of
each Obligor's property, at a fair valuation, is greater than the sum
of such Obligor's debts. No Obligor is bankrupt or insolvent, nor has
any Obligor made an assignment for the benefit of such Obligor's
creditors, nor has there been a trustee or receiver appointed for the
benefit of such Obligor's creditors, nor has there been any bankruptcy,
reorganization or insolvency proceedings instituted by or against any
Obligor, nor will any Obligor be rendered insolvent by such Obligor's

accounting principles consistently applied and fairly present the
financial condition of the Person to which they pertain and the other

parties or any covenants, conditions, easements, rights of way or
restrictions of record. Neither Borrower nor any agent thereof has
received any notice, written or otherwise, alleging any such violation,
which violation has not previously been cured. Upon completion of the
Work in accordance with the Plans and Specifications, the Project will
be in full compliance and conformity with all zoning requirements,
including without limitation, those relating to setbacks, height,
parking, floor area ratio, fire lanes and percentage of land coverage,
and will not be a non-conforming or special use.

Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986, 43 U.S.C. Section 11022, and
federal regulations promulgated thereunder. To Borrower's knowledge,
the Real Estate does not contain any underground storage tanks. The
Real Estate is not "real property" as the term is defined under Section
3 of the Responsible Property Transfer Act of 1988 (765 ILCS 90/1, et
seq.), as now or hereafter amended ("RPTA"). Neither the making of the

development or other agreements in existence that affect the Project,
other than those described in the schedule of Permitted Exceptions or
as described in Exhibit B of the Assignment of Plans.

All representations and warranties which have been made by Borrower in
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be true in all
respects at the time of each disbursement of the Construction Loan, and
in the event of any material breach, misrepresentation or omission,
Lender shall have the absolute right to terminate its obligations under
this Agreement (without any obligation to refund any loan or other fees
previously paid), and upon demand by Lender, Borrower shall reimburse
Lender for the Loan Expenses, and Lender shall be entitled to recover
from Borrower all losses and damages resulting therefrom.

7.       BORROWER'S COVENANTS.

limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower will cause
construction to continue without interruption until completion, and to

7.2 Certificate of Completion. Within fifteen days after each
Unit is completed, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a certificate of
the Architect stating that the Unit has been completed in accordance

written approval of Lender, make or permit any modification of the
Plans and Specifications, or amend or modify the Construction Contract,
the Architectural Contract or enter into any change orders or
additional contracts for the performance of any portion of the Work;
provided, however, Borrower shall have the right to enter into one or
more change orders without Lender's consent, so long as (a) no Event of

other Loan Documents, (b) the change order does not individually result
in a change in the cost of constructing the Project of more than
$50,000, (c) the change order does not, together with all other change
orders, result in a change in the cost of constructing the Project of
more than $200,000, (d) the change order does not affect any structural
portion of the Project, the overall appearance of the Project or the
use or operation of the Project in any material respect, and (e) any
increased cost resulting from the change order is paid for from the
contingency line item in the Budget. In any event, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender copies of all such change orders not requiring
Lender's prior approval, together with all related documentation, no
later than ten days after the execution thereof. Except to the extent
expressly permitted in this Section, Borrower shall not, without the
prior written approval of Lender, the Consultant and the Architect,
make or permit any change in the Plans and Specifications.

compliance with all Applicable Laws governing the construction,
development, use and operation of the Project and the development,
operation and sale of the Units. Evidence of such compliance shall be

designees


26
<PAGE>

access to and the right to inspect, audit and copy all books, records,
contracts and other documents and information relating to Borrower or
the Property. Lender shall use reasonable efforts to keep confidential
all information and documentation obtained by Lender in connection with
such audits and inspections, except to the extent that Lender
determines, in its reasonable discretion, a need to disclose same;
provided, however, under no circumstances shall Lender have any
liability to Borrower in the event of an unintentional disclosure or
disclosure deemed necessary by Lender. All such books, records and
accounts of operations relating to the Property shall be kept in
accordance with sound accounting practices consistently applied.
Borrower shall promptly respond to any inquiry from Lender for
information with respect to the Property, which information may be
verified by Lender at Borrower's expense; provided, however, that
Lender shall at all times be entitled to rely upon any statements or
representations made by Borrower or any agent thereof.

7.6 Mechanics' Liens. Borrower shall not permit any mechanics'
lien claims to be filed or otherwise asserted against the Project or
against any funds due any contractor or subcontractor, and Borrower
shall promptly (and in any event within fifteen days after Borrower has
received notice of such filing) discharge or cause to be discharged the
same in case of the filing of any claims for lien or proceedings for
the enforcement thereof; provided that in connection with any such lien
or claim which Borrower may in good faith desire to contest, Borrower
may contest the same by appropriate legal proceedings diligently
prosecuted, but only if Borrower shall furnish to the Title Company
such security or indemnity as the Title Company requires to induce the
Title Company to issue an endorsement to the Title Policy insuring over
the exception created by such lien, and provided further, that Lender
shall not be required to make any further disbursements of the
Construction Loan until any mechanics' lien claims have been so insured
against by the Title Company.

7.7 Release by Lender. With respect to the matters set forth
in Section 7.6 above, if Borrower shall (a) fail promptly to discharge
any asserted liens or claims, or (b) fail promptly to contest asserted
liens or claims or to give security or indemnity in the manner provided
in Section 7.6 above, or (c) having commenced to contest the same, and
having given such security or indemnity, fail to prosecute such contest
with diligence, or to maintain such indemnity or security so required
by the Title Company for its full amount, or (d) upon adverse
conclusion of any such contest, fail promptly to cause any judgment or
decree to be satisfied and lien to be released, then Lender may, but
shall not be required to, procure the release and discharge of any such
claim and any judgment or decree thereon and, further, may, in its sole
discretion, effect any settlement or compromise of the same, or may
furnish such security or indemnity to the Title Company, and any
amounts so expended by Lender, including premiums paid or security
furnished in connection with the issuance of any surety company bonds,
shall be deemed to constitute disbursements of the proceeds of the
Loans hereunder and shall bear interest from the date so disbursed
until paid at the Default Rate. In settling, compromising or
discharging any claims for lien, Lender shall not be required to
inquire into the validity or amount of any such claim.


27

7.8 Financial Statements; Reports. Borrower shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to Lender each month, a detailed report showing
the progress of the Work, the number of reservation deposits for Units
made, if any, and the number of sales contracts for Units entered into
by Borrower during the immediately preceding month, if any, and the
status of all reservation deposits and sales contracts entered into
prior thereto, if any. In addition to such progress reports and any
other financial statements required to be delivered to Lender pursuant
to the provisions of any of the other Loan Documents, Borrower will

7.11 Proceedings Affecting Property. If any proceedings are
filed seeking to enjoin or otherwise prevent or declare invalid or
unlawful the construction, occupancy, use, maintenance or operation of
the Project, or any portion thereof, Borrower shall cause such
proceedings to be vigorously contested in good faith, and in the event
of an adverse ruling or decision, prosecute all allowable appeals
therefrom, and shall, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
resist the entry or seek the stay of any temporary or permanent
injunction that may be entered, and use its best efforts to bring about
a favorable and speedy disposition of all such proceedings. All such
proceedings, including without limitation, all of Lender's costs, and
fees and disbursements of Lender's counsel in connection with any such
proceedings, whether or not Lender is a party thereto, shall be at
Borrower's expense. To the extent that Lender incurs any such expenses,
including attorneys' fees and fees and charges for court costs, bonds
and the like, Borrower shall reimburse Lender for such expenses and the
amount due Lender shall bear interest from the date so incurred by
Lender until repaid to Lender at the Default Rate and shall be payable
to Lender on demand.

7.12 Disposal and Encumbrance of Property. Except as expressly
permitted pursuant to Article 12 below, Borrower shall not, without
Lender's prior written consent, suffer, permit or enter into any
agreement for any sale, lease, transfer, or in any way encumber or
dispose of or grant or suffer any security or other assignment
(collateral or otherwise) of or in all or any portion of the Project.
Any consent given by Lender or any waiver of default under this
Section, shall not constitute a consent to, or waiver of any right,
remedy or power of Lender under any subsequent default hereunder.

7.13 Insurance. Borrower shall pay all premiums on all
insurance policies required from time to time under this Agreement, and
thirty days prior to expiration of any such policies, Borrower shall
furnish to Lender, with premiums prepaid, additional and renewal
policies in form, and with companies, coverage, deductibles and amounts
satisfactory to Lender. In the event of failure by Borrower to provide
such insurance, Lender may, but shall not be required to, place
insurance and treat the amounts expended therefor as disbursements of
Loans proceeds and such amounts from the date so expended by Lender
until repaid to Lender shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

7.14 Performance of Obligations; Notice of Default. Borrower
shall promptly and fully perform and comply in all respects with the
obligations, terms, agreements, provisions and requirements of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and all other documents and
instruments relating thereto and will not permit to occur any default
or breach hereunder or thereunder. Borrower shall promptly give to
Lender notice of the occurrence of any Unmatured Default or of any
event that could have a material adverse effect on any security for the
Loans or on Borrower's ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

not occur: (i) any amendment or modification of the Borrower's
operating agreement or the certificate of formation of Borrower, (ii)
the admission of any new members to Borrower. At all times prior to the
repayment of the Loans, (A) the Member shall be the sole member of
Borrower; (B) Borrower shall not make or permit any distributions of
cash flow or cash proceeds to Member or any partner, subpartner,
member, shareholder, officer, director or affiliate of Borrower or
Member and all positive cash flow from the Project shall be paid to
Lender and applied to the repayment of the Principal Balance; (C)
Borrower shall not enter into any contract or agreement for the
provision of services or otherwise with respect to the Project with any
partner, subpartner, member, shareholder, officer, director or
affiliate of any partner of Borrower or Member unless such contract or
agreement is an arms-length, market rate agreement and is cancelable
upon thirty days written notice from any owner of the Project; and (D)
neither Borrower nor Member shall be dissolved or its existence
terminated; provided, however, as long as the Letter of Credit is
surrendered to Lender and not drawn upon, Borrower shall be able to
make distributions of cash flow or cash proceeds to Member as a result
of sales of the condominiums in the Tower Residence Building located at
333 N. Des Plaines Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60661.

7.17 Use of Receipts. Borrower shall cause all rents and other
income and receipts realized and received by Borrower, if any, from and
in connection with the Project to be used for the purpose of paying the
actual costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in connection with the
ownership, operation, management and repair of the Project, including
without limitation, operating expenses, real estate taxes, insurance
premiums and interest on the Loans. Borrower shall cause all sale
proceeds and other income and receipts realized and received by

7.18 Budget. Borrower shall not make any changes in the
expenses contained in the Budget without the prior written consent of
Lender. Borrower shall not be entitled to reallocate among line items
in the Budget without the prior written consent of Lender, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld if Borrower has (i) proposed
the reduction of a line item and the reallocation of the amount of such
reduction to other line items in the Budget, and (ii) provided Lender
with satisfactory evidence that the reduction of a line item is
appropriate and reasonable because the amount originally set forth with
respect thereto will not be required to complete said item.

7.19 Management and Leasing Agreements; Subordination.
Borrower shall not amend, extend, substitute or enter into any new
management or leasing agreement covering all or any portion of the
Project without Lender's prior written consent. In the event that

acceptable in form and substance to Lender, pursuant to which said
manager or broker subordinates its liens for unpaid fees to the liens
of the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.

record any document pertaining to, affecting or running with all or any
portion of the Property, including, without limitation, any condominium

unreasonably withheld. Upon granting such approval, Lender agrees to
execute such consents and subordination agreements with respect to such
condominium documents as are acceptable to Lender in its reasonable
discretion.

7.21 Sale to Investors. Without the prior written consent of
Lender, which consent may be granted or denied at Lender's sole
discretion, Borrower shall not knowingly sell multiple Unit Interests
to investors or syndicators who are acquiring such Unit Interests with
the intent to resell them.

Lender, and in any event at least thirty (30) days prior to the sale of
the first Unit Interest, Borrower shall take all necessary actions and
execute, deliver, record (except recording of such documents shall not
take place until immediately prior to such first sale) and file all
necessary documents and instruments (including, without limitation, the
condominium plats for the residential condominiums constituting part of
the Project) to cause the Property to be submitted and made subject to
the provisions of the Condominium Laws and to comply with all other
legal requirements relating to the development of the Property as a
condominium project; provided, however, that Borrower shall not take
any such action or execute, deliver, record or file any such documents
or instruments without first (a) providing Lender with written notice
of such actions and copies of such documents and instruments and (b)
obtaining Lender's written consent thereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Borrower shall not terminate, amend or otherwise
modify any of the Condominium Documents without Lender's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Upon
recordation of the plat of condominium, the condominium declaration and
the other Condominium Documents required to be recorded, Borrower shall
cause the Title Company to add to the Title Policy a Condominium
Endorsement (No. 4) in form and substance acceptable to Lender. At all
times after such recordation, Borrower shall, to the extent permitted
by the Condominium Laws and the Condominium Documents, take all actions
in its capacity as developer, declarant, manager, unit owner and
otherwise to cause the Property (including, without limitation, all
common elements) to (i) be insured, (ii) remain free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances except the Permitted Exceptions and any other
exceptions hereafter approved by Lender in writing, and (iii) be
operated in accordance with all of the requirements of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents.

encroachments by the improvements over easements or adjoining property.
Within thirty days subsequent to the completion of the exterior walls
and roof of the Building and as a condition to any

the Building "as built" and to show the location of all utilities and
any additional easements or other matters of record affecting the
Project.

7.24 Borrower's Accounts.  Borrower shall maintain the
operating, earnest money and reserve accounts for the Property with
Lender and pledge the operating and reserve accounts to Lender as
security for the Loans.

7.25 Ineligible Securities. Borrower represents and warrants
that no portion of any advance or loan made hereunder shall be used
directly or indirectly to purchase ineligible securities, as defined by
applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, underwritten by
any affiliate of Banc One Corporation during the underwriting period
and for thirty (30) days thereafter.

8. LOAN EXPENSES. Borrower agrees to pay all of the Loan Expenses. Any
Loan Expenses paid by Lender shall bear interest commencing on the date demand
for repayment thereof is made by Lender until repaid to Lender at the Default
Rate and shall be paid by Borrower upon demand, or may be paid by Lender at any
time by disbursement of proceeds of the Loans. Any Loan Expenses paid by Lender
shall be reimbursed to Lender by Borrower regardless of whether there shall be
any disbursements of the Loans.

9. LENDER'S REPRESENTATIVES. Lender, at Borrower's expense, shall have
the right to engage personnel in connection with negotiation, documentation,
administration and servicing of the Construction Loan, including without
limitation, the Consultant, to (i) review and approve the Plans and
Specifications, (ii) review and approve Borrower's final construction budget,

Specifications, and (ix) provide other services as requested by Lender, and
Borrower shall fully cooperate with the Consultant and other personnel in all
reasonable respects in connection therewith.

10. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  The occurrence of any one or more of the
following shall constitute an "Event of Default":

(a) Failure by Borrower or any other obligor to pay on or
before the fifth day following the date when due any installment of
principal or interest or any other amount payable pursuant to the
Notes, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

(b) Failure by Borrower to promptly perform or cause to be
performed any non-monetary obligation or observe any non-monetary
condition, covenant, term, agreement or provision required to be
performed or observed by Borrower or any other obligor under this
Agreement, the Notes, the Mortgage, the Indemnity Agreement or any


32
<PAGE>

of the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that if such failure by
its nature can be cured, then so long as the continued operation and
safety of the Project, and the priority, validity and enforceability of
the lien created by the Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents and
the value of the Project are not imminently impaired, threatened or
jeopardized, then Borrower shall have a period (the "Cure Period") of
thirty days after written notice from Lender of any such failure of
performance or observance to cure or cause the cure of the same, and an
Event of Default shall not be deemed to exist during the Cure Period,
provided further that if Borrower commences to cure such failure during
the Cure Period and is diligently and in good faith attempting to
effect such cure, the Cure Period shall be extended until such failure
is cured, but in no event shall the Cure Period be longer than 90 days
in the aggregate. The foregoing Cure Period is intended only to apply
in circumstances not referred to in any of the other paragraphs of this
Section; Borrower's right to a grace or cure period, if any, with
respect to such other circumstances are to be governed by the
provisions of such other paragraphs.

(c) The existence of any material inaccuracy or untruth in any
representation, or warranty contained in this Agreement or any other
Loan Documents, or of any statement or certification as to facts
delivered to Lender by or on behalf of Borrower.

(d) A discontinuance of the construction of the Work for a
period of fifteen consecutive days (unless otherwise approved by
Lender), other than a discontinuance resulting from strikes, acts of
God, adverse weather conditions or other occurrences beyond the
reasonable control of Borrower (it being understood that a delay caused
by an insufficiency of funds shall not be deemed to be beyond the
control of Borrower), or any delay in the Work, regardless of cause,
the result of which may be, in Lender's sole judgment, that the Work
will not be substantially completed prior to July 31, 2000.

(e) At any time Borrower, Member or Heartland files a
voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or is adjudicated a bankrupt or
insolvent, or institutes (by petition, application, answer, consent or
otherwise) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,
composition, readjustment, dissolution, liquidation or similar
proceedings under any present or future federal, state or other statute
or law, or admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they
mature, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or
seeks or consents to the appointment of any receiver, trustee or
similar officer for all or any substantial part of its property.

(f) The commencement of any involuntary petition in bankruptcy
against Borrower, Member or Heartland or the institution against
Borrower, Member or Heartland of any reorganization, arrangement,
composition, readjustment, dissolution, liquidation or similar

have the right to contest by appropriate proceedings the validity of
such order if and only if Borrower shall, within thirty days after
Lender's demand aforesaid, (i) places a bond with Lender in an amount,

11. REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender, in
addition to availing itself of any remedies conferred upon it at law or in
equity and by the terms of the Notes, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents,
may pursue any one or more of the following remedies first, concurrently or
successively with each other and with any other available remedies, it being the
intent hereof that none of such remedies shall be to the exclusion of any
others:

(a) Take possession of the Project and complete the Work and
do anything necessary or desirable in Lender's sole judgment to fulfill
the obligations of Borrower hereunder, including either the right to
avail itself of and procure performance of the Construction Contract,
any Subcontracts or any other contract entered into for the performance
of all or any portion of the Work (or any substitute therefor), or to
let new or additional contracts with the same contractors or
subcontractors or others, and to employ watchmen to protect the Project
from injury. Without restricting the generality of the foregoing and
for the purposes aforesaid, Borrower hereby appoints and constitutes
Lender its lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution (i)
to complete the Work in the name of Borrower; (ii) to use portions of
the Construction Loan or other funds which may be reserved, escrowed or
set aside for any purposes hereunder at any time to complete the Work;
(iii) to make changes in the Plans and Specifications which shall be
reasonably necessary or reasonably desirable to complete the Work; (iv)
to retain or employ new general contractors, subcontractors,
architects, engineers and inspectors as shall be required for such
purposes; (v) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and
claims, which may be liens or security interests or to avoid such bills
and claims becoming liens or security interests against the Project, or
as may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the Work or for
the clearance of title; (vi) to execute all applications and
certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any of
the Loan Documents; (vii) to prosecute and defend all actions or
proceedings in connection with the Work; (viii) to take such action and
require such performance as it deems necessary under any of the bonds
to be furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof and to make
settlements and compromises with the surety or sureties thereunder, and
in connection therewith, to execute instruments of release and
satisfaction; it being understood that the foregoing power of attorney
is coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. All sums expended by
Lender pursuant to this Article 11 shall be deemed to have been paid to
Borrower and secured by the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, and
shall bear interest at the Default Rate until repaid to Lender.

(b) Withhold further disbursements of proceeds of the
Construction Loan.

(c) Declare the unpaid indebtedness evidenced by the Notes to
be immediately due and payable.

(d) Excluding any earnest money deposits, apply the balance of
any deposits made with Lender toward the repayment of the Loans.

12.      SALES OF UNIT INTERESTS; PARTIAL RELEASES.


35
<PAGE>

12.1 Right to Sell. Borrower shall have the right to enter
into and perform sales contracts with creditworthy third party
purchasers of the Unit Interests on the form contract submitted to and
approved in writing by Lender, provided that (i) no Event of Default
then exists, (ii) the gross sales price for the Unit Interest being
sold is not less than the minimum sales price therefor contained in
Exhibit E attached hereto, and (iii) the earnest money under said
contract is being held by Lender. Borrower shall deliver to Lender a
copy of each fully signed contract within five (5) days after the full
execution and delivery thereof.

12.2 Release of Liens. Provided that all of the conditions
described in Section 12.1 above have been satisfied in form and
substance acceptable to Lender and no Event of Default then exists,
Lender will issue a partial release of lien of its Loan Documents
covering any Unit Interest upon the payment to Lender of an amount
equal to 100% of the Net Sales Proceeds payable to Borrower with
respect to the sale thereof.

13.      MISCELLANEOUS.

13.1 Additional Indebtedness. If any advances or payments made
by Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
together with disbursements of the Loans, shall exceed the aggregate
face amount of the Notes, all such advances and payments shall
constitute additional indebtedness secured by the Mortgage and all
other security for the Loans, and shall bear interest at the Default
Rate from the date advanced until paid.

13.2 Additional Acts. Borrower shall, upon request, execute
and deliver such further instruments and documents and do such further
acts and things as may be reasonably required to provide to Lender the
evidence of and security for the Loans contemplated by this Agreement.

13.3 Loan Agreement Governs. In the event of any inconsistency
between any provision of this Agreement and any provision of any other
Loan Document, the provision of this Agreement shall govern; provided,
however, that the provisions of all of the Loan Documents shall be
construed as an integrated set of provisions governing the Loans and,
accordingly, shall be interpreted and construed liberally to give the
maximum validity, enforceability and effect to all of such provisions.

13.4 Additional Advances. If an Event of Default shall occur,
Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, take any and all actions to
cure such default, and all amounts expended in so doing, all Loan
Expenses and all other amounts paid or advanced by Lender pursuant to
the Loan Documents, and all other amounts advanced by Lender in
connection with the performance of the Work or preserving any security
for the Loans, shall constitute additional advances of the Construction
Loan, shall be secured by the Mortgage and all other security for the
Loans, and shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date
advanced until paid.

13.5 Amendment; Waiver; Approval. This Agreement shall not be
amended, modified or supplemented without the written agreement of
Borrower and Lender at the time of such amendment, modification or
supplement. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents shall be effective unless set forth in writing
signed by the party making such waiver, and any such waiver shall be
effective only to the extent therein set forth. Failure by Lender to
insist upon full and prompt performance of any provisions of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or to take action in the
event of any breach of any such provision or upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default, shall not constitute a waiver of any rights of
Lender, and Lender may at any time thereafter exercise all available
rights and remedies with respect to such breach or Event of Default.
Receipt by Lender of any instrument or document shall not constitute or
be deemed to be an approval thereof. Any approvals required under any
of the other Loan Documents must be in writing, signed by Lender and
directed to Borrower.

13.6 Notice. All notices, communications and waivers under
this Loan Agreement shall be in writing and shall be (i) delivered in

or sale of any limited partnership interest or membership interest in
Borrower, the acquisition or sale or offer for sale of all or any
portion of the Property (including Unit Interests) and/or the
ownership, use, operation or maintenance of the Property, including,
without limitation, (a) any brokerage commissions or finder's fees
asserted against Lender with respect to the making of the Loans, the
acquisition of the Property or the sale of Unit Interests and (b)
claims by purchasers of Unit Interests with respect to defects in the
Property or other matters; provided, however, that the foregoing
indemnity shall not extend to any liabilities, obligations, claims,
losses, costs, damages or expenses resulting from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of Lender.

performance and observance by Borrower of each covenant, agreement,
provision and term of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

13.13 Invalid Provisions. In the event that any provision of
this Agreement is deemed to be invalid by reason of the operation of

Agreement and the validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions, or portions or applications thereof, shall not be affected
thereby and shall remain in full force and effect.

of Lender hereunder or provided by law, any indebtedness relating to

with Lender) may be offset and applied by Lender hereunder, or under
the Notes, the Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents.

13.15 Acts by Lender. Notwithstanding anything herein

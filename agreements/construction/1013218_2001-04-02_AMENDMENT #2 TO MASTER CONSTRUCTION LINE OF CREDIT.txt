provided for in section 4 hereof, section 2.9 (a) of the Credit Agreement is
amended to read in its entirety as follows:

(A) INTEREST ON PRIME RATE LOANS. During any period in which a
Loan is a Prime Rate Loan, the unpaid principal amount of such Loan
shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum which shall at all
times be equal to the Prime Rate in effect from time to time, PROVIDED
that during the Construction Period for such Project at all times prior
to June 1, 2000, an interest rate margin of 25 basis points shall be
added to such Prime Rate, and at all times on or after June 1, 2000, an
interest rate margin of 50 basis points shall be added to such Prime
Rate, PROVIDED FURTHER that during the Mini-Perm Period for such

Amendment provided for in section 4 hereof, section 9.6 of the Credit Agreement
is amended by adding the following text at the end of such section:

If the Borrower fails to satisfy the ratio set forth above for any
period then such failure shall not constitute an Event of Default
pursuant to section 10.1(c), if (i) within forty-five days of the end
of the relevant period, the Borrower prepays the Loans for such Project
in an amount such that when the assumed level debt service obligations
(consisting of both principal and interest) for such Project for such
period and on a going-forward basis, based upon the weighted average
aggregate principal amount of the Loans for such Project, as adjusted
in accordance with the amount of principal prepaid, the DSCR for such
Project for such period will meet or exceed the ratio set forth above,
(ii) the Borrower provides to the Administrative Agent a calculation of
the DSCR for such period including therein the effect of such
prepayment, and (iii) the Administrative Agent confirms its receipt of

Contractor shall before moving the load on to such highway
or bridge give notice to the Engineer or Engineer's
Representative of the weight and other particulars of the

may reject such Plant and shall notify the Contractor in
writing thereof immediately.  The notice shall state the
Engineer's objections with reasons.  The Engineer shall not
reject any Plant for minor defects which do not affect the
commercial operation of the Plant.

The Contractor shall within reasonable time make good the
defect or ensure that any rejected Plant complies with the
Contract.

If the Engineer requires such Plant to be retested, the tests
shall be repeated under the same terms and conditions.  All
costs incurred by the Employer and certified by the Engineer as
the result of the repetition of the tests shall be deducted
from the Contract Price.

8.7   Removal of Improper Plant
The Engineer shall have authority to issue instructions from
time to time, for:

a)   the removal from the Site, within such time or times as
may be specified in the instruction, of any materials or
Plant which, in the opinion of the Engineer, are not in
accordance with the Contract,

b)   the substitution of proper and suitable materials or
Plant, and

c)   the removal and proper re-execution, notwithstanding any
previous test thereof or interim payment therefor, of any
work which, in respect of:

(i)  materials, Plant or workmanship, or
(ii) design by the Contractor or for which he is
responsible, is not, in the opinion of the Engineer,
in accordance with the Contract.

8.8   Default of Contractor in Compliance
In case of default on the part of the Contractor in carrying
out such instruction within the time specified therein or, if
none, within a reasonable time, the Employer shall be entitled
to employ and


1-33
<PAGE>   54
pay other persons to carry out the same and all costs
consequent thereon or incidental thereto shall, after due
consultation with the Employer and the Contractor, be
determined by the Engineer and shall be recoverable from the
Contractor by the Employer, and may be deducted by the Employer
from any moneys due or become due to the Contractor and the
Engineer shall notify the Contractor accordingly, with a copy
to the Employer.

8.9   Examination of Work Before Covering Up
No part of the Works shall be covered up or put out of view
without the approval of the Engineer and the Contractor shall
afford full opportunity for the Engineer to examine and measure
any such part of the Works which is about to be covered up or
put out of view and to examine foundations before any part of
the Works is placed thereon.  The Contractor shall give due
notice to the Engineer whenever any such assembly, work or
foundation is or are ready or about to be ready for examination
and the Engineer shall, without unreasonable delay, unless he
considers it unnecessary and advises the Contractor
accordingly, attend for the purpose of examining and measuring
such assembly or work or of examining such foundations.

8.10  Uncovering & Making Openings
The Contractor shall uncover any part of the Works or make
openings in or through the same as the Engineer may from time
to time direct and shall reinstate and make good such part to
the satisfaction of the Engineer.  If any such part has been
covered up or put out of view after compliance with the
requirement of the preceding Sub-Clause and is found to be
executed in accordance with the Contract, the Engineer shall,
after due consultation with the Employer and the Contractor,
determine the amount of the Contractor's costs in respect of
such of uncovering, making openings in or through, reinstating
and making good the same, which shall be added to the Contract
Price, and shall notify the Contractor accordingly, with a copy
to the Employer.  In any other case all costs shall be borne by
the Contractor.

8.11  Plant - Free Issue
Where the Employer is providing without charge to the
Contractor (Free Issue) Plant for incorporation in the Works,
such Plant shall remain the property of the Employer.  The
Contractor shall maintain such plant in good order and
condition and shall


1-34
<PAGE>   55
take full responsibility for the care thereof.  Waste or loss
of such Plant arising from bad workmanship or from the neglect
of the Contractor shall be made good at the expense of the
Contractor.

8.12  Permission to Deliver
The Contractor shall apply in writing to the Engineer for
permission to deliver any Plant or Contractor's Equipment to
the Site.  No Plant or Contractor's Equipment may be delivered
to the Site without the Engineer's written permission.
Authorization for shipment under Annex C is deemed as
permission to deliver such Plant and Equipment.

The Contractor shall be responsible for the reception on Site
of the Plant and Contractor's Equipment.

8.13  Warranty
a)   The Contractor warrants that the Plant supplied under the
Contract are in accordance with the specification, new,
unused, of the most recent or current models and
incorporate all recent improvements in design and
materials.  The Contractor further warrants that all Plant
supplied under this Contract shall have no defect arising
from design, materials or workmanship or from any act or
omission of the Contractor that may develop under normal
use of the supplied Plant in the conditions prevailing at
the site of Finchaa Sugar Factor.

b)   This Warranty shall remain valid for 12 months after
Taking-over Certificate is issued for the Plant or, any
portion thereof as the case may be.

c)   The Employer shall promptly notify the Contractor in
writing of any claims arising under this Warranty.

d)   Upon receipt of such notice the Contractor shall, with all
reasonable speed, repair or replace the defective plant or
parts thereof, without costs to the Employer.





1-35
<PAGE>   56
e)   If the Contractor, having been notified, fails to remedy
the defect(s) within a reasonable period, the Employer may
proceed to take such remedial action as may be necessary,
at the Contractor's risk and expense and without prejudice
to any other rights which the Employer may have against
the Contractor under the Contract.

9.                      SUSPENSION OF WORKS, DELIVERY
OR ERECTION

9.1   Order to Suspend
The Engineer may at any time instruct the Contractor to:

a)   suspend progress of the Works, or

b)   suspend delivery of Plant or Contractor's Equipment which
is ready for delivery to the Site at the time for delivery
specified in the Master Schedule, or if no time is
specified, at the time appropriate for it to be delivered,
or

c)   suspend the erection of Plant which has been delivered to
the Site.

When the Contractor is prevented from delivering or erecting
Plant in accordance the Master Schedule the Engineer shall be
deemed to have instructed a suspension except when such
prevention is caused by the Contractor's default.

The Contractor shall during suspension protect and secure the
Works or Plant affected at the Contractor's works or elsewhere
or at the Site, as the case may be, against any deterioration,
loss or damage.

9.2   Cost of Suspension
The additional cost incurred by the Contractor in protecting,
securing and insuring the Works or Plant and in following the
Engineer's instructions under Sub-Clause 9.1 and in resumption
of the work, shall be added to the Contract Price.

9.3   Payment in Event of Suspension
The Contractor shall be entitled to payment for Plant which has
not been delivered to Site if the work on Plant or delivery of
Plant has been suspended for more than 30 days.  After 30 days
of





1-36
<PAGE>   57
suspension, the Contractor shall be entitled to payment of the
value of such Plant as at the date of suspension.

A certificate of payment shall be issued on condition that:

a)   the Contractor has marked the Plant as the Employer's
property in accordance with the Engineer's instructions,
and

b)   the suspension is not due to the Contractor's default.

9.4   Prolonged Suspension
If suspension of the Works under Sub-Clause 9.1 has continued
for more than 90 days, and the suspension is not due to the
Contractor's default, the Contractor may by notice to the
Engineer require permission to proceed within 30 days.

If permission is not granted within that time, the Contractor
may treat the suspension as an omission under Clause 16 of the
Section it affects, or if the suspension affects the whole of
the Works, terminate the Contract and the provisions of Clause
27 shall apply.

9.5   Resumption of Work
If the Contractor chooses not to treat prolonged suspension as
an omission or termination under Sub-Clause 9.4, the Employer
shall upon the request of the Contractor, take over the
responsibility for protection, storage, security and insurance
of the suspended Works and the risk of loss or damage thereto
shall thereupon pass to the Employer.

After receipt of permission or an order to proceed, the
Contractor shall, after due notice to the Engineer, examine the
Works and the Plant affected by the suspension.  The Contractor
shall make good any deterioration or defect in or loss of the
Works or Plant that may have occurred during the suspension.
The cost properly incurred by the Contractor which would not
have been incurred but for the suspension shall be added to the
Contract Price.


1-37
<PAGE>   58
The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment for costs
incurred in making good any deterioration, defect or loss
caused by faulty workmanship or materials or by the
Contractor's failure to take the measures specified in
Sub-Clause 9.1.

If the Employer has taken over risk and responsibility for the
suspended Works under this Sub-Clause, risk and responsibility
shall revert to the Contractor 14 days after receipt of the
permission or order to proceed.

10.                 COMMENCEMENT AND COMPLETION OF WORKS

10.1  Commencement of Works
The Contractor shall commence the Works on the Effective Date.
Thereafter, the Contractor shall proceed with the Works with
due expedition and without delay.

10.2  Time for Completion
The Works shall be completed and shall have passed the Tests on
Completion within 28 months from the Commencement Date as
extended, to the extent necessary, pursuant to Sub-Clause 10.3.

10.3  Extension of Time for Completion
The Contractor may claim an extension of the Time for
Completion if he is or will be delayed in completing the Works
by any of the following causes:

a)   extra or additional work ordered in writing under Clause
16,
b)   exceptional adverse weather conditions,
c)   physical obstructions or conditions which could not
reasonably have been foreseen by the Contractor,
d)   Employer's or Engineer's instructions, otherwise than by
reason of the Contractor's default,
e)   the failure of the Employer to fulfill any of his
obligations under the Contract,
f)   delay by any other contractor engaged by the Employer,
g)   any suspension of the Works under Clause 9, except when
due to the Contractor's default,
h)   any industrial dispute,
i)   the Employer's Risks,
j)   Force Majeure,





1-38
<PAGE>   59
k)   any impediment or prevention by the Employer not already
mentioned in Sub-Clause 10.3,
l)   Any delay resulting from loss, destruction or theft of
plant/equipment and/or Contractor's plant/equipment, from
time of shipment to time of arrival at Site and while
stored at site, such theft or pilferage being the subject
of an insurance claim.

The Contractor shall give to the Engineer notice of this
intention to make a claim for an extension of time within 14
days of the circumstances for such a claim becoming known to
the Contractor.  The notice shall be followed as soon as
possible by the claim with full supporting details.

The Engineer shall, after due consultation with the Employer
and the Contractor, grant the Contractor from time to time,
either prospectively or retrospectively, such extension of Time
for Completion as may be justified.  The Engineer shall notify
the Employer and the Contractor accordingly.

The Contractor shall be entitled to such extension whether the
delay occurs before or after the Time for Completion.

Where an extension of time has been granted under Sub-Clause
10.3, the additional cost of maintaining the Performance
Security in place must be borne by the Employer, and the period
and value of Performance Security for such extended time must
be subject to mutual agreement between the Employer and
Contractor.

10.4  Rate of Progress
If for any reason, which does not entitle the Contractor to an
extension of time, the rate of progress of the Works or any
Section is at any time, in the opinion of the Engineer, too
slow to comply with the Time for Completion, the Engineer shall
so notify the Contractor who shall thereupon take such steps as
are necessary, subject to the consent of the Engineer, to
expedite progress so as to comply with the Time for Completion.
The Contractor shall not be entitled to any additional payment
for taking such steps.  If, as a result of any notice given by
the Engineer under this Clause,





1-39
<PAGE>   60
the Contractor considers that it is necessary to do any work at
night or on locally recognized holiday or days of rest, he
shall be entitled to seek the consent of the Engineer (of which
consent cannot be unreasonably refused) so to do.

Provided that if any steps, taken by the Contractor in meeting
his obligations under this Clause, involve the Employer in
additional supervision costs, such costs shall, after due
consultation with the Employer and the Contractor, be
determined by the Engineer and shall be recoverable from the
Contractor by the Employer, and may be deducted by the Employer
from any monies due or to become due to the Contractor and the
Engineer shall notify the Contractor accordingly, with a copy
to the Employer.

10.5  Delay in Completion and Liquidated Damages
If the Contractor fails to complete the Works within the Time
for Completion, the Employer shall be entitled to a reduction
in the Contract Price as Liquidated Damages.

The reduction shall be 0.07% (seven hundredths of one percent)
per day of the Contract Price which is attributable to such
part of the works as cannot in consequence of the failure be
put to the intended use.  The reduction shall be computed for
each day between the Time for Completion and the actual date of
completion.

If, before the completion of the whole of the works any part or
section of the Works has been certified by the Engineer as
completed and occupied or used by the Employer, the liquidated
damages for delay shall, for any period of delay after such
certificate and in the absence of alternative provisions in the
Contract be reduced in the proportion which the value of the
part or section so certified bears to the value of the whole of
the works.

The reduction shall in no case exceed five (5) percent of the
Contract Price.

Except as provided in Sub-Clause 10.7, such reduction shall be
to the exclusion of any other remedy of the Employer in respect
of the Contractor's failure to complete within the Time for
Completion.





1-40
<PAGE>   61
10.6  Bonus for Early Completion
If the Contractor completes the Works in less time than that
established in the Time for Completion, the Contractor shall be
entitled to a bonus as specified in Annex E.

10.7  Prolonged Delay
If the Employer has become entitled to the maximum reduction
under Sub-Clause 10.5 for any part of the Works, he may by
notice require the Contractor to complete.  Such notice shall
fix a final time for completion which shall be reasonable.

If the Contractor fails to complete within such time, and this
is not due to a cause for which the Employer or some other
contractor employed by the Employer is responsible, the
Employer may by further notice to the Contractor either:

a)   require the Contractor to complete, or
b)   may himself complete at the Contractor's cost provided
that he does so in a reasonable manner, or
c)   terminate the Contract.

If the Employer terminates the Contract, he shall be entitled
to recover from the Contractor any loss he has suffered up to
the maximum amount stated in the Contract.  If no maximum
amount is stated, the Employer shall not be entitled to recover
more than that part of the Contract Price which is attributable
to that part of the Works which cannot by reason of the
Contractor's failure be put to the intended use.

The Employer shall give credit for the value of any part of the
Works which he retains.

11.                          TESTS ON COMPLETION

11.1  Notice of Tests
The Contractor shall give to the Engineer 21 days' notice of the
date after which he will be ready to make the Tests on
Completion.  Unless otherwise agreed, the Tests shall take
place within 10 days after the said date on such day or days as
the Engineer shall notify the Contractor.

11.2  Time for Tests
If the Engineer fails to appoint a time within 21  days after
having been asked to do so, or does not attend at the time and
place appointed, the


1-41
<PAGE>   62
Contractor shall be entitled to proceed with the Tests in his
absence.  The Tests shall then be deemed to have been made in
the presence of the Engineer and the results  of the Tests
shall be accepted as accurate.

11.3  Delayed Tests
If the Tests are being unduly delayed by the Contractor the
Engineer may by notice require the Contractor to make the Tests
within 10 days after the receipt of such notice.  The
Contractor shall make the Tests on such days within that period
as the Contractor may fix and of which he shall give notice to
the Engineer.

If the Contractor fails to make the Tests within 10 days the
Engineer may himself proceed with the Tests.  All Tests so made
by the Engineer shall be at the risk and cost of the Contractor
and the cost thereof shall be deducted from the Contract Price.
The Tests shall then be deemed to have been made in the
presence of the Contractor and the results of the Tests shall
be accepted as accurate.

11.4  Facilities for Tests on Completion
The Employer shall provide free of charge  such labor,
materials, electricity, fuel, water, stores, apparatus and
other things as may be reasonably required by the Contractor to
carry out the Tests.

11.5  Notice of Test Results
The Engineer must give the Contractor written notice of the
Engineer's  interpretation of the results of each Test within
15 days of the test date.  If the Employer fails to provide
such written notice to the Contractor within the time
specified, the Plant should be deemed to have passed the Test.

11.6  Retesting
If the Work or any Section fails to pass the Tests, the
Engineer or the Contractor may require such Tests to be
repeated within a reasonable time on the same terms and
conditions.  All costs to which the Employer may be put by the
repetition of the Tests under this Sub-Clause shall be deducted
from the Contract Price.





1-42
<PAGE>   63
11.7  Disagreement as to Result of Tests
If the Engineer and the Contractor disagree on the
interpretation of the Test results, each shall give a statement
of his views to the other within 14 days after such
disagreement arises.  The statement shall be accompanied by all
relevant evidence.

11.8  Consequences of Failure to Pass Tests on Completion
If the works or any Section fails to pass the Tests on the
repetition thereof under Sub-Clause 11.6, the Engineer, after
due consultation with the Employer and the Contractor, shall
allow the Contractor if he desires to conduct a third test
within seven days after the Contractor has received notice that
such plant failed the second test and if the plant then fails
Test or Contractor elects not to re-test for the third time,
the Engineer shall:

a)   Reject the Works or Section in which event the Employer
shall have the same remedies against the Contractor as are
provided under Sub-Clause 15.5(a) or

b)   Issue a Taking-Over Certificate, if the Employer so
wishes, notwithstanding that the Works are not complete.
The Contract Price shall then be reduced by such amount as
may be agreed by the Employer and the Contractor or,
failing agreement, as may be determined by arbitration.

11.9  Test Certificate
As soon as the Works or any Section thereof has passed the
Tests, the Engineer shall issue a Certificate to the Contractor
and the Employer to that effect.





1-43
<PAGE>   64
11.10 Test by Employer's Operators
Before issuing of the Taking-Over Certificate, the Employer's
operators shall run the Plant with materials under the
direction and supervision of the Contractor.

12.                              TAKING OVER

12.1  Taking Over
The Works or any Section thereof specified under Annex 11.7(c)
shall be taken over by the Employer when they have been
substantially completed in accordance with the Contract, except
in minor respects that do not affect the use of the works for
their intended purpose, have passed the Tests on Completion
prescribed by the Contract and a Taking-Over Certificate has
been issued or deemed to have been issued in accordance with
Sub-Clause 12.2.

12.2  Taking-Over Certificate
The Contractor may apply by notice to the Engineer for a
Taking-Over Certificate not earlier than 14 days before the
Works will in the Contractor's opinion be complete and ready
for taking over under Sub-Clause 12.1.

The Engineer shall within 21 days after the receipt of the
Contractor's application either:

a)   issue the Taking-Over Certificate to the Contractor, with
a copy to the Employer, stating the date on which the
Works were substantially complete and ready for taking
over, or

b)   reject the application giving his reasons and specifying
the work required to be done by the Contractor to enable
the Taking-Over Certificate to be issued.

If the Engineer fails either to issue the Taking-Over
Certificate or to reject the Contractor's application
within the period of 21 days, he shall be deemed to have
issued the Taking-Over Certificate on the last day of that
period.

The Contractor shall be entitled to apply for separate
Taking-Over Certificates for each such section.


1-44
<PAGE>   65
12.3  Use Before Taking Over
The Employer and/or the Engineer shall not use any part of the
Works unless a Taking-Over Certificate has been issued by the
Engineer in respect thereof.

If nevertheless, the Employer and/or Engineer uses any Section
of the Works, that Section which is used shall be deemed to
have been Taken Over at the date of such use.  The Engineer
shall on request of the Contractor issue a Taking-Over
Certificate accordingly.

If the Employer and/or Engineer uses the Works before taking
over, the Contractor shall be given the earliest opportunity to
take such steps as may be necessary to carry out the Tests on
Completion.

The provisions of Sub-Clause 10.5 shall not apply to any
Section of the Works while being so used by the Employer.
Clause 15 shall apply as if the Section had been taken over on
the date it was used by the Employer.

12.4  Interference with Tests on Completion
If the Contractor is prevented from carrying out the Tests on
Completion by a cause for which the Employer or the Engineer,
or other contractors employed by the Employer are responsible,
the Employer shall be deemed to have taken over the Works on
the date when the Tests on Completion would have been completed
but, for such prevention.  The Engineer shall issue a
Taking-Over Certificate accordingly.

The Works shall not be deemed to have been taken over if they
are not substantially in accordance with the Contract.

If the Works are taken over under this Clause, the Contractor
shall nevertheless carry out the Tests on Completion during the
Defects Liability Period.  The Engineer shall require the Tests
on Completion to be carried out by 14 days notice and in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Clause 11.

Any additional costs to which the Contractor may be put in
making the Tests on Completion during the Defects Liability
Period, shall be added to the Contract Price.


1-45
<PAGE>   66
13.                           PERFORMANCE TESTS

13.1  Carrying Out Tests
The Performance Tests prescribed under the Contract shall be
carried out after the Works have been taken over by the
Employer.

The Performance Tests shall demonstrate that the plant is
capable of performing as designed and specified in the
Contract.

13.2  Notice
The Employer has to give to the Contractor, with a copy to the
Engineer, 21 days notice in writing of the date after which the
Employer will be ready to make the initial Performance Tests.
Unless otherwise agreed in writing the tests shall take  place
within 10 days after the said date on such day or days as the
Contractor shall notify the Employer in writing.

13.3  Facilities for Performance Tests
The Employer shall provide free of charge such labour,
materials, electricity, fuel, water, stores apparatus and all
things as may be requisite and reasonably demanded to carry out
such tests efficiently.

13.4  Procedure for Performance Tests
Performance Tests shall be carried out by the Employer and the
Engineer under the supervision of the Contractor pursuant to
such instructions as the Contractor may give in the course of
carrying out such Tests.  The Performance Tests shall be
carried out as far as practicable under the conditions detailed
in the Specification.

13.5  Cessation of Performance Tests
Every Performance Test shall be carried out to completion
unless either the Employer, or the Engineer on his behalf or
the Contractor shall order it to be stopped because its
continuance would endanger life or cause damage to the Plant.
Cessation of a Performance Test does not constitute a Test.

13.6  Adjustments and Modifications
If the Works or any portion thereof fails to pass any
Performance Test or repeat Performance Test or if any
Performance Test or repeat Performance Test is stopped before
its completion, such test shall





1-46
<PAGE>   67
be repeated as soon as practicable thereafter.  In agreement
with the Engineer the Employer shall permit the Contractor to
make adjustments and modifications to any part of the Works
before the repetition of any Performance Test and shall, if
necessary, shut down any part of the Works for such purpose and
re-start it after any adjustments or modifications have been
made.  All such adjustments and modifications shall be made by
the Contractor as soon as practicable in agreement with the
Engineer at his own expense.  The Contractor shall if so
required by the Engineer submit details of the adjustments or
modifications which he proposes to make to the Engineer for his
approval.

13.7  Costs of Performance Tests
All reasonable expenses to which the Employer may be put by the
repetition of Performance Tests shall be deducted from the
Contract Price unless the repetition of the Performance Tests
are necessitated by lack of suitable cane, failure or problems
with the cane yard or mill room equipment or other cause out of
the control of Contractor.

13.8  Evaluation of Performance Tests
The results of Performance Tests shall be compiled and
evaluated jointly by the Employer, the Engineer and the
Contractor on consequences of failure to pass the Performance
Tests.  Subject to all other conditions of the Contract the
Contractor shall not be responsible for any failure to pass
Performance Tests caused by deficiencies in equipment supplied
to the Contractor by Employer.

Provided the Contractor has met all other performance related
conditions of the Contract the Contractor shall not be held
responsible for any failure to meet performance guarantees if
the mill crushing rate during the 72 hour test period shall
vary from 4000 metric tones per day by more than 10% or if the
rate exceeds 4400 metric tones per 24 grinding hours or if the
crushing is not at a reasonable uniform rate over each of the
72 elapsed hours of the test.

13.9  Failure to Pass the Performance Tests
If the Works or any part there of shall fail to pass any
Performance Tests on the repetition thereof, the Employer shall
be entitled;


1-47
<PAGE>   68
a)   to order a repetition of the Performance Tests at the
expense of the Contractor, or

b)   to issue an acceptance certificate pursuant to the
provisions of Clause 14 if the Employer so wishes, and
recover from the Contractor any loss suffered by the
Employer by reason of the Works failing to achieve any
guaranteed performance, or

c)   to reject the Works or any part thereof where the
Contractor shall with all speed and at this own expense
make good the deficiency.  In case the Contractor shall
fail so to do the Employer may, provided he does so
without undue delay, take such steps, at the expense of
the Contractor, as may in all the circumstances be
reasonable to make good such deficiency.  Any Plant
provided by the Employer to replace defective Plant shall
comply with the Contract and shall be obtained at
reasonable prices.  The Contractor shall be entitled to
remove and retain all Plant that the Employer may have
replaced at the Contractor's expense.

13.10 Postponement and Adjustments of Modifications
If the Works fail to pass any Performance Test and the
Contractor in consequence proposes to make an adjustment or
modification   thereto, the Employer may notify the Contractor
that he does not wish such adjustment or modification to be
made until a time that is convenient to him.  In such event the
Contractor shall become entitled to the issue of an acceptance
certificate as if the Works has passed the Performance Test in
question, but the Contractor shall remain liable to carry out
the adjustment or modification and to satisfy the Performance
test within a reasonable time of being notified to do so by the
Employer.  If however the Employer fails to give any such
notice within twelve months of the acceptance of the Works, the
Contractor shall be relieved of any such obligation and the
Works shall be deemed to have passed such Performance Test.





1-48
<PAGE>   69
14.                              ACCEPTANCE

14.1  Issue of Acceptance Certificate
Subject to the provisions of Clause 13, the Employer shall
issue to the Contractor a certificate (herein called an
"acceptance certificate") stating that the Works are accepted
by the Employer as from the date thereof as soon as:

a)   the Works have been taken over by the Employer,
b)   the Works have passed all the Performance Tests, and
c)   the Works are currently free from any defects which the
Contractor is bound to make good.

In the event the Employer fails to issue to the Contractor an
Acceptance Certificate within 14 days of the earliest date
after which all Sections of the Works have satisfied all
Performance Tests, the Acceptance Certificate shall be deemed
to have been issued by the Employer for purpose of this Sub-
Clause.

14.2  Provisional Acceptance Certificate
If the Contractor is prevented from satisfying either paragraph
(a) or paragraph (b) of the preceding Sub-Clause within three
months of the taking-over of the Works by any matter which is
wholly beyond the Contractor's control he may apply to the
Employer for the issue of a provisional acceptance certificate
in respect of the Works.  The Employer shall thereupon issue
such certificate to the Contractor if the Employer is of the
opinion that but for the matter of prevention the Contractor
would have become entitled to an acceptance certificate under
the preceding Sub-Clause.

14.3  Uncompleted Performance Tests and Work
The issue of an provisional acceptance certificate shall
constitute a provisional acceptance by the Employer of the
Works.  All uncompleted work and all unsatisfied or uncompleted
Performance Tests shall be carried out as soon as practicable.
If matters wholly beyond the Contractor's control continue to
prevent the carrying out of all the uncompleted work throughout
the remainder of the relevant Defects Liability Period then at
the expiry of such period uncompleted work shall be treated as
having been omitted pursuant to a


1-49
<PAGE>   70
variation order of the Engineer and shall be valued
accordingly.  If matters wholly beyond the Contractor's control
continue to prevent the Carrying out of the Performance Tests
throughout the remainder of the relevant Defects Liability
Period then unless it is otherwise established that the Works
were throughout the said Defects Liability Period incapable of
passing any or all of such Performance Tests by reason of some
default of the Contractor, such tests shall at the end of the
Defects Liability Period be deemed to have been satisfied.

14.4  Revoking of Provisional Acceptance Certificate
If the Works shall fail to pass any of the Performance Tests
when carried out in pursuance of the preceding Sub-Clause, the
Employer may by further certificate (herein called a
"revocation certificate") issued to the Contractor revoke the
provisional acceptance certificate.

14.5  Defects Liability
Upon acceptance of the Works by the Employer under this Clause
the only remaining obligations of the Contractor in respect
thereof shall be his obligation to make good any defects during
the Defects Liability Period unless such acceptance is by
virtue of a provisional acceptance certificate.

15.                           DEFECTS LIABILITY

15.1  Defects Liability Period
When any Section of the Work is taken over separately from the
Works the Defects Liability Period for the Section shall
commence on the date it was taken over.

15.2  Making Good Defects
The Contractor shall subject to Sub-Clause 15.1, be responsible
for making good any defect in or damage to any part of the
Works which may appear or occur during the Defects Liability
Period and which arises from, either:

a)   Any defective materials, workmanship or design, or

b)   Any act or omission of the Contractor during the Defects
Liability Period.

The Contractor shall make good the defect or damage as soon as
practicable and at his own cost.


1-50
<PAGE>   71
15.3  Notice of Defects
If any such defect appears or damage occurs, the Employer or
the Engineer shall forthwith notify the Contractor thereof.  If
the Employer and the Engineer fail to notify the Contractor as
soon as practical of any defect, and the Employer continues to
use the Works prior to notice to the Contractor such that the
works are further damaged by the Employer's use, then the
Contractor will not be liable for repairing any additional
damages caused by the Employer's delay in notifying the
Contractor of the defect.

15.4  Extension of Defects Liability Period
The provisions of this Clause shall apply to all replacements
or renewals carried out by the Contractor as if the
replacements and renewals had been taken over on the date they
were completed.

The Defects Liability Period for the Works shall be extended by
a period equal to the period during which the Works cannot be
used by reason of a defect or damage.  If only part of the
Works is affected the Defects Liability Period shall be
extended only for that part.

In neither case shall the Defects Liability Period be extended
by more than one year.

When erection or delivery of Plant has been suspended under
Sub-Clause 9.1, the Contractor's obligation under this
Sub-Clause 15.4 shall not apply to any defects occurring more
than three years after it would have been delivered but for the
suspension.

15.5  Failure to Remedy Defects
If the Contractor fails to remedy a defect or damage within a
reasonable time as approved by the Engineer, the Employer may
fix a final time for remedying the defect or damage.

If the Contractor fails to do so, the Employer may:

a)   Carry out the work himself or by others at the
Contractor's risk and cost, provided that he does so in a
reasonable manner.  The costs properly incurred by the
Employer in remedying the defect or damage shall be
deducted from the Contract Price, but the Contractor shall
have no responsibility for such work, or





1-51
<PAGE>   72
b)   Require the Contractor to grant the Employer a reasonable
reduction in the Contract Price to be agreed or fixed by
arbitration under Sub-Clause 34.

15.6  Removal of Defective Work
If the defect or damage is such that repairs cannot be
expeditiously carried out on the Site, the Contractor may with
the consent of the Engineer or the Employer remove from the
Site for the purposes of repair any part of the Works which is
defective or damaged.

15.7  Further Tests/Performance Tests
If the replacements or renewals are such that they may affect
the performance of the Works, the Employer may request that
Performance Tests be repeated to the extent necessary.  The
request shall be made by notice within 28 days after the
replacement or renewal.  The Tests shall be carried out in
accordance with Clause 13.  If the Employer fails to request
the repetition of Tests within the 28 day time period specified
in this Sub-Clause the Employer's right to require such Tests
shall be terminated.

15.8  Right of Access
Until the Final Certificate of Payment has been issued, the
Contractor shall have the right of access to all parts of the
Works and to records of the working and performance of the
Works.

Such right of access shall be during the Employer's normal
working hours at the Contractor's risk and cost.  Access shall
also be granted to any duly authorized representative of the
Contractor whose name has been communicated in writing to the
Engineer.

Subject to the Engineer's approval which will not be
unreasonably withheld, the Contractor may also at his own risk
and cost make any tests which he considers desirable.

15.9  Contractor to Search
The Contractor shall, if required by the Engineer in writing,
search for the cause of any defect, under the direction of the
Engineer.  Unless the defect is one for which the Contractor is
liable under this Clause, the cost of the work carried out by
the Contractor in searching for the cause of the defect shall
be added to the Contract Price.


1-52
<PAGE>   73
15.10 Defects Liability Certificate
When the Defects Liability Period for the Works or any Section
thereof has expired and the Contractor has fulfilled all his
obligations under the Contract for defects in the Works or that
Section, the Engineer shall issue within 28 days to the
Employer and the Contractor a Defects Liability Certificate to
that effect.  If the Engineer fails to issue the Defects
Liability Certificate within 28 days of the Contractor's
fulfillment of his obligations under the Contract such Defects
Liability Certificate shall be deemed issued without further
action of the Engineer or Employer.

15.11 Defects in Free Issue Equipment
The Contractor shall not be liable for any defects resulting
from Free-Issue equipment specified and furnished by the
Employer or the Engineer subject the Condition of the Contract.

15.12 Exclusive Remedies
Except in the case of Gross Misconduct, the Employer's remedies
under this Clause shall be in place of and to the exclusion of
any remedy in relation to defects whatsoever.

16.                              VARIATIONS

16.1  Engineer's Right to Vary
The Engineer may by Variation Order to which the Contractor
shall comply at any time before the Works are taken over,
instruct the Contractor to alter, amend, omit, add to or
otherwise vary any part of the Works.

The Contractor may, however, at any time propose variations of
the Works to the Engineer.

The Contractor shall carry out such variations and be bound by
the same conditions, so far as applicable, as though the said
variations were stated in the Specification.  Provided that no
such variation shall, except with the consent in writing of the
Contractor and the Employer, be such as will, with any
variations already directed to be made, involve a net addition
to or deduction from the Contract Price of more than 5 percent
thereof.  In any case in which the Contractor has received any
such direction from the Engineer which either then or later
will, in the opinion of the Contractor, involve an increase or
decrease in the


1-53
<PAGE>   74
Contract Price, the Contractor shall as soon as reasonably
possible and before proceeding therewith advise the Engineer in
writing to that effect.  The amount to be added to or deducted
from the Contract Price shall be ascertained and determined in
accordance with the rates stated in the schedule of prices so
far as the same may be applicable, and where rates are not
stated or are not applicable such amount shall be such sum as
is determined by the Engineer to be reasonable in the
circumstances.

16.2  Variations in Excess of 5%
If, with the consent in writing of the Contractor and the
Employer, the total value of all variations ordered under the
provisions of this Clause exceeds 5 percent of the Contract
Price, the Contract Price shall be amended by such sum as shall
be agreed upon between the Employer and the Contractor.

16.3  Variation Order Procedure
Prior to any Variation Order under Sub-Clause 16.1 the Engineer
shall notify the Contractor of the nature and form of such
variation.

As soon as possible after having received such notice, the
Contractor shall submit to the Engineer:

a)   a description of work, if any, to be performed and a
program for its execution,
b)   the Contractor's proposal for any necessary modifications
to the Master Schedule according to Sub-Clause 10.3 or to
any of the Contractor's obligations under the Contract,
and
c)   the Contractor's proposals for adjustment to the Contract
Price.

Following the receipt of the Contractor's submission the
Engineer shall, after due consultation with the Employer and
the Contractor, decide as soon as possible whether or not the
variation shall be carried out.

If the Engineer decides that the variation shall be carried
out, he shall issue a Variation Order clearly identified as
such in accordance with the Contractor's submission or as
modified by agreement.  If the Engineer and the Contractor are
unable to agree the adjustment of the Contract Price, the
provisions of Sub-Clause 16.4 shall apply.


1-54
<PAGE>   75
16.4  Disagreement on Adjustment of the Contract Price
If the Contractor and the Engineer are unable to agree on the
adjustment of the Contract Price, the adjustment shall be
determined in accordance with the rates specified in the
Schedule of Prices.

If the rates contained in the Schedule of Prices are not
directly applicable to the specific work in question, suitable
rates shall be established by the Engineer reflecting the level
of pricing in the Schedule of Prices.

Where rates are not contained in the said Schedule, the amount
shall be such as is in all the circumstances reasonable.  Due
account shall be taken of any over-or under-recovery of
overheads by the Contractor in consequence of the variation.

The Contractor shall also be entitled to be paid:

a)   the cost any partial execution of the Works rendered
useless by any such variation,
b)   the cost of making necessary alterations to Plant already
manufactured or in the course of manufacture or of any
work done that has to be altered in consequence of such a
variation,
c)   any additional costs incurred by the Contractor by the
disruption of the progress of the Works as detailed in the
Program, and
d)   the net effect of the Contractor's finance costs,
including interest, caused by the variation.

The Engineer shall on this basis determine the rates or prices
to enable on-account payment to be included in certificates of
payment.

16.5  Variations on Manufacture and Drawings
If the Engineer shall make any variation in any part of the
Works such reasonable notice in writing shall be given to the
Contractor as will enable him to make his arrangements
accordingly.  In cases where Plant is already manufactured or
in the course of manufacture, or any work done or Drawings made
require to be altered, a reasonable sum in respect thereof
shall be allowed by the Engineer.  If, in the opinion of the
Contractor, any such variation is likely to prevent or
prejudice the Contractor from or in fulfilling any of his
obligations under the Contract, he shall notify the Engineer
thereof in writing and the Engineer shall decide forthwith
whether or not the same shall be


1-55
<PAGE>   76
carried out.  If the Engineer confirms his instructions in
writing the said obligations shall be modified to such an
extent as may be justified.  Until the Engineer so confirms his
instructions they shall be deemed not to have been given.

16.6  Contractor to Proceed
On receipt of a Variation Order, the Contractor shall forthwith
proceed to carry out the variation and be bound to these
Conditions in so doing as if such variation was stated in the
Contract.

The work shall not be delayed pending the granting of an
extension of the Time for Completion or an adjustment to the
Contract Price under Sub-Clause 16.4.

16.7  Records of Cost
In any case where the Contractor is instructed to proceed with
a variation prior to the determination of the adjustment to the
Contract Price in respect thereof the Contractor shall keep
records of the cost of undertaking the variation and of time
expended thereon.  Such records shall be open to inspection by
the Engineer at all reasonable times.

16.8  Monthly Variations Statement
The Contractor shall send to the Engineer, once in every month,
an account giving particulars, as full and detailed as
possible, of all claims for any additional payment to which the
Contractor may consider himself entitled and of all extra or
additional work ordered by the Engineer which he has executed
during the preceding month.  No claim for payment will be
considered unless included in such account.  Provided always
that the Engineer shall be entitled to authorize payment to be
made notwithstanding the Contractor's failure to comply with
this condition, if the Contractor has at the earliest
practicable opportunity, not exceeding 15 days notified the
Engineer that he intends to make a claim.  When the engineer
has received a Contractor's claim for additional payment as
mentioned above he shall after due consultation with the
Employer and the Contractor determine whether the Contractor is
entitled to additional payment and notify the parties
accordingly.

Engineer.  Neither party shall be limited in the proceedings before
such arbitrator to the evidence or arguments put before the Engineer
for the purpose of obtaining his said decision.  No decision given by
the Engineer in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall
disqualify him from being called as a witness and giving evidence
before the arbitrator on any matter whatsoever relevant to the
dispute or difference referred to the arbitrator as aforesaid.  The
reference to arbitration may proceed notwithstanding that the Works
shall not then be or be alleged to be complete, provided always that
the obligations of the Employer, the Engineer and Contractor shall
not be altered by reason of the arbitration being conducted during
the progress of the Works.  The arbitration award shall be binding
upon the parties.  The arbitration proceedings shall take place in

§
12.1.2

Work equal or exceed progress payments already received by the Contractor.
The
monthly draws will be calculated on a percentage of completion basis with final
costs subject to audit at the Owners option.




§
12.1.5
Each
Application for Payment shall be based on the most recent schedule of values
submitted by the Contractor in accordance with the Contract Documents. The
schedule of values shall allocate the entire Guaranteed Maximum Price among
the
various portions of the Work, except that the Contractor's Fee shall be shown
as
a single separate item. The schedule of values shall be prepared in such form
and supported by such data to substantiate its accuracy as the Architect may
require. This schedule, unless objected to by the Architect, shall be used
as a
basis for reviewing the Contractor's Applications for Payment.




§
12.1.6
Applications for Payment shall show the percentage of completion of each portion
of the Work as of the end of the period covered by the Application for Payment.
The percentage of completion shall be the lesser of (1) the percentage of that
portion of the Work which has actually been completed; or (2) the percentage
obtained by dividing (a) the expense that has actually been incurred by the
Contractor on account of that portion of the Work for which the Contractor
has
made or intends to make actual payment prior to the next Application for Payment
by (b) the share of the Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion
of
the Work in the schedule of values.




§
12.1.7
Subject
to other provisions of the Contract Documents, the amount of each progress
payment shall be computed as follows:




.1 take
that
portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable to completed Work
as
determined by multiplying the percentage of completion of each portion of the
Work by the share of the Guaranteed Maximum Price allocated to that portion
of
the Work in the schedule of values. Pending final determination of cost to
the
Owner of changes in the Work, amounts not in dispute shall be included as
provided in Section 7.3.8 of AIA Document A201-1997;




.2 add
that
portion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price properly allocable to materials and
equipment delivered and suitably stored at the site for subsequent incorporation
in the Work, or if approved in advance by the Owner, suitably stored off the
site at a location agreed upon in writing;




.3 add
the
Contractor's Fee, less retainage of ten percent ( 10% ).The Contractor's Fee
shall be computed upon the Cost of the Work described in the two preceding
Clauses at the rate stated in Section 5.1.2 or, if the Contractor's Fee is
stated as a fixed sum in that Subparagraph, shall be an amount that bears the
same ratio to that fixed-sum fee as the Cost of the Work in the two preceding
Clauses bears to a reasonable estimate of the probable Cost of the Work upon
its
completion; See Exhibit "E" for additional retainage information.




.4 subtract
the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner;




.5 subtract
the shortfall, if any, indicated by the Contractor in the documentation required
by Section 1.2.1.4 to substantiate prior Applications for Payment, or resulting
from errors subsequently discovered by the Owner's accountants in such
documentation; and




.6 subtract
amounts, if any, for which the Architect has withheld or nullified a Certificate
for Payment as provided in Section 9.5 of AIA Document A201-1997.




§
12.1.8
Except
with the Owner's prior approval, payments to Subcontractors shall be subject
to
retainage of not less than ten percent ( 10% ). The Owner and the Contractor
shall agree upon a mutually acceptable procedure for review and approval of
payments and retention for Subcontractors.




§
12.1.9
In
taking action on the Contractor's Applications for Payment, the Architect shall
be entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of the information
furnished by the Contractor and shall not be deemed to represent that the
Architect has made a detailed examination, audit or arithmetic verification
of
the documentation submitted in accordance with Section 12.1.4 or other
supporting data; that the Architect has made exhaustive or continuous on-site

§
12.2 FINAL PAYMENT

§
12.2.1
Final
payment, constituting the entire unpaid balance of the Contract Sum, shall
be
made by the Owner to

the
Contractor when:






.1


the
Contractor has fully performed the Contract except for the Contractor's
responsibility to correct Work as provided in Section 12.2.2 of AIA
Document A201-1997, and to satisfy other requirements, if any, which
extend beyond final payment; and











.2


a
final Certificate for Payment has been issued by the Architect.










§
12.2.2
The
Owner's final payment to the Contractor shall be made no later than 30 days
after the issuance of the Architect's final Certificate for Payment, or as
follows:




§
12.2.3
The
Owner's accountants will review and report in writing on the Contractor's final
accounting within 30 days after delivery of the final accounting to the
Architect by the Contractor. Based upon such Cost of the Work as the Owner's
accountants report to be substantiated by the Contractor's final accounting,
and
provided the other conditions of Section 12.2.1 have been met, the Architect
will, within seven days after receipt of the written report of the Owner's
accountants, either issue to the Owner a final Certificate for Payment with
a
copy to the Contractor, or notify the Contractor and Owner in writing of the
Architect's reasons for withholding a certificate as provided in Section 9.5.1
of the AIA Document A201-1997. The time periods stated in this Section 12.2.3
supersede those stated in Section 9.4.1 of the AIA Document
A201-1997.




§
12.2.4
If the
Owner's accountants report the Cost of the Work as substantiated by the
Contractor's final accounting to be less than claimed by the Contractor, the
Contractor shall be entitled to demand arbitration of the disputed amount
without a further decision of the Architect. Such demand for arbitration shall
be made by the Contractor within 30 days after the Contractor's receipt of
a
copy of the Architect's final Certificate for Payment; failure to demand
arbitration within this 30-day period shall result in the substantiated amount
reported by the Owner's accountants becoming binding on the Contractor. Pending
a final resolution by arbitration, the Owner shall pay the Contractor the amount
certified in the Architect's final Certificate for Payment.




§
12.2.5
If,
subsequent to final payment and at the Owner's request, the Contractor incurs
costs described in Article 7 and not excluded by Article 8 to correct defective
or nonconforming Work, the Owner shall reimburse the Contractor such costs
and
the Contractor's Fee applicable thereto on the same basis as if such costs
had
been incurred prior to final payment, but not in excess of the Guaranteed
Maximum Price. If the Contractor has participated in savings as provided in
Section 5.2, the amount of such savings shall be recalculated and appropriate
credit given to the Owner in determining the net amount to be paid by the Owner
to the Contractor.




ARTICLE
13 TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION

§
13.1
The
Contract may be terminated by the Contractor, or by the Owner for convenience,
as provided in Article 14 of AIA Document A201-1997. However, the amount to
be
paid to the Contractor under Section 14.1.3 of AIA Document A201-1997 shall
not
exceed the amount the Contractor would be entitled to receive under Section
13.2
below, except that the Contractor's Fee shall be calculated as if the Work
had
been fully completed by the Contractor, including a reasonable estimate of
the
Cost of the Work for Work not actually completed.




§
13.2
The
Contract may be terminated by the Owner for cause as provided in Article 14
of
AIA Document A201-1997. The amount, if any, to be paid to the Contractor under
Section 14.2.4 of AIA Document A201-1997 shall not cause the Guaranteed Maximum
Price to be exceeded, nor shall it exceed an amount calculated as
follows:




§
13.2.1
Take the
Cost of the Work incurred by the Contractor to the date of
termination;




§
13.2.2
Add the
Contractor's Fee computed upon the Cost of the Work to the date of termination
at the rate stated in Section 5.1.2 or, if the Contractor's Fee is stated as
a
fixed sum in that Section, an amount that bears the same ratio to that fixed-sum
Fee as the Cost of the Work at the time of termination bears to a reasonable
estimate of the probable Cost of the Work upon its completion; and




_____________________________________________________________________________________________

§
13.2.3
Subtract
the aggregate of previous payments made by the Owner.




§
13.3
The
Owner shall also pay the Contractor fair compensation, either by purchase or
rental at the election of the Owner, for any equipment owned by the Contractor
that the Owner elects to retain and that is not otherwise included in the Cost
of the Work under Section 13.2.1. To the extent that the Owner elects to take
legal assignment of subcontracts and purchase orders (including rental
agreements), the Contractor shall, as a condition of receiving the payments
referred to in this Article 13, execute and deliver all such papers and take
all
such steps, including the legal assignment of such subcontracts and other
contractual rights of the Contractor, as the Owner may require for the purpose
of fully vesting in the Owner the rights and benefits of the Contractor under
such subcontracts or purchase orders.




§
13.4
The Work
may be suspended by the Owner as provided in Article 14 of AIA Document
A201-1997; in such case, the Guaranteed Maximum Price and Contract Time shall
be
increased as provided in Section 14.3.2 of AIA Document A201-1997 except that
the term "profit" shall be understood to mean the Contractor's Fee as described
in Sections 5.1.2 and Section 6.4 of this Agreement.

ADDITIONAL
PROVISIONS

GENERAL
CONTRACT COST PLUS A FEE WITH A GMP, A111 - 2001






1.


Effect
of Additional Provisions.
These Additional Provisions control over conflicting portions of
the
attached
A111 (the Contract Form), the A201 General Conditions (the General
Conditions), and other Contract
Documents.











2.


Additional
General Conditions.
The General Conditions for this project shall be AIA A201,1997, subject
to
modification as set forth herein.











3.


Architect
Role.
The Architect shall advise and assist the Owner in accordance with
the
Agreement between the
Owner and Architect. The Architect shall determine or certify any
claim
between the Owner and Contractor.
However, the Architect shall not have authority either conclusively
or on
an interim basis, to determine
or certify any issue between the Owner and Contractor, including,
but not
limited to: the amount properly
due in connection with any progress payment or final payment, proper
costs
chargeable to the Project; and the proper amount of any change or
any
adjustment to the Contract Sum or Contract Time. Neither party shall
be
required to submit any issue other than a claim to the Architect.
A
decision, recommendation
or certificate by the Architect shall not be a condition precedent
to or
requirement for any claim,
right or obligation under the Contract or for any mediation, arbitration
or other remedy. Article 3.1.3
of the AIA 201 is deleted











4.


Building
Permit.
The Owner shall secure and pay for all building permits, land use
approvals, approvals from
any government agency and other permits and approvals necessary to
perform
the Work. If the Owner
does not secure such permits and approvals within the time periods
required in order to perform the work on a timely basis, the Contractor
shall be entitled to an appropriate adjustment to the Contract Sum
or
Contract
Time.











5.


Changes.
Unless otherwise agreed, additive change orders shall increase the
Contract Sum by the cost of the work, including the cost of any associated
design work plus a contractor's fee of four percent (4%) (or such
other change order fee as may be stated in the Contract documents)
and
deductive change orders shall reduce
the Contract Sum only by the cost of the work associated with the
deduction. For deductive changes,
the profit, overhead or fee associated with the subject work shall
not be
utilized in calculating the reduction to the Contract Sum. The Contract
Time shall be extended to reflect the impacts of any changes. Change
Orders signed by the parties shall not be deemed to address the cumulative
impacts on the Contract Sum
or Contract Time of numerous change orders, and such cumulative impacts
may be the subject of appropriate claim proceedings by Contractor.
If, in
connection with any change, the parties have not agreed
on the amount properly due in connection with the change or the
adjustment, if any, to the Contract Time
resulting from such change, or otherwise have not finalized a change
order, the Contractor may nonetheless
submit payment requests for change order work performed and materials
delivered as part of the normal payment process, and the Owner shall
in
good faith pay the undisputed portion of the change order
work and materials in accordance with the provisions hereof for progress
and final payments. If Owner
requests a proposal for a change in the Work and subsequently elects
not
to proceed with the change,
a Change Order shall be issued to reimburse Contractor for reasonable
costs incurred for estimating services
involved in the preparation of proposed revisions to the
Contract.











6


Change
Directives.
The Owner may utilize Construction Change Directives to direct changes
in
the work without
Contractor's written agreement only to the extent that the aggregate
costs
for all pending Construction
Change Directive work does not exceed $5,000. Contractor may refuse
to
perform any Construction
Change Directive where the anticipated costs associated with such
Construction Change












Owner
/s/
RSR




Contractor
/s/ EJO





































Directive,
together with incurred or projected costs on other Construction Change
Directives will exceed-$ 5,000.00.
Work initiated by Construction Change Directive but subsequently covered by
an
executed Change
Order shall not be included in such computation, provided that such Change
Order
is paid on a timely basis. In addition, for work performed under Change
Directive, Owner shall pay Contractor's costs of such work plus the applicable
fee (less retainage as provided herein) as part of the regular progress
payment
process pending finalization of a Change Order adjusting the Contract
Sum.






7


Miscellaneous
Site/Design Issues.
With respect to Contractor's review of contract documents, design
documents,
field conditions and submittals under Article 3 of the General Conditions,
Contractor shall perform
only such review as is reasonable and customary in the industry.
Contractor is entitled to perform the
Work in accordance with submittals approved by the Architect. Contractor
shall not be obligated to perform
any design, architectural or engineering services unless, and only
to the
extent, such services are specifically
required to be performed by Contractor by Contract Documents other
than
the General Conditions.
Any such design, architectural or engineering services required of
Contractor shall be performed
according to reasonable standards of care applicable to such professional
services. Contractor shall
not be responsible for the safety or adequacy of means, methods,
techniques, sequences and procedures
for the work specified in the Contract
Documents.











8.


Time
of Performance.
Contractor will endeavor to substantially complete the work as required,
subject to and conditioned on the delivery of the Notice to Proceed,
final
construction plans and the issuance of all required
building permits and approvals as specified. The Contract Time and
Contract Sum shall be adjusted
to reflect the impacts of design and permit delays, material increases
in
the general scope of the project,
changes, delays attributable to the Owner, Architect, and other factors
beyond Contractor's reasonable control. Owner recognizes that the
failure
to provide final plans and all required building permits
within the time set forth above will have a significant impact on
project
time and costs, in particular because of the potential for procurement
delays and winter conditions.











10.


Insurance.
To
the extent Contractor provides Builder's Risk or other insurance
applicable to the Project, the Contractor shall pay the deductible
associated with any claim. Contractor's insurance obligations shall
be
as set forth in the Insurance Requirements Exhibit, rather than those
in
the General Conditions.









11.
Drawings.
Owner
shall have the responsibility to procure timely responses from the Architect
to
Contractor's and
Subcontractors' requests for information or clarification regarding the drawings
or other aspects of the design or design intent. Owner acknowledges that the
failure to provide timely responses to such requests may have a material impact
on the progress of the Work. Contractor shall be entitled to an appropriate
adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time from any failure to provide
such
requested information within a time frame consistent with the project
schedule.






12.


Schedule
of Values.
The Contract Sum is effective with respect to the total cost of the
work
for the entire project
A schedule of values itemizing the categories of work constituting
the
project, if not already established,
shall be developed and agreed to by the parties. The schedule of
values is
informational only as
a reference for billing and evaluation. However, actual costs in
a
category may vary from and exceed the scheduled value for that category,
and the scheduled value for a category shall not be construed as
a limit
to the
costs that may be incurred in that
category.











13


Contractor's
Contingency.
The schedule of values and Contract Sum shall include a contractor's
contingency which contingency is for the sole use and benefit of
the
Contractor. Contractor may use the contingency for
any purpose relating to the project, including: cost overruns; delays;
or;
labor disputes; material or equipment price changes; and any other
cost
incurred by contractor in connection with the project Owner recognizes
that the contingency reflects the problems inherent in a project
of this
scale and that the Contract Sum
is based in part on the availability of this contingency. The Contractor's
contingency is not available for
use by or for the benefit of the Owner or any other party, and shall
not
be used to cover: changes to the work;
design revisions or problems; delays or interference of the Owner
Architect or third parties for
which












Owner
/s/
RSR




Contractor
/s/ EJO





































Contractor
is not responsible; matters related to land use proceedings; unknown conditions;
allowance adjustments;
unusually severe weather; or similar items for which Contractor is not
responsible. The unused
contingency will not be part of the shared savings should the final cost be
less
than the GMP.






14.


Allowances.
The Contract Sum may include allowances as identified in the Allowance
Exhibit or other Contract
Documents. The allowances are inserted to reflect costs in categories
that
have not been determined
at the present time. Actual costs will depend on future decisions
and
selections, and may vary substantially
from the allowance figures. The Allowances should not be viewed as
a
representation regarding
what the costs will actually be. On all allowance items, Contractor
shall
be entitled to his actual cost, the contract amount currently includes
fee
on the allowance amounts.. Where actual costs exceed the allowance,
the Contract Sum shall be increased by the added cost plus the
Contractor's Fee on those added costs;
where actual costs are less than the allowance, the Contract Sum
shall be
reduced by the amount by which
the actual costs are less than the allowance plus a reduction in
the
contractors fee in an amount equal
to 4% of of the amount that the actual cost is less than the
allowance.











15.


Labor
Rates.
Rates for project personnel are set forth in the Labor Rate Exhibit
L. The
time actually spent by
such personnel on work or tasks related to the project shall be charged
as
a cost of the work at the hourly rates
specified in Exhibit L. For the referenced personnel, these rates
shall be
used instead of actual costs and the other provisions of Article
7 of the
Contract Form shall not apply. The parties have agreed to use these
rates
in part because of the difficulty and expense of determining actual
labor
costs. The labor rates cover
all wages, salaries, vacation or sick time, burden and direct or
indirect
expense associated with such labor.
Contractor shall be entitled to revise said rates 12 months after
the
commencement date, provided that
any increase is consistent with (i) standard rates charged by Contractor,
and (ii) increases in construction
labor rates in the local market generally. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Articles 7 and 8 of the
Contract Form, costs of personnel at Contractor's principal office
or
other offices performing tasks specifically
related to the project shall be a recoverable project cost at the
specified rates.











16.


Equipment
Rates.
Rates for equipment owned by Contractor (but not subcontractors)
are
attached hereto on the Equipment Rate Exhibit L. The time actually
spent
utilizing such equipment on the project shall be charged
as a cost of the work at the rates specified in the Equipment Rate
Exhibit. These rates shall be used
instead of attempting to determine actual costs, and the other provisions
of Article 7 of the Contract Form
shall not apply. The parties have agreed to use these rates in part
because of the difficulty and expense
in determining actual costs. The equipment rates cover the acquisition
of
owned equipment, depreciation,
major maintenance etc. but do not include the costs of transportation
to
and from the site, fuel, minor
maintenance or the cost of associated operators. Contractor shall
be
entitled to revise said rates 12 months
after the commencement, provided that any increase is consistent
with (i)
standard rates charged by Contractor,
and (ii) increases in construction equipment rates in the local market
generally.











17.


Progress
Payments. Progress payments shall be calculated as
follows:











A.


Take
the value of the completed work through the date of the Application
for
Payment.











B.


Add
the costs of materials and equipment delivered and suitably stored
at the
site for subsequent
incorporation in the Work, or if approved in advance by the Owner,
suitably stored
off the site at a location agreed upon in
writing.











C.


Add
the Contractor's Fee based on value of the completed work and stored
material and equipment,
except as provided for in section 22 of this
exhibit.











D.


Deduct
retainage in the amount of 10% of cost billings related to
subcontractors











E.


Deduct
the aggregate of previous payment made by the
Owner.










Owner
/s/
RSR




Contractor
/s/ EJO








































Owner
shall pay the balance so computed to Contractor.






18.


Documentation.
The Application for Payment shall include information showing the
costs
incurred, and a
calculation showing the amount due. The Application need not include
underlying invoices or other cost
documents, provided that Owner shall have access to such documents
in
accordance with Article 11 of the Contract Form. The costs and expenses
associated with inspecting, auditing, copying or otherwise
reviewing Contractor's cost data shall be a cost of the
work.











19.


Materials
Delivered to the Site.
'Completed Work' for purposes of billing shall include materials
stored
on
site for incorporation into the work or stored at an offsite location
agreed to by Owner and Contractor.











20.


Warranty.











A.


For
a period of one year after substantial completion, Contractor warrants
that the Work will
be free from defects not inherent in the quality required or permitted
and
that the Work
will conform to the requirements of the Contract Documents. Work
not
conforming to
these requirements, including substitutions not properly approved
and
authorized, may be
considered defective. The Contractor's warranty excludes remedy for
damage
or defect

STANDARD
RATE SCHEDULE




Labor
shall
be
calculated based upon the standard rates set forth below times the actual
hours
worked and charged to the project. For the referenced personnel, these rates
shall be used
instead of actual costs and the other provisions of Article 7 of the Contract
Form shall not apply. Should there be any classification of labor not included
below but subsequently deemed to
be
necessary, said classification and a rate prevailing in the area shall be added
to the list and
the
Owner will be notified in writing. Should the Owner disagree with the rate
or
necessity for
the
additional classification, the Contractor will provide documentation supporting
the necessity
for the addition and the justification for the rate used. Should the Owner
still
object, Articles
9 & 10 of the General Condition shall be used to resolve the
matter.




The
parties have agreed to uses these rates in part because of the difficulty and
expense of determining
actual labor costs. The labor rates cover all wages, salaries, vacation or
sick
time, burden
and direct or indirect expense associated with such labor, but not including
incentive programs
which may be an additional cost of the work. In addition to the labor rates,
reasonable
housing and per diem expenses for out-of-town workers shall be a recoverable
cost of
the
work. None of the rates shown are applicable to the framing labor if CFG elects
to frame the project and not subcontract the framing work.

Equipment
owned
by
the Contractor (but not subcontractors) and utilized on the project shall
be
charged as a cost of the work at the rates specified below. These rates shall
be
used instead
of attempting to determine actual costs and the other provisions of Article
7 of
the Contract
Form shall not apply. The parties have agreed to use these rates in part because
of the
difficulty and expense in determining actual costs. The equipment rates cover
the acquisition
of owned equipment, depreciation, major maintenance etc. but do not include
the
costs
of
transportation to and from the site, fuel, minor maintenance or the cost of
associated operators.
Contractor shall be entitled to revise said rates 12 months after the
commencement,
provided that any increase is consistent with (i) standard rates charged by
Contractor, and (ii) increases in construction equipment rates in the local
market generally.

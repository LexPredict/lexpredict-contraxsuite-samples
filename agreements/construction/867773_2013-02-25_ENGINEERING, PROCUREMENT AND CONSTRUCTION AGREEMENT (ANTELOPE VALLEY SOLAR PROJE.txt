Any such additional Work shall be performed in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, including that such Work is in compliance with the PPA.  Prior to commencing any such additional Work, Contractor shall provide to Owner a detailed plan and schedule to perform such additional Work and shall not commence any such additional Work without Owner's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.  There shall not be a limit to the number of times the Capacity Test may be repeated pursuant to the previous sentence ***.

If any Block or the Facility experiences a single point failure (i.e., a main transformer failure) prior to or during a Capacity Test, Contractor may use temporary equipment which must remain in place until a permanent replacement can be installed; provided that such temporary equipment is approved by Owner (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld and in any event within *** of such request for approval) and complies with all Applicable Laws, Applicable Permits, Project Transaction Documents, Governmental Authorities and the PPA and such temporary equipment is not expected to have any adverse effect on the safe and reliable construction of the Block or Project.  All costs to install and remove the temporary equipment shall be to Contractor's account.

any dispute arising from such rejection is resolved in favor of Contractor or Owner does not respond and the Facility Substantial Completion Date is deemed to have occurred, with respect to the transfer of risk of loss, care, custody and control for purposes of Article 13, such date shall be the date of Owner's countersignature to the Certificate of Facility Substantial Completion or the date of deemed acceptance, as applicable.  If Owner fails to respond within such *** period, then such delay shall constitute an Owner-Caused Delay.  If Contractor receives a notice under subparagraph (b) above, Contractor shall take the necessary steps to achieve Facility Substantial Completion and the procedures set forth under this Section 16.5 shall be repeated until such time as the Certificate of Facility Substantial Completion has been accepted by Owner.  Any disputes regarding the existence or correction of any alleged deficiencies shall be resolved under Article 28.


16.6    Punch List.


(a)    Creation of Punch Lists.  Owner and Contractor shall agree upon the relevant Punch List Items to be completed by Contractor.  Contractor and Owner shall jointly walk-down the Block and confer together as to the items which should be included on the finalized punch list.  Contractor shall then reflect the result of such joint walk down and deliver the same to Owner for its review and approval, which submitted list shall be explicitly designated as the “Proposed Punch List” for the applicable Block.  The Proposed Punch List shall include only Punch List Items for such Block, and shall include a Punch List Estimate for the completion or repair of each such Punch List Item and Contractor's estimated schedule for completion therefor.  If Owner does not deliver any changes to the Proposed Punch List to Contractor within the later of (i) *** after  Contractor's submission to Owner of such Proposed Punch List and (ii) and (b) *** after the date of the joint walk-down, such delay shall constitute an Owner-Caused Delay.  The Proposed Punch List that is ultimately approved for a Block shall be referred to as the “Punch List” for such Block.  If the Punch List for a Block is not finalized by the Block Substantial Completion Date for such Block, the Proposed Punch List as modified by Owner shall be deemed the Punch List for such Block for all purposes hereunder until the Parties resolve such dispute and otherwise finalize the Punch List for such Block.  Contractor shall note on such Punch List the items under dispute.


(b)    Completion of Punch Lists.  Contractor shall proceed promptly to complete and correct the Punch List Items relating to the relevant Block or the Facility, as applicable, no later than *** after the relevant Block Substantial Completion Date or Facility Substantial Completion Date, as applicable.  On a monthly basis after the Block Substantial Completion of a Block, Contractor shall prepare a punch list for such Block to include the date(s) that items listed on such Punch List are completed by Contractor and accepted by Owner.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the items listed on such Punch List shall not be considered complete until Owner shall have inspected such Punch List Items and acknowledged, by notation on the updated Punch Lists, that such item of Work is complete.  If Owner does not so inspect and deliver such notations on the updated Punch Lists to Contractor (or dispute completion of the applicable items of Work if not accepted) within *** after Contractor submits the updated Punch List containing such Punch List Item to Owner, and Contractor has actually completed and

corrected any Punch List Item listed on such Punch List, such failure by Owner shall constitute an Owner-Caused Delay.  Contractor shall use best efforts to complete the Punch List Items in such a manner as to prevent any loss of power production to the Facility and Contractor shall not curtail or interrupt operation of the Project without Owner consent.  Contractor will be responsible for all costs incurred during the completion of the Punch List Items.


(c)    Creation of Project Punch List.  Owner and Contractor shall agree upon the relevant Punch List Items to be completed by Contractor.  Contractor and Owner shall jointly walk-down the Project and confer together as to the items which should be included on the finalized punch list for the Project.  Contractor shall prepare a punch list for the Project to reflect the result of such joint walk down and deliver the same to Owner for its review and approval, which submitted list shall be explicitly designated as the “Proposed Project Punch List” and shall set forth all Work remaining to be completed after the Facility Substantial Completion Date.  The Proposed Project Punch List may only contain Punch List Items, and shall include a Punch List Estimate for the completion or repair of each such Punch List Item and Contractor's estimated schedule for completion therefor.  If Owner does not approve the Proposed Project Punch List or deliver any changes to the Proposed Project Punch List to Contractor within *** after the later to occur of (a) Contractor's submission to Owner of such Proposed Project Punch List, and (b) *** after the date of the joint walk-down, then such failure shall constitute an Owner-Caused Delay.  The Proposed Project Punch List that is ultimately approved by Owner for the Project shall be referred to as the “Project Punch List”.  If the Project Punch List is not finalized by the Facility Substantial Completion Date, the Proposed Project Punch List as modified by Owner shall be deemed the Project Punch List for all purposes hereunder until the Parties resolve such dispute and otherwise finalize the Project Punch List.  Contractor shall note on such Project Punch List the items under dispute.   Contractor shall use best efforts to complete the Punch List Items in such a manner as to prevent any loss of power production to the Facility and Contractor shall not curtail or interrupt operation of the Project without Owner consent.  Contractor will be responsible for all costs incurred during the completion of the Punch List Items.

*** CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED AND SEPARATELY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.



58






***  Block Delay Liquidated Damages shall cease to accrue upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Block Substantial Completion Date for such Block and (ii) the Guaranteed Facility Substantial Completion Date.  After taking into account the set-off against the bonus payable under Section 17.1(b) in accordance with Section 17.4, any amount Contractor is obligated to pay to Owner under this Section 17.1(a) shall be due and payable within *** after Contractor's receipt of Owner's invoice submitted not more frequently than monthly following the Guaranteed Block Substantial Completion Date of the Late Block.


(b)    Contractor shall be entitled to a bonus payment equal to, for each Day, ***.  Contractor shall not be entitled to any bonus under this Section 17.1(b) after the earlier of (i) Facility Substantial Completion or (ii) the Guaranteed Facility Substantial Completion Date.

17.2    Guaranteed Facility Substantial Completion Delay Liquidated Damages.  If Contractor has not achieved Facility Substantial Completion by the Guaranteed Facility Substantial Completion Date for reasons not excused under the terms of this Agreement, then Contractor shall pay to Owner delay liquidated damages (“Facility Delay Liquidated Damages”) equal to, for each Day after the Guaranteed Facility Substantial Completion Date that the Facility has not achieved Facility Substantial Completion, ***; provided that any amounts that Contractor is obligated to pay to Owner under this Section 17.2 are subject to the limitations set forth in Article 29.  Payment of Facility Delay Liquidated Damages shall be made payable within *** after Contractor's receipt of Owner's invoice.


17.3    Block Capacity Liquidated Damages.  If after the Block Substantial Completion Date of a Block (if such date is on or after the Guaranteed Block Substantial Completion Date for such Block), the Final Test Results of the most recent Capacity Test for such Block demonstrates that the Block meets the Minimum Capacity Level but not the Guaranteed Capacity (adjusted for uncertainty in accordance with Exhibit 16A) for such Block, Contractor shall pay to Owner liquidated damages for such shortfall (“Block Capacity Liquidated Damages”) in an amount equal to, for each Day that the Block Measured Capacity of such Block is below the Guaranteed Capacity (adjusted for uncertainty in accordance with Exhibit 16A) of such Block, ***; provided that any amounts that Contractor is obligated to pay to Owner under this Section 17.3 are subject to the limitations set forth in Article 29.  Block Capacity Liquidated Damages shall cease to accrue upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which a Capacity Test for such Block demonstrates that such Block has achieved the Guaranteed Capacity (adjusted for uncertainty in accordance with Exhibit 16A) and (ii) the date that any Final Capacity Liquidated Damages are paid.  After taking into account the set-off against the bonus payable under Section 17.1(b) in accordance with Section 17.4, any amount Contractor is obligated to pay to Owner under this Section 17.3 shall be due and payable within *** after Contractor's receipt of Owner's invoice submitted not more frequently than monthly.

17.4    Netting.  If any undisputed Block Delay Liquidated Damages are payable pursuant to Section 17.1(a) or any undisputed Block Capacity Liquidated Damages are payable pursuant to Section 17.3, the aggregate amount of undisputed Block Delay Liquidated Damages and undisputed Block Capacity Liquidated Damages payable shall be set-off against the aggregate amount of undisputed bonus payable pursuant to Section 17.1(b) on a pro rata basis, and (a) Contractor shall pay the net amount (if any) of undisputed Block Delay Liquidated Damages and the undisputed Block Capacity Liquidated Damages to Owner in accordance with Section 17.1(a) and Section 17.3, respectively and (b) Owner shall pay the net amount (if any) of undisputed bonus payable pursuant to Section 17.1(b).


17.5    Final Capacity Liquidated Damages.

(a)    Contractor agrees that if based on the results of the Facility Capacity calculation performed in accordance with Exhibit 16A, the Facility shall have failed to achieve the Guaranteed Capacity, Contractor shall pay to Owner upon Facility Substantial Completion an amount equal to *** (the “Final Capacity Liquidated Damages”).


(b)    In the event Contractor has paid Final Capacity Liquidated Damages pursuant to Section 17.5(a), and, following additional Capacity Tests conducted in compliance with the provisions set forth in Section 15.5, if the Facility Capacity calculation resulting from the last of such additional Capacity Tests (i) reduces the Capacity Shortfall, Owner shall reimburse Contractor the corresponding amount of Final Capacity Liquidated Damages resulting from such reduction or (ii) increases the Capacity Shortfall, Contractor shall pay to Owner additional Final Capacity Liquidated Damages calculated in accordance with Section 17.5(a).


(c)    Amounts payable by Contractor to Owner pursuant to Section 17.5(b) may be set off by Owner against the payment due for Final Completion on the final Application for Payment.  Any amounts that Contractor is obligated to pay to Owner under Sections 17.5(a) or 17.5(b) are subject to the limitations set forth in Article 29.  After Contractor's payment of Final Capacity Liquidated Damages, Contractor shall have no further obligation to try to achieve, and no further liability to Owner for failure to achieve, the Guaranteed Capacity.


17.6    Liquidated Damages Reasonable.  The Parties agree that the extent and amount of loss or damage to Owner as result of Contractor's failure (a) to achieve Block Substantial Completion by the Guaranteed Block Substantial Completion Date of a Block, (b) to achieve Facility Substantial Completion by the Guaranteed Facility Substantial Completion Date and (c) to achieve the Guaranteed Capacity for a Block or the Facility is impractical and difficult to determine with certainty.  The Parties agree that such liquidated damages are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages suffered by Owner by reason of Contractor's failure to achieve or cause the Project to satisfy, obtain or achieve each Guaranteed Block Substantial Completion Date, the Guaranteed Facility Substantial Completion Date or the Guaranteed Capacity for a Block or the Facility and are not intended as a penalty.  *** the amounts payable by Contractor to Owner under this Article 17 shall be Contractor's sole and exclusive liability to Owner, and Owner's sole and exclusive remedy, with respect to Contractor's failure (i) to achieve Block Substantial

Completion of a Block by its Guaranteed Block Substantial Completion Date, (ii) to achieve Facility Substantial Completion by the Guaranteed Facility Substantial Completion Date or (iii) to achieve the Guaranteed Capacity for a Block or the Facility.  If Contractor fails to pay any Block Delay Liquidated Damages, Facility Delay Liquidated Damages, Block Capacity Liquidated Damages or Final Capacity Liquidated Damages owing under this Article 17, Owner may deduct the amount thereof from any payment due, or that may become due, to Contractor under this Agreement or if no payment is due, may invoice Contractor for such amount.  Nothing in this Article 17 shall be construed as relieving Contractor of its obligation to achieve Facility Substantial Completion.


17.7    Energy and Revenues of the Project.  Any energy or revenues generated by the Project at any time, including during the performance of any testing, shall be solely for the benefit of Owner.  This Section 17.7 shall not limit Contractor's right to receive any bonus in accordance with Section 17.1(b).


17.8    EITC and Depreciation Loss.


(a)    The Parties acknowledge that the Contract Price reflects, in part, the value to Owner of certain tax benefits (as specified below) and to obtain those tax benefits in accordance with the expected schedule for the construction and completion of the Project.


(b)    If any Block is not completed in accordance with the Guaranteed Block On-line Schedule (as in effect on the Effective Date) for any reason other than, subject to Section 17.8(f), an Owner-Caused Delay, an Excusable Event, a Force Majeure Event (but only with respect to subclause (ii) below) or an Owner Event of Default, then Contractor shall pay Owner, as a Contract Price adjustment and not as a penalty, the following amounts:


(i)    an amount equal to ***, and

(ii)    an amount for each Block equal to the equivalent of interest (using the Wall Street Journal “prime rate” as of the dates specified below as an annual rate, compounded annually) on the following amounts, determined as follows:  ***. For the avoidance of doubt, there is to be no “double counting” of the interest factors calculated under Sections 17.8(b)(ii)(A) and 17.8(b)(ii)(C) with respect to EITCs, and in the event the interest factor determined under Section 17.8(b)(ii)(A) includes with respect to the reduced EITCs reimbursed under Section 17.8(b)(i) a portion of the time value captured under Section 17.8(b)(ii)(B) with respect to the deferral of EITCs, then the amount due under Section 17.8(b)(ii)(B) shall be reduced by the amount of such overlap.


(c)    Any Contract Price adjustment required by Section 17.8(b), shall be paid within *** of Owner providing Contractor a written request setting forth the calculations in reasonable detail.


*** CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED AND SEPARATELY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.



61






(d)    Within *** of receipt of such request, Contractor may request that *** (so long as they are not the accounting firm used by either Party) or another nationally recognized independent accounting firm selected by Owner and reasonably acceptable to Contractor verify the calculation.  The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne by Contractor; provided, however, if the accounting firm determines that Owner's calculations were overstated by more than five (5) percent, then Owner shall pay (or, if applicable, reimburse Contractor) for such fees and expenses.  Absent manifest error, the determination of such accounting firm shall be final and binding upon the parties.


(e)    The calculation of any amount due pursuant to Section 17.8(b) is intended to be hypothetical.  Therefore, the amount shall not be altered based on (i) Owner's actual federal income tax posture or liability, (ii) any audit or adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service, (iii) any transfer, merger, sale, reorganization, lease, financing or other transaction entered into by Owner or any Affiliate thereof, (iv) any tax election made by Owner or any Affiliate thereof, (v) any penalties or interest payable to any tax authority, and (vi) all state tax items shall be disregarded.


(f)    ***


17.9    Enforceability.  The Parties explicitly agree and intend that the provisions of this Article 17 shall be fully enforceable by any court exercising jurisdiction over any dispute between the Parties arising under this Agreement.  Each Party hereby irrevocably waives any defenses available under law or equity relating to the enforceability of the liquidated damages provisions set forth in this Article 17 on the grounds that such liquidated damages provisions should not be enforced as constituting a penalty or a forfeiture.

FINAL COMPLETION


18.1    Generally.  Contractor shall achieve Final Completion of the Facility by the earlier of (a) *** after the Facility Substantial Completion Date and (b) *** (the “Guaranteed Final Completion Date”); provided that Contractor shall have an *** cure period if Final Completion is not achieved.

18.3    Failure to Achieve Final Completion.  If Owner fails to issue a Certificate of Final Completion pursuant to Section 18.2(a) or a written notice under Section 18.2(b) above within *** after receipt of Contractor's notice under Section 18.2, Final Completion shall be deemed to have been achieved as of the date Contractor gave its notice to Owner under Section 18.2.  If Contractor receives a notice under Section 18.2(b) above, Contractor shall take the necessary steps to achieve Final Completion of the Facility at Contractor's cost.  Upon completion of such corrective action, Contractor shall provide a new notice of Final Completion to Owner for approval and the procedures set forth under Sections 18.2 and 18.3 shall be repeated until such time as the Certificate of Final Completion has been accepted by Owner. Any disputes regarding the existence or correction of any alleged deficiencies shall be resolved under Article 28.

The Indemnitee's failure to give, or tardiness in giving, such Claim Notice will reduce the liability of the Indemnifying Party only by the amount of damages attributable and prejudicial to such failure or tardiness, but shall not otherwise relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have under this Agreement.  If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such proceeding and to participate in (but not control) the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee unless the Indemnifying Party agrees otherwise; provided that if the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party requires that the same counsel represent both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party, and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.  If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of the Indemnitee, does not diligently prosecute such defense, or if a conflict precludes counsel for Indemnifying Party from providing the defense, then the Indemnitee shall have the absolute right to control the defense of such claim and the fees and expenses of such defense, including reasonable attorneys' fees of the Indemnitee's counsel, reasonable costs of investigation, court costs and other costs of suit, arbitration, dispute resolution or other proceeding, and any reasonable amount determined to be owed by Indemnitee pursuant to such claim, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in (but not control) such defense and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnitee on a monthly basis for such costs and expenses.  Subject to all of the foregoing provisions of this Section 24.5 as between the Parties, the Indemnifying Party shall control the settlement of all claims, in coordination with any insurer as required under the applicable insurance policies in Article 23 as to which it has assumed the defense; provided that to the extent the Indemnifying Party, in relation to such insurer, controls settlement:  (a) such settlement shall include a dismissal of the claim and an explicit release from the party bringing

such claim or other proceedings of all Indemnitees; and (b) the Indemnifying Party shall not conclude any settlement without the prior approval of the Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided further that except as provided in the preceding sentence concerning the Indemnifying Party's failure to assume or to diligently prosecute the defense of any claim, no Indemnitee seeking reimbursement pursuant to the foregoing indemnity shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, settle, compromise, consent to the entry of any judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding for which indemnity is afforded hereunder unless such Indemnitee reasonably believes that the matter in question involves potential criminal liability against such Indemnitee.  Other than as provided in this Section 24.5, Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim without the prior written approval of the Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Indemnitee shall provide reasonable assistance to the Indemnifying Party when the Indemnifying Party so requests, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, in connection with such legal action or claim, including executing any powers-of-attorney or other documents required by the Indemnifying Party with regard to the defense or indemnity obligations.


24.6    Defense to Indemnification Obligations.  ***


24.7    Comparative Fault.  Except as expressly provided to the contrary herein, it is the intent of the Parties that where fault is determined to have been joint or contributory, principles of comparative fault will be followed and each Party shall bear the proportionate cost of any Losses attributable to such Party's fault.


24.8    Survival of Indemnity Obligations.  The indemnities set forth in this Article 24 shall survive the Final Completion Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement for a period (the “Survival Period”) expiring *** following the Final Completion Date or said termination, whichever first occurs; provided that (i) with respect to indemnities arising out of or related to the Warranties, the indemnities shall survive for a period of *** after the last Day of the applicable Warranty Period; (ii) indemnities arising out of or related to environmental matters (including as set forth in Article 12) shall survive for a period expiring *** following the Final Completion Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, whichever first occurs; (iii) the indemnities set forth in Section 24.1(p) and Section 24.3, shall survive for a period expiring *** following the Final Completion Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement; and (iv) indemnities arising out of or related to Tax shall survive for a period equal to the later of *** following the Final Completion Date and the applicable statute of limitations plus ***.  All Claim Notices must be delivered, if at all, to the applicable Party prior to the expiration of such applicable Survival Period.  If any Claim Notice is made within such Survival Period, then the indemnifying period with respect to all claims identified in such Claim Notice (and the indemnity obligation of the Parties hereunder with respect to such claim) shall extend through the final, non-appealable resolution of such claims.  For purposes of clarification hereunder, without limiting the other rights granted hereunder to either Party, a Party may enforce the indemnity provisions hereunder pursuant to the provisions of this Article 24 without having to declare an Owner Event of Default or a Contractor Event of Default, as applicable.

25.2    DAS System Information.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 25, Contractor, SunPower Corporation and any Affiliate of SunPower Corporation shall have the right to remotely access the DAS System installed by Contractor in the Facility in order to collect all plant data for its own uses to the end of the Warranty Period.

84






26.2    Exceptions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Owner shall be entitled to assign its right, title and interest in and to this Agreement (and, in particular, any rights arising in relation to any insurance policy and any other right to collect any amount from Contractor) to the Financing Parties by way of security for the performance of obligations to such Financing Parties without the consent of Contractor who, subject to any consent entered into by Contractor with the Financing Parties, may further assign such rights, title and interest under this Agreement upon exercise of remedies by a  Financing Party following a default by Owner under the financing agreements entered into between Owner and the Financing Parties and (b) each Party shall be entitled to assign its right, obligation, title and interest in and to this Agreement to any of its Affiliates or in connection with a merger or acquisition of substantially all of the assets of a Party, subject to the ***, as applicable, and continued validity thereof.  Contractor shall execute any consent and agreement or similar documents with respect to such an assignment described in subclause (a) as the Financing Parties may reasonably request and acknowledges that such consent and agreement or similar document (which shall be reasonably acceptable to Contractor) may, among other things, require Contractor to give the Financing Parties notice of, and an opportunity to cure, any breach of this Agreement by Owner.  Contractor shall reasonably cooperate with Owner in the negotiation and execution of any reasonable amendment or addition to this Agreement required by the Financing Parties; provided, however, that Contractor shall not be obligated without a Change Order under Section 11.4(b) to accept any undertaking imposed by any Financing Party which Contractor reasonably believes will have an actual and demonstrable increase in Contractor's costs and/or schedule.  Contractor shall, at Owner's cost and subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in Article 25, make available to the Financing Parties and other Persons involved in the financing or refinancing of the Facility who have a need-to-know (e.g., counsel to a lender or any such other Person, Governmental Authority, underwriters, rating agencies, independent reviewers and feasibility consultants) such information in the control of Contractor (including financial information concerning Contractor) as may reasonably be requested by Owner on behalf of the Financing Parties or the Financing Parties' engineer with respect to financing of the Project or the Facility.  Contractor further agrees that, in connection with the financing or refinancing of the Facility, Contractor shall, at the request and expense of Owner, provide an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability against Contractor of this Agreement until expiration of the last Warranty Period. Any authorized assignment of this Agreement by either Party shall relieve such Party of its obligations hereunder at such time as the authorized successor agrees in writing to be bound by such assigning Party's obligations hereunder.  Any purported assignment of this Agreement in violation of this Section 26.2 shall be null and void and shall be ineffective to relieve either Party of its obligations hereunder.


26.3    Indemnitees; Successors and Assigns.  Upon any assignment by either Party hereunder, with respect to indemnification obligations, the definition of “Owner Party” or “Contractor Party”, as applicable, shall be deemed modified to include the assignor and permitted assignee under such assignment and each of their respective employees, agents, partners, Affiliates, shareholders, officers, directors, members, managers, successors and permitted assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of each Party.

MISCELLANEOUS


31.1    Severability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any portion or provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other portion or provision hereof.  Any invalid or unenforceable portion or provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement and the balance of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if this Agreement did not contain such invalid or unenforceable portion or provision.  If any such provision of this Agreement is so declared invalid, the Parties shall promptly negotiate in good faith new provisions to eliminate such invalidity and to restore this Agreement as near as possible to its original intent and effect (including economic effect).


31.2    Third Party Beneficiaries.  The provisions of this Agreement are intended for the sole benefit of Owner and Contractor and there are no third-party beneficiaries hereof (except as expressly set forth herein).

31.4    No Waiver.  A Party's waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any of the terms, covenants, conditions or other provisions of this Agreement at any time shall not in any way affect, limit, modify or waive that Party's right thereafter to enforce or compel strict compliance with every term, covenant, condition or other provision hereof, any course of dealing or custom of the trade notwithstanding.

Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, Owner shall not unreasonably delay its review of any item submitted by Contractor for review or approval for review or approval; provided, however, the foregoing shall not be used to decrease any express time limitation for such review or approval set forth herein.  Any review, inspection, monitoring or observation by Owner or its representatives in accordance with this Agreement shall not constitute any approval of the Work undertaken by such Person, cause Owner to have any responsibility for the actions, the Work or payment of such Person (other than in respect of Owner's obligations to pay Contractor in accordance with Article 7) or to be deemed to be in an employer-employee relationship with Contractor or any Subcontractor, or in any way relieve Contractor of its responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement or be deemed to be acceptance by Owner with respect to such Work.

Contractor may at any time, but shall be under no obligation to, set-off any and all undisputed sums due from Contractor or its Affiliates that are party to the Project Transaction Documents against any and all undisputed sums due to any such parties from, Owner or its Affiliates that are party to the Project Transaction Documents.

Except as specifically set forth herein, each Party shall be responsible for any legal fees and expenses, financial advisory fees, accountant fees and any other fees and expenses incurred by such Party in connection with the negotiation, preparation and enforcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.


31.13    Related Contracts.  Services and work performed at any time by Contractor or its Affiliates under the Module Warranty, the Performance Guaranty Agreement or the O&M Agreement shall not constitute Work hereunder. Owner shall use reasonable efforts to make claims against Contractor under the appropriate contract (this Agreement, the Module Warranty, the Contractor Performance Security, the Performance Guaranty Agreement or the O&M

92






Agreement).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractor shall not contend that it is not liable for any claim of Owner under or arising out of this Agreement on the grounds that the loss or damage suffered by Owner was caused by an act or omission or the failure to comply with the terms of the other Project Transaction Documents by Contractor, its Affiliates or any other Person for which Contractor or its Affiliates are responsible (including subcontractors), and Contractor irrevocably waives any such defense in any Dispute. Contractor shall inform Owner if it believes that Owner made a claim under the wrong Project Transaction Document.  If Contractor and Owner do not agree that such claim should have been made under a different Project Transaction Document, Contractor and Owner shall resolve any such dispute regarding which Project Transaction Document a claim should have been made under by submitting such dispute to dispute resolution in accordance with Article 28.


31.14    Audit Rights.  With respect to any Change Order which adjusts the Contract Price by compensating Contractor on a reimbursable cost or time and materials basis, Contractor shall maintain, in accordance with Industry Standards and generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, records and books of account as may be necessary for substantiation of all Contractor claims for additional compensation or Change Orders.  Owner, Owner's Engineer, the Financing Parties (except for any Financing Party that is a SunPower Competitor other than an Eligible SunPower Competitor), if any, and their authorized representatives shall be entitled to inspect and audit such records and books of account during normal business hours and upon reasonable advanced notice during the course of the Work and for a period of *** after Final Completion (or such longer period, where required by Applicable Law); provided, however, that the purpose of any such audit shall be only for verification of such costs, and Contractor shall not be required to keep records of or provide access to those of its costs covered by the fee, allowances, fixed rates, unit prices, lump sum amounts, or of costs which are expressed in terms of percentages of other costs.  Contractor shall retain all such records and books of account for a period of at least *** after the Final Completion Date (or such longer period, where required by Applicable Law).  Contractor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Major Subcontractors engaged in connection with the Work or the performance by Contractor of its warranty obligations herein to retain for the same period all their records relating to the Work for the same purposes and subject to the same limitations set forth in this Section 31.14.  Audit data shall not be released by the auditor to parties other than Contractor, Owner, Owner's Engineer, and their respective officers, directors, members, managers, employees and agents in connection with any such audit, subject to the provisions of Article 25.  If, as a result of any audit conducted pursuant to this Section 31.14, the results of such audit indicate that Contractor received more or less than the amount to which it was entitled under this Agreement, either Owner shall pay the additional amount owed to Contractor or Contractor shall refund any overpayment to Owner, as applicable, in either case within *** of a written request therefor.  Owner shall be responsible for all costs and expenses of such audit unless a significant overpayment by Owner is discovered, in which case Contractor shall be responsible for such costs and expenses.

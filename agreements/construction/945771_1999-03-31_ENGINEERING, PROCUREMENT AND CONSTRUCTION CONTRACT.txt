SECTION 11. TAXES

Price  is  exclusive  of  applicable  Taxes.  The  Purchaser  shall be
responsible for and shall pay all such Taxes. The Purchaser shall bear
responsibility  for  importation,  including  customs  clearances,  of
Supply to the relevant Site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this  Contract  shall be construed  as imposing  any  liability on the
Purchaser  with  respect  to any  Tax  levied  on or  attributable  to
property owned or income earned by the Contractor.

11.2. EXEMPTION FROM TAXES. The Contractor shall use all reasonable  efforts
to have all items of Work made exempt  from all Taxes,  whether in the
manufacture  thereof or  related to the  importation  or  location  or
installation  thereof, and shall cooperate fully with the Purchaser in
this respect.  The Contractor  hereby  undertakes to make applications
for such revisions and for drawbacks, remissions, reclassifications or
the like to the appropriate  Governmental  Authorities,  in accordance
with the relevant Laws then in force.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
should the Purchaser be made aware of any area of exemption from taxes
or  duties,  then  the  Purchaser  shall  identify  such  area  to the
Contractor, which shall investigate the same.

11.3. WITHHOLDING.  To the extent that any Law or Regulatory Authority shall

<PAGE>

The  Contract  Price shall  include  all  amounts  payable for patent,
copyright  and  other  industrial  or  intellectual  property  rights,
royalties or similar  expenses,  on or with respect to the Supplies or
Work or any part  thereof,  and,  without  limiting the  generality of
Section 40 hereof, the Contractor shall indemnify, protect, defend and
hold harmless each Purchaser  Person from and against all Losses based
upon,  arising  out of, or  otherwise  related to an  infringement  or
claimed  infringement  of patent,  copyright  or other  industrial  or
intellectual  property rights by reason of the manufacture,  purchase,
possession or use of the Supplies,  the Work or the System or any part
thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contractor shall be under
no obligation  to indemnify  the Purchaser  with respect to any Losses
relating  to  any  infringement  or  claimed  infringement  where  the
manufacture,  purchase,  possession or use for which  infringement  is
claimed was  undertaken by the Contractor at the  Purchaser's  express
instruction  and the  Supplies  or other  items of Work  manufactured,
purchased,  possessed  or  used  were  selected  or  furnished  by the
Purchaser.  The  Purchaser  shall,  in such cases,  indemnify and hold
harmless the Contractor from and against any Losses so incurred by the
Contractor at the Purchaser's direction.

12.2. INJUNCTION.  If, as a consequence of any action or claim  described in
Section 12.1 hereof, the use of the System is enjoined, the Contractor
shall use its best  efforts to  negotiate  with the  claimant so as to
remove  such  injunction  or  to  obtain  for  the  Purchaser  or  the
Contractor,  as the case  may be, a  license  or  other  agreement  in
respect  thereof as soon as possible.  Subject to Section 29.1, if the
Contractor is unable to have the  injunction  removed,  the Contractor
shall be liable to the  Purchaser  for  Losses  arising as a result of
such  injunction,  none of which shall  result in any  increase in the
Contract Price.

12.3. INFRINGEMENT.  If the System or any part thereof is held to constitute
infringement  and  is  subject  to an  order  restraining  its  use or
providing for its surrender or  destruction,  the Contractor  shall at
its own expense  promptly  (but in no event later than sixty (60) Days
after such injunction, or such shorter period imposed by any claimant)
either:

(a)  procure for the Purchaser the right to retain and continue to use
the affected System; or

(b)  modify the System so that it becomes non-infringing.

SECTION 13. PAYMENTS FOR THE WORK

13.1. INITIAL CONTRACT PRICE. The Contractor shall provide the System to the
Purchaser for a price of  [REDACTED] (the "INITIAL  CONTRACT  PRICE").
The Initial  Contract  Price is the price to be paid by the  Purchaser

all of its other  obligations  under this  Contract,  and shall not be
varied except as provided in Section 16 hereof.

13.2. GENERAL CONDITIONS OF PAYMENT.

(a)  PAYMENTS IN DOLLARS. All payments to the Contractor shall be made

(i)  If the Purchaser:

(A)  receives  a  notice,   order  or  instruction   from  a
competent Governmental Authority that a Tax is required
to be withheld by Law; or

(B)  otherwise  has a  reasonable  belief  that  any  Tax is
required  to be  withheld  from any  payment due to the
Contractor,

then the Purchaser  shall  promptly so inform the Contractor
as  far  in  advance  of  any   proposed   withholdings   as
practicable.

(ii)  The Contractor shall obtain  documentary  evidence from the
relevant taxing authorities reasonably  satisfactory to the
Purchaser  that the  Purchaser  is not required to withhold
such Tax.  If the  Contractor  is  unable  to  obtain  such
documentary  evidence on a timely basis, then the Purchaser
shall  proceed to withhold any such Tax via an escrow agent
or other  mutually  agreeable  procedure.  Thereafter,  the
Purchaser shall, at the Contractor's  expense,  provide any
documentation  or other  cooperation  as may be  reasonably
requested by the  Contractor  to permit the  Contractor  to
recover any  withheld  amounts to which the  Contractor  is
entitled.

(iii) The Contractor shall protect, defend, indemnify in full and
hold  harmless each  Purchaser  Person from and against any
Losses based upon,  arising out of or otherwise  related to
Taxes  that  are  owed  by the  Contractor  to  any  taxing
authority.

(d)  FINAL PAYMENT.  On receipt by the Contractor of the final payment
of the Contract Price (the "FINAL PAYMENT"):

(i)  the  Purchaser  shall  thereby be  released  from all claims
whatsoever by the  Contractor,  whether at law or in equity,
contract or tort or otherwise,  by reason of anything  based
upon,  arising out of or relating  to this  Contract,  other
than:

12
<PAGE>

(A)  claims  asserted  in  writing  on or  before  the Final
Payment is made;

(B)  claims  arising  from  circumstances,  acts  or  events
occurring after the Final Payment is made; and

(C)  claims that the  Contractor was not aware of, and could
not have been  aware of,  and that are based  solely on
the  willful   misconduct  or  gross  negligence  of  a
Purchaser Person; and

(ii) the  covenants  and   agreements  of  the  Purchaser   shall
terminate  and be of no further  force and effect except the
requirement of the Purchaser to return to the Contractor the
Contractor Bond at the expiration of the Warranty Period.

(e)  EFFECT OF PAYMENT.  No payment (final or otherwise) made under or
in connection with this Contract shall be conclusive  evidence of
the performance of the Work, or of this Contract,  in whole or in
part, and no such payment shall:

(i)  be construed to constitute  the  acceptance of any Defective
Work or Supplies containing Defects; or

(ii) release the  Contractor  from any of its  obligations  under
this Contract.

13.5. THE PURCHASER'S RIGHT TO WITHHOLD PAYMENT.

(a)  GENERALLY.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Purchaser  may
withhold  any  payment  or  other  amount  due to the  Contractor
hereunder  in an amount and to such extent as the  Purchaser  may
determine to be  reasonably  necessary  to protect the  Purchaser
from Loss or damage because of:

(i)    Defective  Work  not  remedied  in  accordance  with  this
Contract;

(ii)   Work that is not complete;

(iii)  the Contractor's failure to comply with any Warranty;

15
<PAGE>

(iv)   the Contractor's failure to perform the Work in accordance
with this Contract;

(v)    third-party  claims,  suits,  stop  notices,  attachments,
levies or Liens (other than  Purchaser  Liens) against the
System, the Work, the Supplies or any Party;

(vi)   Losses   or  other   damage  to  the   Purchaser   or  any
Subcontractor  that results from the Contractor's  failure
to obtain or maintain insurance required hereunder;

(vii)  the Contractor's  failure to provide on a timely basis the
documentation required under Section 13 hereof; or

(viii) reasonable  evidence  that  any  payment  previously  made
hereunder  (together with all other  previously  requested
amounts)  exceeds the amount  payable  with respect to the
Work actually performed.

(b)  THE PURCHASER'S APPLICATION OF FUNDS WITHHELD. The Purchaser may,
upon notice to the  Contractor  of its  intention to do so, apply
any funds  withheld or moneys to become due to the  Contractor to
satisfy,  discharge or secure the release of such claims that the
Contractor  has failed to settle  within  thirty  (30) Days after
notice by the Purchaser to the Contractor.  Any such  application
shall be deemed payment to the Contractor. Any additional expense
incurred by the Purchaser as a result of the Contractor's default
hereunder shall be deducted from the Contract Price. No action by
either Party during the above activities shall affect the Plan of
Work unless a Contract  Variation is agreed to by the  Purchaser.

Purchaser shall promptly pay the withheld amount with interest at
the rate set  forth in  paragraph  (c) from the due date  thereof
until the date of payment.

the  Contractor  shall release to the  Contractor  the Punch List
Reserve held by the  Purchaser in respect of such  incomplete  or
Defective Work.

13.6. OVERDUE PAYMENTS.  If a party shall fail to pay any undisputed  amount
within  thirty (30) days of the date such payment is due, the party to
whom such amount is owed shall have the right to charge  interest upon
such amount at a rate which is equal to the London  Interbank  Offered
Rate as published for such period in the Wall Street Journal,  Eastern
Edition.

SECTION 14. DEDUCTIONS FROM PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTOR

14.1. AMOUNTS PAYABLE.  To the  extent  that an  amount is not  withheld  in
respect thereof  pursuant to Section 13.5 hereof,  all Losses that the
Purchaser  shall have  incurred or sustained by reason of any act that
entitles the Purchaser to  indemnification  under this Contract or any
default or  omission  of the  Contractor  in the  performance  of this
Contract,  together with any sum or sums payable to the Purchaser,  as
Delay Damages or otherwise,  under this Contract, shall be paid by the
Contractor on or prior to the earlier of:

(a)  the  date  that  is  thirty  (30)  Days  after   receipt  of  the

(b)  the date the Final Payment is made.

14.2. DEDUCTION.  Should the Contractor  fail to make any  payment  required

then deduct the amount of the  requested  payment from any moneys that
are, or may become,  due to the Contractor or have been made available
by it under the  Contractor  Bond.  If the moneys so due or  deposited
shall be less than the amount so deductible,  the difference  shall be
treated as a debt by the Contractor to the Purchaser and shall be paid
by the  Contractor  to the  Purchaser  within seven (7) Days after the
Contractor's  receipt  of  the  Purchaser's  demand  therefor.  If the
Contractor  fails to make such payment  within such  period,  then the
amount of such  deficiency  may be recovered in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

14.3. CERTIFICATE.  A certificate signed by the Purchaser stating the amount
of the Losses,  costs,  charges,  expenses,  damages or other  amounts
referred to in this  Section 14 shall be prima  facie  evidence of the
matter stated.

SECTION 15. CONTRACTOR BOND

15.1. GENERALLY.  The  performance  of all of the  Contractor's  obligations
under this Contract shall be secured by a performance and payment bond
in substantially the form of Exhibit 3 hereto (the "CONTRACTOR BOND").
The Contractor  shall deliver the Contractor  Bond to the Purchaser no
later than five (5) Days after the date hereof.

15.2. FORM OF CONTRACTOR BOND. The Contractor Bond shall:

(a)  be issued and outstanding until the later to occur of (i) date of
expiration of all Warranty  Periods and (ii) the Final Acceptance
Date;

(b)  be in an amount  equal to not less than ten percent  (10%) of the
Contract  Price on any date up to and  including  the RFPA  Date,
whereupon  the  Contractor  shall  have the right to reduce  such

15.3. ISSUER REQUIREMENTS.  The Contractor Bond and all renewals, extensions
and  replacements  thereof  shall be issued by a bonding or  insurance
company  acceptable to the  Purchaser at the time of issuance.  If the
financial  condition of any such bonding or insurance company declines
to less than an A.M. Best rating of A-, the Contractor  shall,  at its
sole cost and expense,  within thirty (30) Days after any such decline
in rating,  replace the issuer of the  Contractor  Bond with an entity
acceptable to the Purchaser;  PROVIDED that if the Contractor  Bond is
provided by more than one bonding or  insurance  company and each such
company is jointly and severally liable thereunder, the highest rating
of any one of such companies shall be controlling.

15.4. RETURN OF CONTRACTOR  BOND.  The Purchaser shall return the Contractor
Bond to the Contractor after Final Acceptance.

SECTION 16. CONTRACT VARIATIONS

16.1. GENERALLY.  The Purchaser  may from time to time,  with the consent of
the Contractor  (which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or
delayed), direct by written order to the Contractor (each, a "CONTRACT
VARIATION")  that  changes be made,  within the general  scope of this
Contract, to drawings, designs,  specifications,  the method or manner
of  performance of the Work, the method of shipment and packing or the
time or place of delivery.  The Purchaser may, with the consent of the
Contractor  (which  consent  shall  not be  unreasonably  withheld  or
delayed),  by Contract  Variation,  require additional Work, reduce or
direct the omission of Work or suspend the Work pursuant to Section 23
hereof or, as appropriate,  extend the period of any General Warranty.
Subject to the  provisions  of this Section 16, the  Contractor  shall
comply with each such Contract Variation.  The total value of Contract
Variations  made  under this  Section 16 shall not exceed ten  percent
(10%) of the Initial Contract Price.

(a)  CONTRACTOR-PROPOSED VARIATIONS.

(i)   GENERALLY.  The Contractor may propose modifications to the
Work if it determines that such  modifications  will result
in  improved   manufacturing   processes   or   timeframes,
reductions  in  costs  or  maintenance   requirements,   or
improvements in the System's  technical  capabilities.  The


18
<PAGE>

Purchaser  shall in good  faith  consider  such  Contractor
proposals, and shall seek to implement the same where doing
so  would  not,  in the  Purchaser's  judgment,  impair  or
adversely  affect the System as delivered by the Contractor
or the Warranties.

(ii)  MARINE  ROUTE  SURVEY.  The  Contractor  may,  based on the
Marine Route Survey results,  propose  Contract  Variations
with  respect  to the  System  Route or the  types of Fiber
Optic  Cable to be used for the System,  and the  Purchaser
shall not  unreasonably  withhold  its  consent to any such
Contract Variation.

(iii) FISHERMEN COMPENSATION. The Contractor shall be entitled to
a Contract Variation to increase the Initial Contract Price
in  the  reasonable  amount  of  compensation  paid  by the
Contractor  to  fishermen  to remove  gear or fishing  nets
subject to the prior approval by the Purchaser.

(iv)  CHANGE  IN LAW.  The  Contractor  shall  be  entitled  to a
Contract  Variation to increase the Initial  Contract Price
in the  reasonable  amount of reasonable  additional  costs
incurred  by the  Contractor  because  of a Change  in Law,
subject to the prior approval of the Purchaser  which shall
not unreasonable be withheld.

(b)  PURCHASER-CAUSED  DELAY OR LOSS.  If (i) the negligent or willful
acts or omissions of the Purchaser shall cause any Loss or damage
to the  Site,  the  Work or the  System,  and (ii)  such  Loss or
damage, despite the Contractor's reasonable efforts in mitigation
thereof,  results in any  material  increase  in the cost or time
required  for  the  Contractor's  performance  of the  Work,  the
Contractor  shall be entitled to a Contract  Variation in respect
of the  most  appropriate,  as  determined  by the  Purchaser  in
consultation with the Contractor,  of the following terms of this
Contract:

(A)  the Plan of Work (including the Guaranteed RFPA Date); or

(B)  the Contract  Price (but only to the extent that such Losses
or increased costs are not recoverable  from the proceeds of
insurance  required  to  be  maintained  by  the  Contractor
hereunder); or

(C)  both the Plan of Work and the Contract Price.

16.2. AMENDMENT.  Each  Contract  Variation  shall be recorded by means of a
formal written amendment  executed by the Parties.  Subject to Section
16.6  hereof,  no  Contract  Variation  shall be  effective  until the
Parties execute such amendment.

19
<PAGE>

16.3. OTHER  ADJUSTMENTS.  No  claim  for  adjustment  in time or cost  with
respect to any change in the Work shall be made, recognized or acceded
to unless  such  change  has been made in  accordance  with a Contract
Variation issued in accordance with Sections 16.1 and 16.2 hereof. The
Purchaser shall not be liable for the cost of any additional  Supplies
or Work unless made pursuant to a Contract Variation. No claim for any
adjustment  pursuant to any Contract Variation shall be made after the
Final Payment is made. The Purchaser shall not unreasonably  refuse to
authorize  any Contract  Variation  issued in  accordance  with action
taken by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 23 hereof.

16.4. EFFECT OF CONTRACT VARIATIONS.  No Contract Variation shall vitiate or
invalidate  this  Contract.  A  Contract  Variation  may  result in an
increase, decrease or no change in the Contract Price, with any change
in the Contract Price effected  thereby  determined in accordance with
the valuation procedures set forth in Section 16.6 hereof.

16.5. PRICING.  Unless  otherwise  approved by the Purchaser,  the price for
each  Contract  Variation  shall  be  determined  as  provided  in the
relevant  provision of this Contract before the Contract  Variation is
authorized.

16.6. VALUATION. A Contract Variation shall be valued at the Scheduled Rates
to the extent that, in the reasonable  opinion of the  Purchaser,  the
Scheduled Rates are applicable to such Contract Variation. In the case
of a Contract  Variation to which no Scheduled Rate applies,  the rate
or price  payable for the Contract  Variation  shall be  determined by
agreement between the Parties, and the Contractor shall provide to the
Purchaser  all price detail and other  information  the  Purchaser may
require to determine  for this  purpose.  If the Parties are unable to
agree, at the request of the Purchaser,  the Contractor shall continue
to perform in accordance with the terms of this Contract,  as modified
by such Contract Variation, pending resolution of the matter.

16.7. NO DELAY. The Contractor shall,  unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by the Purchaser  (such  agreement not to be  unreasonably  withheld),
implement  all  Contract  Variations  within the time  allowed in this
Contract for  completion of the Work. In this respect,  the Contractor
shall develop all reasonable  work-around plans,  alternate sources or
any other means available in order to prevent delays.

16.8. OBSOLETE OR SURPLUS SUPPLIES. If the cost of Supplies made obsolete or
surplus  as a  result  of a  Contract  Variation  is  included  in the
Contractor's claim for adjustment,  the Purchaser shall have the right
to  prescribe  the  manner of  disposition  of such  Supplies  and the
Purchaser shall receive an equitable  credit arising from  disposition
of such Supplies.

17.1. TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  Without limiting Section 33 hereof, the Contractor
shall  provide  technical  support to the  Purchaser  and to undertake
repairs  and to  investigate  trend  faults  for  the  Purchaser  when
required,  at reasonable  cost, to ensure the successful  operation of
the System throughout the System Design Life. Furthermore,  during the

necessary for the maintenance of the System, all under reasonable
technical  and  commercial  conditions,  during the System Design
Life.  If  the  Contractor   cannot  supply  identical  units  or
components due to obsolescence,  then the spares and replacements
to be supplied shall be the equivalent of the original  parts. In
addition,  the  Contractor  shall  carry out as  practicable  any
adaptive  engineering  work  necessary  and provide all necessary
implementation documentation.

(b)  CESSATION  OF  MANUFACTURE.  If for  any  reason  the  Contractor
intends to cease  manufacturing  identical  parts and replacement
equipment,  the Contractor  shall inform the Purchaser by written
notice at least one (1) year before ceasing such  manufacture and
allow the  Purchaser  to order from the  Contractor  any required
spare parts or replacement equipment.

(c)  PRICING.  The Contractor  undertakes to provide such spare parts,
replacements and facilities:

(i)  if of its  own  manufacture,  at the  Scheduled  Rates,  but
varied in  accordance  with the price  variation  formula in
Section 17.3 hereof;

(ii) if not of its own manufacture,  at mutually agreed equitable
prices.

and  monitoring  of the Work on the  Contractor's  behalf,  and  shall
provide  the  Purchaser  with a  summary  of  such  Project  Manager's
background and relevant  experience.  The Project Manager shall act as
the  principal  point  of  contact  between  the  Contractor  and  the
Purchaser,  and shall  have  authority  to act and make  decisions  on
behalf of, and be  authorized  to bind by contract or  otherwise,  the
Contractor.  If the  Project  Manager  shall  resign or at any time be
unable to act, the Contractor shall immediately  designate a successor
by notice to the Purchaser.

25

20.2. THE  PURCHASER'S  REPRESENTATIVE.  The  Purchaser  shall  designate in
writing a system  manager  (the  "PURCHASER'S  REPRESENTATIVE")  to be
responsible  for  coordination  and  monitoring  of  the  Work  on the
Purchaser's behalf. The Purchaser's  Representative  shall provide the
interface with the Contractor on all technical and contractual matters
pertaining  hereto, and shall have authority to act and make decisions
on behalf of, and be authorized to bind by contract or otherwise,  the
Purchaser.  The  Purchaser's  Representative  shall  from time to time
authorize  in  writing  Persons  to carry  out  specific  tasks on the
Purchaser's behalf. The Purchase has authorized Bechtel  International
Inc. or an affiliate  ("Bechtel")  to act as a  Purchaser's  Inspector
hereunder.

SECTION 21. INSPECTION RIGHTS

21.1. GENERALLY.  The Purchaser  and its  designees  shall at all times have
access  to  the  Work  and  Supplies.  The  Contractor  shall  provide
appropriate facilities,  as described in the Technical  Specification,
for such  access and for the  purpose  of  inspection  and  testing in
accordance  with the  provisions  of the Technical  Requirements.  The
Purchaser and its designees shall be allowed  reasonable access to all
plants,  offices and Sites of the Contractor and its Subcontractors to
enable it to inspect the Work and  Supplies  and to monitor  progress.
The  Purchaser  and its  designees  shall have the right to  establish
resident representative(s) at the Contractor's and its Subcontractors'
plants and at all Sites,  and the  Contractor  and its  Subcontractors
shall,  at the  Purchaser's or its designee's  request,  make suitable
office space,  facilities  and shipboard  accommodation  available for
such  representative(s)  at the Contractor's  expense.  The Contractor
shall  include in all of its  Subcontracts  such  provisions as may be
necessary  to secure  such  rights on behalf of the  Purchaser  or its
designees.  The Purchaser's and its designee's  inspection  activities
may include:

(a)  an  audit of the  Contractor's  and its  Subcontractors'  quality
control  system and practices and their  application  to the Work
and   Supplies,    including   to   the   design,    manufacture,
transportation,   installation   and  testing  of  all  Supplies,
materials and components; and

(b)  inspection  of all  parts  of the  Supplies  and  Work to  ensure
compliance with the Technical Requirements.

21.2. COVERED WORK. If any portion of the Work should be covered contrary to
the  request  of or to  requirements  specifically  expressed  in this
Contract,  such Work must,  if required in writing by the Purchaser or
its designee,  be uncovered for its observation  and replaced,  at the
Contractor's  expense. If any other portion of the Work is covered and
the Purchaser or its designee had not specifically requested the


26
<PAGE>

opportunity  to inspect such Work prior to it being covered and it was
not covered  contrary to requirements  specifically  expressed in this
Contract, the Purchaser or its designee may request the opportunity to
inspect such Work and it shall be uncovered by the Contractor. If such
Work is found to be in  accordance  with  this  Contract,  the cost of
uncovering  and  recovering  shall,  by a Contract  Variation  made in
accordance with Section 16, be charged to the Purchaser.  If such Work
is found not to be in accordance  with this  Contract,  the Contractor
shall pay all costs of uncovering and recovering.

21.3. NO RELIEF.  No  inspection,  audit or  approval by or on behalf of the
Purchaser  or its designee in respect of any aspect of the Work or any
Supply shall  relieve the  Contractor  of any of its  responsibilities
under this Contract.

SECTION 22. DEFECTIVE WORK

If at any time before the Provisional  Acceptance  Date, the Purchaser
states that, in accordance with the Technical Requirements, any of the
Contractor's Work contains Defects,  or is otherwise not in accordance
with this Contract, the Purchaser or its designee may reject such Work
or Supplies, and the Purchaser shall have no liability with respect to
payment therefor, notwithstanding that:

(a)  satisfaction may previously have been expressed;

(b)  title to such Work or Supplies  may have passed to the  Purchaser
in accordance with Section 37 hereof;

(c)  such Work or Supplies may previously have been accepted; or

(d)  payment may have been made in respect of such Work or Supplies,

and  the  Contractor  shall  promptly  replace,  at its own  cost  and
expense,  the Defective Work or inferior  Supplies to the satisfaction
of the Purchaser.  If,  however,  the Work was not Defective Work, the
Contractor   shall  be  reimbursed   for  its   reasonable   costs  of
replacement.

SECTION 23. SUSPENSION OF WORK BY THE PURCHASER

23.1. GENERALLY.  Should the Purchaser  desire,  in its sole  discretion, to
suspend  the  whole or any part of the Work or  suspend  for a further
period  Work  already  suspended  pursuant  to this  Section  23,  the
Purchaser  shall notify the  Contractor,  indicating the period of the
proposed suspension or further suspension.  If the Contractor believes
that such suspension will result in additional  costs or delay for the
Contractor, the Contractor shall, within fourteen (14) Days after such
notice,  furnish an itemized  statement  of such  estimated  costs and
estimated  delays to the Purchaser's  Representative.  Upon receipt of
such itemized  statement (or if no such  statement is received  within
the stipulated fourteen 14-Day period), the Purchaser's Representative


27
<PAGE>

shall  either  confirm  or cancel the  proposal  to suspend or further
suspend the Work or further  question the  Contractor  on the basis of
such  itemized  statement.  Promptly  after the  Parties  agree on the
amount of such costs or any  extension of time,  they shall  execute a
Contract  Variation in respect  thereof in accordance  with Section 16
hereof.

(a)  LIMITATION ON THE PURCHASER'S RIGHT TO SUSPEND WORK. In the event
that the Purchaser shall,  pursuant to this Section 23.1, suspend
the Work in its entirety for (i) a period of six (6)  consecutive
months,  or  (ii)  periods  totaling  twelve  (12)  months,  such
suspension  shall, upon the expiry of such 6- or 12-month period,
as applicable,  constitute a Termination  for Convenience for all
purposes hereof.

23.2. THE CONTRACTOR'S  DUTIES UPON SUSPENSION.  During any such suspension,
the Contractor shall:

(a)  cease  performance  of the Work and  place no  further  orders or
Subcontracts relating to the suspended Work;

(b)  protect and care for all Work, Supplies and materials, in transit
to or from  the  System  or at  storage  areas  for  which  it is
responsible; and

(c)  give the Purchaser copies of all outstanding orders and contracts
for  Supplies,  materials  and  services and take any action with
respect to such orders and contracts as the Purchaser may direct.

23.3. THE CONTRACTOR'S  DUTIES AFTER SUSPENSION.  Upon the cessation of such
suspension, the Contractor shall resume performance of the Work within
a reasonable period after being directed to do so by the Purchaser.

SECTION 24. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE

24.1. TERMINATION.  The  Purchaser  may,  upon written  notice (a "NOTICE OF
TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE") to the Contractor at any time, terminate
this  Contract or  otherwise  terminate  the  Contractor's  employment
hereunder  as to either the whole or part of the Work (a  "TERMINATION
FOR  CONVENIENCE").  A Termination for  Convenience  shall not nullify
this Contract but shall operate to terminate the Contractor's right to
proceed  with  the  Work  and to  discharge  the  Purchaser  from  its
obligations under this Contract, except for the Purchaser's obligation
to pay  the  Termination  Payment  (Convenience).  A  Termination  for
Convenience  shall not relieve the  Contractor  from  liability  under
applicable  Law for damages for any failure or omission to perform any
portion of this Contract  prior to such  termination  or prejudice any
legal rights of the Purchaser or the Contractor,  whether those rights
arise under this Contract or otherwise.

24.2. TERMINATION  DATE. A Termination for  Convenience  shall be effective,
and this Contract shall be terminated,  when the Notice of Termination
for Convenience is delivered to the Contractor.

24.3. TERMINATION PAYMENT (CONVENIENCE).

(a)  AMOUNT.

(i)  FORMULA.  In the case of a Termination for Convenience,  the
Purchaser  shall  make  a  payment  to the  Contractor  (the
"TERMINATION  PAYMENT  (CONVENIENCE)")  to  reimburse  it as
follows:

(A)  the  Scheduled  Rate  for  completed   items  of  Work,
including  Supplies  manufactured  by or purchased from
any Subcontractor in respect of this Contract; and

(B)  in the case of  incomplete  Work,  an amount (the "COST
FOR  INCOMPLETE  WORK")  equal to the  total  costs and
expenses  incurred for each category of Work identified
on the Provisioning Schedule,  with the addition of the
individual   category's   gross   margin  to  the  cost
category.

Costs for which the  Contractor  has,  despite its best
efforts in mitigation  thereof,  become  legally liable
shall  be  considered  incurred  for  purposes  of this
Section 24.3.

(ii) LIMITATION.  Notwithstanding  the preceding  clause (i), the
Termination Payment  (Convenience),  taken together with all
other payments made to the  Contractor  under this Contract,
shall not exceed the sum of:

29
<PAGE>

(A)  the portion of the  Contract  Price  applicable  to the
portion  of  the  Work  that  has  been   completed  in
accordance   with   this   Contract;    plus   (without
duplication)

(B)  the Cost for Incomplete Work.

(b)  TERMINATION  CLAIM.  The  Contractor  shall  submit  to  the
Purchaser  a written  termination  claim  (the  "TERMINATION
CLAIM"). The Termination Claim shall set forth a calculation
of the  Termination  Payment  (Convenience)  and  all  other
relevant facts, and shall contain  supporting  documentation
in respect thereof. The Termination Claim shall be submitted
promptly, but in no event later than six (6) months from the
effective date of termination of this Contract.

(c)  REVIEW PERIOD.  Within ninety (90) Days after its receipt of
the  Termination  Claim  (the   "TERMINATION   CLAIM  REVIEW
PERIOD"),  the  Purchaser  shall  convey any  objections  or
requests for additional information it may have with respect
to   the   determination   of   the   Termination    Payment
(Convenience). The Contractor shall provide such information
to the  Purchaser as soon as  practicable.  If the Purchaser
objects to any portion of the  Termination  Claim,  it shall
notify the Contractor in writing,  not later than the end of
the  Termination  Claim  Review  Period,  of  each  item  it
believes  requires  adjustment and, for not more than thirty
(30) Days  thereafter,  the  Parties  shall  attempt in good
faith to resolve any differences.

(d)  ACCOUNTING  FIRM.  If the  Parties  are unable to so resolve
such differences within such time period, they shall, within
ten (10) Days, jointly submit the items in dispute to a "Big
Four" accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Contractor
and the Purchaser for resolution on an expedited  basis with
a  request  for a written  report  thereon  to be  submitted
within thirty (30) Days from such submittal.  If the Parties
cannot agree on the  determination of the accountant for the
purposes  hereof,  the  accountant  shall  be a  "Big  Four"
accounting firm designated by the mutual agreement of a "Big
Four" accounting firm designated by the Purchaser and a "Big
Four"   accounting   firm   designated  by  the  Contractor.
Adjustments to the Termination  Claim by the accountant,  if
any, shall be:

(i)   made in accordance with the criteria set forth in this
Section 24.3;

(ii)  set forth in its written report; and

(iii) final and  binding on the  Parties  in the  absence of
manifest error.

Judgment  may be  entered  thereon  in a court of  competent
jurisdiction.  The  accountant  shall have no  authority  to
change or alter the terms and  conditions of this  Contract.


30
<PAGE>

Such  determination  by the  accountant  shall  not  relieve
either Party from liability under applicable Law for damages
for breach of contract or  prejudice  any legal right of the
Parties,  whether  those rights arise under this Contract or
otherwise.  The Contractor shall provide the accountant with
access, under  confidentiality  conditions,  to all books of
account  and  records of the  Contractor  that relate to the
System  and  are  relevant  to  the   determination  of  the
Termination  Claim,  based on the criteria set forth in this
Section  24.3.  The  accountant  shall not be  permitted  to
disclose to the Purchaser the underlying  cost  information.
The fees and expenses incurred in connection with any review
by the accountant  pursuant to this Section 24.3(d) shall be
borne   one-half  by  the  Purchaser  and  one-half  by  the
Contractor.

an "Event of Default"):

(a)  the  Contractor  fails to  carry  out  engineering,  fabrication,

creditors,   or  any  proceeding   shall  be  instituted  by  the
Contractor  seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent,  or

adjustment,  protection,  relief or composition of the Contractor
or its debts under Law  relating  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or
reorganization  or  relief  or  the  appointment  of a  receiver,

substantial part of its property or the Contractor shall take any
corporate  action to authorize any of the actions set forth above
in this Section 25.1(e); or

otherwise    commenced    against    the    Contractor    seeking

in  any  certificate,   financial  statement  or  other  document
furnished  to the  Purchaser  by or on behalf  of the  Contractor

of the time made, confirmed or furnished;

then,  upon the  occurrence  of any Event of  Default  referred  to in
paragraph  (a),  (c), (j) or (k) of this Section  25.1,  the Purchaser
may,  by notice in  writing,  advise the  Contractor  of such Event of
Default and the  Contractor  shall have  fifteen  (15) Days to correct
such Event of Default to the  satisfaction of the Purchaser  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that,  if such  Event  of  Default  can not be cured in such
15-Day period through the diligent  efforts of Contractor,  but can be
cured in a longer period  without there  occurring any failure to meet
the Plan of Work, the Contractor shall have an additional  period, not
to exceed 45 Days so long as it shall  commence  the cure  during such
15-Day period and diligently pursue such cure. If the Contractor fails

(F)  exercise  any and all rights and  remedies  it may have
under  law  or  equity,   including   seeking  specific

of  completed  Work  accepted by the  Purchaser as of the date on

this Contract but shall operate to terminate the Contractor's right to
proceed  with  the  Work  and to  discharge  the  Purchaser  from  its

relieve the Contractor from liability under applicable Law for damages

time  as  title  to the  System  has  passed  in its  entirety  to the
Purchaser,  it shall remain solely responsible for the institution and
maintenance  of all such  usual  and  reasonable  precautions  for the
protection  of the  Sites,  the  System  and  any  Work,  and  for the
prevention  of danger or damage to all  persons or property on or near
the Sites.  Without  limiting the  generality  of the  foregoing,  the

<PAGE>

30.2. WASTE DISPOSAL.  The Contractor shall, at its own expense,  manage and
dispose of all waste  materials in strict  accordance  with applicable
Laws and  Codes  and  Standards,  and  shall  keep each Site free from
debris and waste  resulting  from the  performance of the Work and the
presence of the Contractor Persons at such Site. In the event that any
Contractor  Person  shall  discover  the  presence  of,  or cause  the
discharge of, any material of a hazardous  nature on or from any Site,
the  Contractor  shall  immediately  notify the  Purchaser,  and shall
instruct all Contractor  Persons to desist  immediately  from the Work
until further instruction from the Purchaser.

SECTION 31. PERFORMANCE TESTS

31.1. GENERALLY.

(a)  THE  CONTRACTOR'S   OBLIGATION  TO  CONDUCT   PERFORMANCE  TESTS.  The
Contractor  shall, at its own cost and expense,  conduct and repeat as
necessary the  Performance  Tests as required  hereunder in connection
with   Provisional   Acceptance   (and,  as   applicable,   Commercial
Acceptance)  and Final  Acceptance,  in accordance  with the Technical
Specification.

(b)  SAFETY.  If during any Performance Test, it is discovered that testing
cannot be  conducted  in a safe  manner in  accordance  with  industry
practice, such Performance Test shall be terminated and the Contractor
shall remedy the unsafe  condition,  whereupon such  Performance  Test
shall start over.

31.2. RIGHT OF WAIVER.  The Purchaser  may, but shall have no obligation to,
waive,  defer  or  reduce  any of  the  requirements  relating  to the
achievement of Provisional  Acceptance or Final Acceptance at any time
by written  notice to the  Contractor;  PROVIDED that the  Purchaser's
exercise of any rights hereunder shall apply only to such requirements
as the  Purchaser  may  specify  and  shall  in no event  relieve  the
Contractor of any requirements,  liability or other obligations not so
specified.

31.3. LONG-TERM  OBLIGATIONS.  Nothing in this  Section  31,  including  the
Purchaser's approvals, nor the issuance of a Certificate of Commercial

way  modify or alter the  Contractor's  obligations  with  respect  to
Warranties  hereunder.  Neither the  inspection,  approval or payment,
including the Final Payment, under this Contract shall:

(a)  be construed to be an acceptance of any Defective Work;

(b)  be an admission of the Contractor's  satisfactory  performance of
the Work; or

31.4. OPERATING REVENUES. Any and all revenues generated by the operation of
the System shall be solely for the account of the Purchaser.

SECTION 32. SYSTEM ACCEPTANCE

32.1. INITIAL SYSTEM  COMMISSIONING  REPORT.  The Contractor shall submit to
the Purchaser the Initial System  Commissioning Report with respect to
the System in  accordance  with the  Technical  Specification.  Within
thirty  (30) Days after its  receipt of the  relevant  Initial  System
Commissioning Report, the Purchaser shall:

(a)  issue a Certificate of Provisional  Acceptance in accordance with
Section 32.2 hereof; or

(b)  issue a Certificate of Commercial  Acceptance in accordance  with
Section 32.3 hereof; or

(c)  not accept the System in its existing condition and the terms and
provisions of Section 32.4 hereof shall apply.

32.2. PROVISIONAL ACCEPTANCE.

(a)  GENERALLY.  When,  in respect of the  System,  the  Purchaser  is
reasonably satisfied:

(i)   with the Initial System Commissioning Report;

(ii)  that the System has been  completed in accordance  with the
Technical  Requirements and any other  requirements of this
Contract;

(iii) that the System has achieved all requirements  contained in
the Technical  Specifications,  as of the RFPA Date, during
the Performance Tests;

(iv)  that the System is available for full commercial operation;
and

(v)   that all  requirements  of this  Contract  relating  to the
System  (including  all Technical  Requirements)  have been
fulfilled   and  all   required   documentation   has  been
completed,  in each case other  than those that do not,  by
the express terms hereof, have to be fulfilled or completed
on or prior to the RFPA Date,

the Purchaser  shall issue a  "CERTIFICATE  OF  PROVISIONAL
ACCEPTANCE" in accordance with the Technical  Specification
dated  the same  day as the  Initial  System  Commissioning
Report or bearing the date (the "RFPA Date") on which the


39
<PAGE>

above conditions for the System to be provisionally accepted
were  actually  met. The  following  shall occur on the RFPA
Date:

(A)  the System shall be deemed to be provisionally accepted
by the Purchaser; and

(B)  title to any part of the System that has not previously
passed and the risks  thereof  and  responsibility  for
routine  maintenance shall,  subject to Section 32.2(b)
hereof, vest in the Purchaser.


(b)  PUNCH LIST. The Certificate of Provisional Acceptance may, in the
Purchaser's sole  discretion,  be unqualified or may have annexed
to it a Punch List, which shall be compiled by the Purchaser,  of
any  outstanding  minor  deficiencies or items to be completed by
the  Contractor.  The Contractor  shall,  as soon as practicable,
remedy the  deficiencies  and complete the Work  indicated on all
such  listed  items  so as to  ensure  full  compliance  with the
requirements of this Contract.  Such  corrective  action shall be
taken  by  the  Contractor  at no  cost  to  the  Purchaser.  The
Contractor  shall continue to bear the risk with respect to these
items, as long as any such items are outstanding, notwithstanding
that title shall have passed to the Purchaser.

32.3. COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE.

(a)  GENERALLY.  If the  Purchaser  does not  issue a  Certificate  of
Provisional  Acceptance  because the System contains Defects that
would prevent the full  commercial  operation of the System,  but
nevertheless  the Purchaser has determined that the System or any
part thereof is suitable to be put into  commercial  service (the
System or such part,  the "RFCS  PORTION") and desires to put the
RFCS Portion into  commercial  service,  then the Purchaser shall
issue,  with the consent of the  Contractor  (which consent shall
not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed),  to the  Contractor a
"CERTIFICATE  OF  COMMERCIAL  ACCEPTANCE."  On the date that such
Certificate is issued:

(i)   the  Purchaser  shall be entitled  to  commence  commercial
service over the RFCS Portion;

(ii)  title to the RFCS Portion that has not  previously  passed,
and the  responsibility  for routine  maintenance  thereof,
shall be vested in the Purchaser; and

(iii) the risk  for the  RFCS  Portion  shall  be  vested  in the
Purchaser,  except that any risk attributable to the System
or part of the System that  requires  corrective  action by
the Contractor shall remain the sole  responsibility of the
Contractor.

40
<PAGE>

(b)  PUNCH LIST. The Certificate of Commercial  Acceptance  shall have
as an attachment a list of items requiring  corrective action and
items still to be provided. Such corrective action shall be taken
promptly and such items completed by the Contractor at no cost to
the Purchaser. When:

(i)   the outstanding corrective action has been taken;

(ii)  all outstanding items have been delivered and approved; and

(iii) the  conditions  described in Section 32.2 hereof have been
satisfied,

the   Purchaser   shall  issue  a  Certificate   of   Provisional
Acceptance.  Upon such issuance,  title and risk to the remainder
of the System shall pass to the Purchaser  and the  provisions of
Section 32.2(b) shall apply.

(c)  NO RELIEF. The issuance of a Certificate of Commercial Acceptance
shall in no way relieve the  Contractor  from its  obligation  to
provide  a  System   complying   with  the  technical  and  other
requirements   of  this   Contract   and,  in   particular,   any
deterioration  or  Defects in the System  occurring  or  becoming
known  between the date of issuance of such  Certificate  and the
date of issuance of a Certificate of Provisional Acceptance shall
be corrected at the sole expense of the Contractor.

32.4. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE PROVISIONAL OR COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE.  If neither a
Certificate of Provisional  Acceptance nor a Certificate of Commercial
Acceptance  is issued due to the  existence of Defects with respect to
the System or the Work, the Purchaser shall,  without prejudice to any
of its other rights and  remedies  under this  Contract,  issue a list
detailing  such Defects and advise the  Contractor of a period of time
in which such  Defects  shall be remedied to the  satisfaction  of the
Purchaser.  The  Contractor  shall issue an  additional  commissioning
report   similar  in  form  and   substance  to  the  Initial   System
Commissioning  Report to the Purchaser  after all actions  required to
remedy such Defects have been taken by the  Contractor and such report
shall be considered in accordance  with the provisions of Section 32.1
hereof.

32.5. FINAL  ACCEPTANCE.  The  Purchaser  shall  issue to the  Contractor  a
"CERTIFICATE OF FINAL  ACCEPTANCE" in respect of the System within ten
(10)  Days  after the date on which  all of the  following  conditions
have, in the Purchaser's judgment, been satisfied in full:

(a)  the Purchaser has issued a Certificate of Provisional Acceptance;

(b)  during the period since the RFPA Date:


41
<PAGE>

(i)   the System  has continuously  performed in  accordance with
the Technical   Requirements,   including   the   Technical
Specification;

(ii)  there has been no component failure; and

(iii) the  Contractor  fully  discharged  all of  its obligations
comprising the Work on the System;

(c)  the Warranty  Period  applicable to each  component of the System
has  expired and there are no Warranty  claims  outstanding  with
respect thereto;

(d)  any and all items on all Punch Lists  relating to the System have
been completed;

(e)  the Purchaser has received the  Certificate  of Payment and Final
Release;

(f)  the System has  achieved  during  the Final  Acceptance  Test and
conforms  with the  specifications  set  forth  in the  Technical
Specifications,  including the Design Life Performance Standards,
as of the Final Acceptance Date; and

(g)  the  Purchaser  has  received  such  other  documentation  as the
Purchaser or any Financing Party may have reasonably requested to
establish   the   Contractor's   satisfaction   in  full  of  its
obligations relating to the System.

SECTION 33. WARRANTIES

33.1. GENERAL WARRANTIES.

(a)  WARRANTIES.  Notwithstanding the System having been provisionally
accepted  by the  Purchaser  and without  prejudice  to any other
warranty  made  by  the  Contractor  hereunder,   the  Contractor
warrants  until  the  expiration  of the  Warrant  Period  to the
Purchaser  that  the  System  shall  (each  of the  following,  a
"GENERAL WARRANTY"):

(i)   be free from Defects in design, materials, construction and
workmanship;

(ii)  not  develop  any  pattern of failure or  degradation  that
would be  likely  to cause  the  System to fail to meet the
Design Life Performance Standards;

(iii) be fit for the  particular  use  described in the Technical
Specification; and

(iv)  meet   the   Technical   Specifications   and   all   other
requirements of this Contract.

42
<PAGE>

(b)  REPAIR GENERALLY.  If at any time within any applicable  Warranty
Period any  Defect  occurs in the System as a result of a failure
of a Warranty,

(i)  and  such  Defect  causes  the  System  to fail to meet  the
Technical  Specifications,  the  Contractor  shall  promptly
repair  or  replace  such  part  or  parts  thereof  to  the
satisfaction  of the  Purchaser  without  any  charge to the
Purchaser; or

(ii) while the System is meeting  the  Technical  Specifications,
the  Contractor  shall,  at the direction of the  Purchaser,
either:

(A)  replace any Defective Work immediately; or

[REDACTED]

PROVIDED that the Contractor  shall not be  responsible  for
any  cost  or  expense  relating  to  any  repair  cableship
necessary  for  installation,  de-installation  or otherwise
required to effect repairs of any Defect occurring after the
first two (2) years of the applicable  Warranty Period.  The
Contractor  shall make every  reasonable  effort to minimize
the period of time to repair or replace  any faulty  unit or
equipment and to deliver such unit or equipment, as repaired
or replaced, to the Purchaser.

(c)  REPLACEMENT ONLY. If during any applicable Warranty Period:



43
<PAGE>

(i)  based  on  analysis  pursuant  to  Section  33.1(g)  hereof,
related  or  substantially  similar  defects  are  found  on
repeated occasions in any part of the System; or

(ii) any other  pattern of failure or pattern of  degradation  is
likely to cause  any part of the  System to fail to meet the
Design Life  Performance  Guarantees  over the System Design
Life,

then, in either case, at the request of the Purchaser,  each such
part shall not be repaired but shall be replaced by a new part.

(d)  OUT OF SERVICE. The Contractor shall make every reasonable effort
to minimize  the period of time that the System is out of service
for repair and testing. For failures or any situations that cause
or risk an outage of the System,  the Contractor shall initiate a
corrective intervention  immediately after receipt of notice from
the Purchaser.

(e)  REPAIR BY THE PURCHASER.  Upon any breach of any General Warranty
of  the  Contractor  occurring  during  the  applicable  Warranty
Period,  the Purchaser may, to the extent that the Contractor has
failed to (i) make prompt repair or replacement, or (ii) minimize
System  out-of-service  time for testing and repair,  arrange for
the  repair  or   replacement  of  any  Defective  Work  and  the
Contractor  shall reimburse the Purchaser for the cost of repairs
or  replacements,  including the cost of  chartering  cableships,
remotely operated  vehicles and other repair equipment;  provided
that the  Contractor  shall  not be  responsible  for any cost or
expense relating to any repair  cableship or equipment  necessary
for installation, de-installation or otherwise required to effect
repairs of Defects occurring after the first two (2) years of the
applicable  Warranty Period. The Purchaser agrees to (i) give the
Contractor  prompt  notice of any such repair  undertaking,  (ii)
coordinate its repair  activities  with those of the  Contractor,
and (iii) comply with the Contractor's  repair policies delivered
to the Purchaser, and the Contractor shall be permitted to have a
representative  on board to observe  at-sea repairs to the extent
accommodation  is available and the repair ship's  sailing or the
repair  will  not  be  delayed.  The  Contractor  shall,  at  the
Purchaser's  option,  also repair or replace  any such  recovered
defective  part or parts and return  the same to the cable  depot
nominated by the Purchaser at the Contractor's expense in lieu of
reimbursement   for  the  use  of  the  Purchaser's   spares  for
replacement.  Any  repair by the  Purchaser  shall not in any way
diminish the Contractor's obligations under this Section 33.

(f)  REPAIRED OR  REPLACEMENT  PARTS.  Each defective part repaired or
replaced pursuant to this Section 33 (a "REPLACEMENT ITEM") shall
itself be subject to the provisions of this Section 33 (including
this  Section  33.1),  and  shall be  warranted  from the date of


44
<PAGE>

repair or replacement, as applicable, until a date five (5) years
thereafter;  provided that the Warranty Period  applicable to any
Replacement Item shall in no case exceed seven (7) years from the
RFPA Date.

(g)  INVESTIGATION. The Contractor shall investigate, at its sole cost
and expense,  any  defective  part or parts  repaired or replaced
pursuant  to this  Section  33 to  determine,  to the  reasonable
satisfaction  of the Purchaser,  the type of defect and the cause
of failure of the part or parts.  The Contractor  shall provide a
descriptive written report to the Purchaser on the results of the
investigation,  the type of defect found and,  when  appropriate,
the  repair  carried  out on such  defective  part or parts.  The
Contractor  shall also state  whether  the type of defect and the
cause of the  failure  are  expected  to occur  elsewhere  in the
System; PROVIDED that the Contractor's determination shall not be
conclusive for the purposes of Section 33.1(c) hereof.

(h)  THE  PURCHASER'S  EXPENSES.  The  Contractor  shall  pay  to  the
Purchaser  all the expenses (if any) incurred by the Purchaser in
testing or examining any part of the System for the purpose of or
in  connection  with  this  Section  33  or  in  or  about  or in
connection with the correction, replacement or repair of any part
of the System.

SECTION 34. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBCONTRACTING

34.1. GENERALLY. The Contractor shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser,  assign this Contract or Subcontract any part of the
Work, or assign, mortgage, charge or encumber any of the moneys due or
becoming due under this  Contract,  or any other benefit or obligation
whatsoever  arising,  or that  may  arise  under  this  Contract.  The
Contractor shall not be relieved of responsibility under this Contract
for such  parts  of the Work as are  assigned  or  Subcontracted.  The
Subcontractors as of the date hereof are set forth on Appendix 8.

34.2. SUBCONTRACTS.  The Contractor shall ensure that each Subcontract shall
contain:

(a)  provisions  allowing the Purchasers and its designees  reasonable
access  to all  plants,  offices  and  Sites in  accordance  with
Section 21 hereof;

(b)  provisions  stating that the  Subcontractor  shall have no rights
against the Purchaser  and shall not file any Lien  (equitable or
otherwise)  against the Purchaser,  the System or any of the Work
or Supplies; and

(c)  such other  provisions  of this  Contract as prudently  should be
made applicable to such  Subcontract or Subcontractor in order to
permit the  Contractor  to fulfill its  obligations  hereunder or
otherwise give full effect to the provisions of this Contract.


45
<PAGE>

34.3. EXISTING  SUBCONTRACTS.   The  Contractor  represents,   warrants  and
covenants that all  Subcontracts  entered into by the Contractor on or
prior to the date  hereof  contain,  or shall be amended  to  contain,
provisions addressing the matters set forth in Section 34.2 hereof.

34.4. BREACH.  If the Contractor  commits any breach of this Section 34, any
assignment,   mortgage,   charge,   encumbrance   or   Subcontract  in
contravention  of this Section 34 shall, as against the Purchaser,  be
null and void and of no force and  effect,  and may be  ignored by the
Purchaser.  The Contractor shall protect,  defend,  indemnify and keep
indemnified  the Purchaser  against all Losses suffered or incurred by
the Purchaser arising out of or related to such assignment,  mortgage,
charge, encumbrance or Subcontract.

34.5. SUBCONTRACTOR ASSIGNMENT. The Contractor shall make reasonable efforts
so that its Subcontracts include provisions  permitting the assignment
of that Subcontract to the Purchaser upon a Termination For Default or
Take Over.

SECTION 35. THE CONTRACTOR'S PERSONNEL

The Contractor shall employ,  and shall ensure that its Subcontractors
employ, for Work to be performed in connection with this Contract only
such persons who are careful,  suitably skilled and  experienced.  The
Purchaser, or its designee, may object to and direct the Contractor to
remove any person employed by the Contractor or any  Subcontractor and
such person shall be removed  within a  reasonable  period of time and
shall not be employed  again for any  portion of the Work  without the
prior approval of the Purchaser's Representative.

SECTION 36. THE PURCHASER'S STAFF

36.1. GENERALLY.  Where the Technical  Requirements  provide for  stipulated
Work to be carried  out by the  Purchaser,  such Work shall be carried
out in the manner and with the  responsibilities  as defined  therein.
Such  participation  by any of the  Purchaser's  staff  (or any  other
Person  designated  by the  Purchaser by contract or otherwise) in the
Work  shall  not be  construed  as  relieving  the  Contractor  of its
responsibility for the design, quality and performance of the System.

36.2. LIMITATIONS.  Where any of the Purchaser's staff (or any other Persons
designated by the Purchaser by contract or otherwise)  participate  in
the Work, they shall remain  officers,  partners,  employees or agents
and under the administrative control of the Purchaser.  The Contractor
shall not be liable for any  negligent  act or omission of such staff,
agents or designees,  but if in giving  instructions to be carried out
by any such  Persons,  or by omitting to give such  instructions,  the
Contractor fails to use proper skill and care, the Contractor shall be
deemed to have been negligent and shall be liable for the  consequence
of such negligence.

SECTION 37. TITLE

37.1. TITLE TO  SUPPLIES.  The  absolute  and  exclusive  right,  title  and
interest to each item of Supply  intended  for use in the System shall
vest in and be the absolute  property of the Purchaser from the moment
that the Contractor Invoice (together with all documentation  required
under Section 13.4 hereof) for the Progress Payment in respect of such
Supply is submitted to the  Purchaser and such  Contractor  Invoice is
paid by the Purchaser subject to the Purchaser's  rights under Section
13.5. The Contractor  represents and warrants that the Purchaser shall
at that time  acquire  good and clear title to such  Supply,  free and
clear of all  Liens.  When  held at any  Site,  such  Supply  shall be
identified as clearly as possible by the prominent  display of notices
and by marking as being the property of the Purchaser.  The Contractor
shall  ensure  that  the  relevant   books  of  account  are  suitably
annotated,  and shall allow the  Purchaser  access to the premises and
records in order to check that such  identification  has been  carried
out.

37.2. REMOVAL OF LIENS.  The Contractor shall secure the removal of any Lien
(other than  Purchaser  Liens) on the Work and Supplies  within thirty
(30) Days after  obtaining  notice  thereof.  If any Lien  (other than
Purchaser Liens) is not discharged,  satisfied or released within such
30 Days or such  earlier  time as may be  necessary  in order  for the
Purchaser to avoid being  damaged  thereby,  the  Purchaser  may, upon
notice to the  Contractor  of its  intention to do so, apply any funds
withheld  or moneys  to  become  due to the  Contractor  hereunder  to
satisfy, discharge or secure the release (including by posting a bond)
of such items.  Any such  application by the Purchaser shall be deemed
payment to the  Contractor.  Any  additional  expense  incurred by the
Purchaser as a result of the  Contractor's  breach of any provision of
this Section 37.2 shall be borne by the Contractor.

37.3. NO RELEASE OF THE CONTRACTOR.  The transfer of title shall not absolve
or release the Contractor from its  obligations and liabilities  under

legislation)  and other persons  employed by the Contractor in or
about or in connection  with the Work and the  performance of the
Contractor's  obligations  under this  Contract.  This  insurance
shall cover all employees and servants of the  Contractor for all

failure of any insurer  providing  insurance for the Contractor or any
Subcontractor,  or failure of any such insurer to pay claims accruing,

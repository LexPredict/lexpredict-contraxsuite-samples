Purchase Contract for the bulk sale of said Lots. All Sale Deposits shall be deposited and held in the Borrower’s Funds Account and shall be applied by Lender for the payment of the Obligations as provided in this Agreement. In the event that
any Bulk Lot Sale is terminated and any Sale Deposit previously paid to Lender is to be returned to a Non-Related Party pursuant to the terms of a Purchase Contract, then Borrower may include in its Draw Request funds to pay all or a portion of said
Sale Deposit to said Non-Related Party, provided there is no Event of Default and sufficient Loan funds are available under the Borrowing Availability.

outstanding principal balance of the Loan.

from the Borrowing Base shall not be available for use in calculating the Borrowing Base Availability, even if said Lot or Home is still encumbered by the Deed of Trust from and after the removal of said Lot or Home from the Borrowing Base.

2.2 Borrowing Availability Under the Borrowing Base. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.2, the
Borrowing Availability under the Borrowing Base shall be reasonably determined by Lender based on each Borrowing Base Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.4.4.
2.2.1 General Determination. The Borrowing Availability shall be determined by Lender based upon:
(a) Each Borrowing Base Certificate most recently submitted by Borrower from time to time (adjusted as reasonably determined by Lender from time to time to reflect portions of the Project sold,
property released from the Deed of Trust, and other adjustments and limitations pursuant to this Agreement);

(b) Lender’s inspections made pursuant to Sections 2.3.4 and 6.10 (as such inspections may result in any
adjustment to reflect any variance between (A) the Borrowing Base Certificate and (B) the result of such inspections or other information available to Lender); and




21	  	Construction Loan Agreement









(c) Such other information as Lender may reasonably require in order
to verify such amounts.
(d) Each Borrowing Base Certificate shall accurately reflect the valuation of
the Property included in the Borrowing Base as of the last day of the Calendar Month immediately preceding the Calendar Month in which such certificate is due and shall accurately calculate the Borrowing Availability as of the date of said
certificate. Without limiting the foregoing, each Borrowing Base Certificate shall exclude the Loan Allocations for any and all Lots and Homes that have been released from the Deed of Trust, and each Borrowing Base Certificate shall reflect any
reductions in the Loan Balance.
2.2.2 Right to Exclude/Adjust. Lender, in its reasonable discretion, may exclude
Lots or Homes from the Borrowing Base, adjust the Base Appraisal of such Lots or Homes, and/or adjust the applicable classification of property included in the Borrowing Base if:

(a) Such Lots or Homes are subject to unrepaired material damage or destruction;

(b) Lender reasonably determines that any Production Homes are to be removed from the Borrowing Base as provided
herein in order to comply with the Production Home Limitation requirements.;
(c) Lender reasonably
determines, based on the information provided by Borrower pursuant to Section 6.4, that reclassification of property included in the Borrowing Base is appropriate due to delays in development, changes in the Plans and Specifications, loss or
change of zoning or other Approvals and Permits, Borrower’s failure to satisfy applicable conditions for inclusion in the designated classification, or the occurrence of a Material Adverse Change;

(d) Lender reasonably determines that Spec Homes are to be removed from the Borrowing Base as provided herein in
order to comply with the Spec Home Limitation requirements.
(e) The exclusion of Lots and/or Homes from
the Borrowing Base shall not require Lender to release such property from the Deed of Trust, and Lender shall be obligated to release Collateral only pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2. Lender shall notify Borrower of any exclusion or
adjustment in the Borrowing Base in writing with the Lender’s calculations.
2.2.3 Specific Limitations.
Lender has no commitment to Advance Loan funds that would violate:

2.2.4 Intentionally Omitted.
2.2.5 Failure to Deliver
Borrowing Base Certificate. If Borrower fails to deliver a Borrowing Base Certificate as and when required, then in addition to Lender’s other rights and remedies, Lender may reasonably determine the amount of the Borrowing Base based
upon information available to Lender and such determination by Lender shall be final and conclusive, absent manifest error, unless and until Lender shall receive a new Borrowing Base Certificate determining the correct amount of the Borrowing Base.

2.3. Loan Advances; Project Monitoring.
2.3.1 Method for Advances. Advances in a sum not in excess at any time of the Borrowing Availability shall be made by Lender to the Central Account for the payment or reimbursement of
Permitted Expenses at the written request within ten (10) Business Days following Lender’s receipt of a completed Draw Request from Borrower (which may be delivered by telecopy or facsimile) by the Person or Persons designated from time to
time on Lender’s form of Authorization Form; provided, however, that Lender shall have acknowledged receipt of any changes in the Person or Persons designated by Borrower, and such Person or Persons shall have executed a new Authorization Form.
Such Person or Persons are hereby authorized by Borrower to request Advances and to direct the transfer of the proceeds of Advances to the Central Account until written notice of the revocation of such authority is received from Borrower by Lender
and Borrower has had a reasonable time to act upon such notice. Lender shall have no duty to monitor for Borrower or any other Person or to report to Borrower or such other Person the use of proceeds of Advances.

2.3.2 Use of Advances. All Advances shall be used to pay or reimburse the Permitted Expenses incurred by Borrower in
connection with the acquisition, development, marketing and operation of the Project and the other normal business activities of Borrower.
2.3.3 Draw Requests. Concurrently with a Draw Request for any Advance of Loan proceeds (other than Advances that, pursuant to this Agreement, may be made without a Draw Request), Borrower
shall furnish to Lender a Draw Request together with an updated Borrowing Base Certificate and such other forms and schedules of values as may from time to time be approved or reasonably required by Lender, duly signed and sworn to by Borrower, with
all blanks appropriately filled in. Borrower shall be entitled to submit no more than two (2) Draw Requests for each Calendar Month.

employ, at Borrower’s sole cost and expense as reasonably incurred by Lender, an inspector or inspectors and a construction consulting firm who shall review as Lender for Lender all construction activities reasonably undertaken in regard to the
Project. If reasonably required by Lender in its reasonable discretion, a certificate or indication from such inspector or inspectors that construction substantially complies with the Plans




23	  	Construction Loan Agreement










and Specifications shall be a further condition precedent to Lender’s approval of any Lots or Homes for inclusion within the calculation of the Borrowing Availability. Lender will allow a
maximum of five percent (5%) variance between the inspection report and actual Loan funds being requested by Borrower.

2.3.5 Limitations on Borrower’s Rights to Advances. Borrower shall be entitled to disbursements of Loan proceeds only
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (unless waived or modified by Lender); and, in addition, Borrower certifies in connection with any Advances requested hereunder that Loan:

(a) The representations and warranties of Borrower contained in all of the Loan Documents shall be correct in all
material respects on and as of the date of the disbursement as though made on and as of that date, and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the date of the disbursement;

(b) The requested Loan proceeds shall be applied by Borrower only to defray costs actually incurred by Borrower in
connection with the payment or reimbursement of Permitted Expenses; and
(c) Notwithstanding any
limitations on Advances set forth in this Agreement or otherwise, Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses arising in connection with the Project.
2.3.6 Excess Loan Balance Repayment. In the event the Borrowing Availability has a negative balance, there shall be due and payable from Borrower to Lender, and Borrower shall repay to
Lender an amount equal to said negative balance within the earlier of (a) three (3) Business Days after notice from Lender, or (b) five (5) Business Days after delivery of a Borrowing Base Certificate and/or other financial
reports of Borrower reflecting that such a payment is due.
2.3.7 Appraisals and Evaluations. Lender shall
have the right to order Appraisals, appraisal reviews and/or evaluations of the Land and/or Improvements for the Project included in the Borrowing Base, from a Qualified Appraiser, which Appraisal(s) shall comply with all federal and state standards
for appraisals and otherwise shall be satisfactory to Lender in all respects, if (i) Lender reasonably believes that a Material Adverse Change has occurred with respect to the Project or any portion thereof, (ii) Borrower requests in
writing that Lender order an appraisal of the Project, (iii) Lender is required to reappraise the Project in connection with regulatory requirements, or (iv) otherwise required by law. Borrower agrees to pay the cost and expense for all
appraisals, appraisal reviews and/or evaluations thereof ordered by Lender pursuant to this Section. Until the Loan is paid and performed in full, if for any reason a reappraisal of the Property shall indicate that the Borrowing Availability has a
negative balance, Borrower shall, upon demand by Lender, immediately prepay a part of the unpaid principal of the Loan sufficient to comply with the provisions of Section 2.3.6 above.

2.3.8 Borrower’s Accounts. Borrower shall establish and shall maintain the Borrower’s Funds Account if and when
required for the purposes set forth herein:
(a) Establishment of the Borrower’s Funds
Account. The Borrower’s Funds Account, if established for the purposes set forth herein, and all funds deposited and held therein shall be pledged as security for the Loan as provided herein. Only Lender shall have the authority to sign
documents and checks in connection with the transfer of funds into and out of the Borrower’s Funds Account.




24	  	Construction Loan Agreement









(b) Use of Borrower’s Funds Account and Central Account.
Borrower shall pay or be reimbursed only Permitted Expenses with the funds deposited into the Central Account. Advances shall be made directly to the Central Account. Borrower shall deposit or cause to be deposited into the Borrower’s Funds
Account any and all funds to be provided by Borrower to Lender during the Line Term, to the extent such funds are not paid directly to Lender pursuant to this Agreement. Following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default,
funds deposited and held in the Borrower’s Funds Account shall be applied by Lender to the payment of the Obligations as provided herein. In the event at any time during the Line Term the outstanding principal Loan Balance has been paid in
full, and excess funds remain in the Borrower’s Funds Account, such excess funds shall be used by Lender to make any Advances hereunder. Notwithstanding the existence of any funds in the Borrower’s Funds Account or the availability or the
non-availability of Loan funds under the Commitment, Borrower shall remain obligated to satisfy all Obligations.

(c) Central Account Provisions. Borrower shall establish and maintain the Central Account for
Project-related purposes as described herein and for Borrower’s other general business purposes. Although Lender shall have no security interest in the Central Account or the funds deposited therein, Borrower warrants and represents that during
the Line Term, all Loan funds deposited into the Central Account shall be applied only for the payment or reimbursement of Permitted Expenses for the Project or for other Project-related purposes as approved by Lender.

2.3.9 Project Cost Savings and Excess Costs. Each Draw Request submitted by Borrower shall be deemed a certification by
Borrower of the following matters:
(a) Excess Project Costs. In the event the actual cost
(“Actual Line Item Cost”) of any matter covered by any given line item in any Budget exceeds the amount allocated to such line item in said Budget (“Approved Line Item Cost”), Borrower either has (a) paid or
incurred the amount of the Actual Line Item Cost in excess of the Approved Line Item Cost (“Excess Cost”), or (b) the financial ability to pay such Excess Costs with its own funds, including without limitation the transfer of a
portion of any Contingency line item amount provided for in the Budget and/or any “Cost Savings” (as defined in Section 2.3.9(c) below) to such line item in an amount equal to such Excess Cost.

(b) Offsite Materials. In connection with any Project materials that are stored or housed at a location
other than the Property for the applicable Project (“Offsite Materials”):
(i) Borrower
has paid for the Offsite Materials or will cause payment to be made promptly upon receipt of the next Advance;

(ii) if the Offsite Materials are stored at the facilities of the supplier of the Offsite Materials
(“Offsite Supplier”), the Offsite Materials have been segregated from other materials in the Offsite Supplier’s storage facility and have been marked with the name of Borrower. If reasonably requested by Lender, Borrower shall
provide Lender with a written statement from the Offsite Supplier, which statement shall include the Offsite Supplier’s acknowledgment of (i) the right of Lender to enter the Offsite Supplier’s storage





25	  	Construction Loan Agreement









facility at reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting or removing the Offsite Materials
and (ii) Lender’s security interest in the Offsite Materials. If the Offsite Materials are stored in a place other than the facilities of the Offsite Supplier, if reasonably requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide Lender with a written
statement from the bailee or other custodian acknowledging (i) the right of Lender to enter the site where the Offsite Materials are stored at reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting or removing the Offsite Materials and
(ii) Lender’s security interest in the Offsite Materials;
(iii) Borrower has obtained
certificates of insurance showing the Offsite Materials to be insured as required by the Agreement and showing Lender as loss payee; and
(iv) Borrower has paid all personal property taxes applicable to the Offsite Materials. Lender shall have the right to inspect and approve the Offsite Materials.

(c) Cost Savings. For purposes of subsection (a) above, “Cost Savings” shall mean any
remaining undisbursed amounts shown in any Budget as allocated to any line item, or any funds allocated to said line item that exceed the amount of the subcontract for said line item either (a) upon completion of and disbursement for all
matters covered by said line item in such Budget, or (b) upon the execution by Borrower and an approved subcontractor of a subcontract for the performance of work or furnishing of materials for said line item in an amount that is less than the
Approved Line Item Cost for said item.
2.3.10 Net Construction Funds. In the event that, for any Home
constructed under this Borrowing Base, there is a deficiency in the “Net Construction Funds” available pursuant to the applicable Home Construction Budget (said shortfall shall be referred to as the “Net Construction Fund
Deficiency”), Borrower shall, upon ten (10) Business Days’ written notice from Lender, at Lender’s sole option and discretion, either (i) deposit with Lender the amount that Lender, in its sole opinion, deems necessary to
cure or correct said Net Construction Fund Deficiency for said Home, as applicable (which amount may be obtained from any excess Net Construction Funds available under an applicable Home Construction Budget), or (ii) furnish Lender with paid
invoices, bills and receipts indicating that Borrower has paid, from Borrower’s own funds, the amount that Lender, in its sole opinion, deems necessary to cure or correct said Net Construction Fund Deficiency for said Home, as applicable.
Borrower shall not be permitted, and Lender shall not be required, to apply any Net Construction Fund surplus to offset any Net Construction Fund Deficiency. All amounts deposited by Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.3.10 shall be held in the
Borrower’s Funds Account and shall be disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for the payment of Hard Costs and Soft Costs pursuant to the applicable Home Construction Budget prior to any further disbursements for said Home, as
applicable, in question.

2.5 Mechanics Lien Coverage for Each Advance. Borrower represents and warrants to Lender that Borrower shall provide to the
Title Company with all necessary information, including without limitation any indemnification or other agreements in form satisfactory to the Title Company, so that Lender receives the Title Policy which shall include a closing mechanic’s lien
endorsement (or substantially equivalent form of endorsement) showing the amount of insurance provided by said policy to be not less than the full amount of the Loan proceeds disbursed as of the Closing Date, which amount will be stated in the
endorsement and expressly providing coverage against unrecorded construction or mechanics’ liens arising from labor, services and materials provided prior to the Closing Date. In addition, and not by way of limitation, prior to any Advances
hereunder, Borrower shall be required to satisfy, as part of the conditions to Lender’s approval of any request for a Loan Advance submitted by Borrower, any and all requirements of the Title Company for the issuance by the Title Company of any
on-going/continuing mechanic’s lien endorsement acceptable to Lender to be attached to the Title Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, Borrower at all times shall be responsible to provide the Title
Company with any and all information required in order for the Title Company to issue the required mechanic’s lien coverage under the Title Insurance Policy, including without limitation any sworn statements by any contractor(s) and/or
subcontractor(s), unconditional lien waivers, owner’s affidavit, indemnification, and other information deemed necessary by the Title Company to determine that all potential lien claimants have been paid, will be paid from the Loan funds being
advanced, or that the Loan funds and/or Borrower’s funds are otherwise available to pay any potential lien claimants. Lender shall provide such reasonable cooperation as Lender deems reasonably appropriate in order to assist Borrower with
satisfying the Title Company’s requirements in connection with the issuance of any construction lien endorsement(s).


3.	THE COLLATERAL; RELEASE PROVISIONS.

certificate, or other document and all information prepared and delivered by Borrower to Lender in obtaining the Commitment is correct and complete in all material respects, and there are no omissions therefrom that result in such information being

was originally incurred to purchase or carry a margin stock or for any other purpose which might constitute this transaction a “purpose credit” within the meaning of such Regulation U or G. Borrower is not engaged in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing, or carrying margin stock. Neither Borrower nor any Person acting on behalf of Borrower has taken or will take any action which might cause any Loan Documents to violate Regulation U or G or any other
regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or any rule or regulation thereunder, in each case as now in effect or as the same may hereafter be in effect.

Lender of all of Borrower’s rights, title and interests in and to any and all Material Agreements as required by Lender in its reasonable discretion. No event has occurred which, immediately or upon the expiration of applicable cure or grace

(ii) any such contract, lease, permit, development agreement, covenant, restriction, option agreement, purchase and sale agreement, instruments and other agreement, (iii) any statute, ordinance, law, judgment, order, writ, injunction,
decree, or rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority or any determination or award of any arbitrator to which Borrower or the Project may be bound, or (iv) any other instrument, agreement or document by which Borrower or the Project is
bound.

limitation: (a) any attachment, levy, or other seizure by legal process or otherwise of any or all Collateral; (b) except for Permitted Exceptions, any Lien or Encumbrance or claim thereof on any or all Collateral; (c) any attempt to

claim questioning the legality, validity, binding nature, enforceability, or priority of the Deed of Trust. Borrower shall notify Lender promptly in writing of any of the foregoing and will provide such information with respect thereto as Lender may
from time to time request.
6.3.2 Further Assurances. Borrower shall promptly execute, acknowledge, and deliver
such additional agreements, documents, and instruments and do or cause to be done such other acts as Lender may reasonably request from time to time to better assure, preserve, protect, and perfect the interest of Lender in the Collateral and the

documents and information as Lender reasonably requires. Prior to the recordation of any plat or map by Borrower, Borrower shall deliver to Lender such title insurance endorsements insuring the continued priority of the Deed of Trust after recording
of the plat or map as Lender may reasonably require. Borrower agrees to take such steps as Lender may reasonably require in (i) either re-recording the Deed of Trust or amending the Deed of Trust to reflect the new plat legal description, and
(ii) obtaining an endorsement to the Title Policy to amend the legal description therein. In no event shall Borrower fail to record the final map for the Project later than 30 days following the Closing Date; if the final map is not approved by

the sole owner of all Plans and Specifications for the Improvements for the Project or, to the extent that Borrower is not the sole owner of such Plans and Specifications, Borrower shall have the exclusive right to use such Plans and Specifications

the exercise of Lender’s other rights and remedies, and Borrower shall obtain all consents and authorizations necessary for the use of such Plans and Specifications to Lender.

regulations of all Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction over the Project, and shall be contained wholly within the lot lines of the Land included within the Project and will not encroach on any other real estate, easements, building lines or
setback requirements. Within thirty (30) days after Borrower receives notice or knowledge thereof, Borrower shall proceed with diligence to correct any material departure from applicable plans and specifications and any departure from
applicable laws, rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Project. The making of Advances shall not constitute a waiver of Lender’s right to reasonably require compliance with this covenant with respect to
any such defect or departure from plans and specifications or applicable laws, rules and regulations.

rules and regulations.

connection with the approvals to be granted by Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents, but in no event less frequently than quarterly, Borrower shall provide such continuation endorsements, date down endorsements, survey endorsements and other

Permitted Exceptions. Borrower agrees to furnish to the Title Company such surveys and other documents and information as Lender or the Title Company may reasonably require for the Title Company to issue such endorsements.

6.3.9 Foundation Endorsements. Upon completion of the construction of the foundation for each Home, and as a condition
precedent to any further Loan disbursements under this Agreement, Borrower shall (if required by Lender), at Borrower’s own cost and expense, deliver or cause to be delivered to Lender a foundation endorsement with respect to each such
foundation, to be attached to the Title Insurance Policy referred to above, which endorsement shall insure that such foundation is within the boundary lines of each Lot comprising part of the Property, does not violate any applicable CC&Rs or
agreements affecting the Property which are referred to in the basic Title Insurance Policy, and does not encroach upon any easements, rights or rights of way affecting or covering the Property or any portion thereof.

in favor of, the inclusion of all or any part of the Collateral in any new improvement district, any “Mello Roos” district, special assessment district or similar district as long as the aggregate annual taxes, fees or charges
imposed by all such districts would exceed two percent (2.0%) of the gross sale price on any Home. Borrower shall give immediate notice to Lender of any notification or advice that Borrower may receive from any municipality or other third party
of any intent or proposal to include all or any part of the Collateral in an improvement, assessment or other district. Upon prior written notice to Borrower, Lender shall have the right to file a written objection to the inclusion of all or any

Authority or as a result of Lender’s rights under Section 2.3.7 above, Borrower agrees upon demand by Lender to pay to Lender the cost and expense incurred by Lender for such Appraisals and a fee prescribed by Lender for review of each
Appraisal by Lender.

understands and agrees that the inspection of the Improvements on behalf of Lender, the review by Lender or others acting on behalf of Lender of Draw Requests and related documents and information, the making of Advances by Lender, and any other

purposes and to verify any and all information included within any Draw Request submitted by Borrower hereunder. All inspections by Lender are for the sole purpose of protecting the security of Lender and are not to be construed as a representation
by Lender that there has been compliance with applicable plans and specifications, the applicable Requirements, or that the Project is free of defects in materials or workmanship. Borrower may make or cause to be made such other independent

occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default, such amounts required to be paid to Lender shall be applied (i) first to pay amounts due pursuant to Section 3.2.2, and (ii) then the balance shall be

money (endorsed, where required, so that such items may be collected by Lender). Any such proceeds which may be so received by Borrower will not be commingled with any other of Borrower’s funds or property, but will be held separate and apart

not change its name, fiscal year, or method of accounting without the consent of Lender (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Borrower will not directly engage in any business other than the lines of business in which
Borrower is engaged on the date of this Agreement, discontinue any existing lines of business that are material to the business or operations of Borrower, or substantially alter its method of doing business.

7.3 Change in Ownership. Any transfer prohibited under Section 2.9 of the Deed of Trust, shall constitute a breach
hereof.
7.4 Loans. Borrower will not directly or indirectly in relation to the Project (i) make any loan or
advance to any other Person other than purchase money loans made in the ordinary course of business and advances made in the ordinary course of constructing the infrastructure for said Project to Persons engaged in such construction, purchase or

any other person or any limited liability company interest or partnership interest in any other Person, (ii) make any capital contribution to any other Person, (iii) otherwise invest in or acquire any interest in any other Person or
establish any subsidiaries, (iv) guarantee or otherwise become obligated in respect of any indebtedness of any other Person, or (v) subordinate any claim against or obligation of any other Person to Borrower to any other indebtedness of
such Person.

Encumbrances securing this Loan, and (iii) involuntary Liens and Encumbrances being contested in good faith and through appropriate proceedings, and otherwise in accordance with the applicable conditions of the Loan Documents, Borrower shall
not grant or suffer to exist any Lien or Encumbrance upon any Property.
7.6 Indebtedness. Borrower shall not
assume, create, incur, or permit to exist any Debt for any Property, except (i) the Obligations, and (ii) any Other Debt expressly permitted under Section 6.15.1. Borrower shall not assume, create, incur, or permit to exist any

7.7 Acquisition of Assets. Borrower shall not acquire by purchase, lease or otherwise all or substantially all the assets of
any other person, if to do so would materially affect its business or operations.
7.8 Prohibited Drug Law
Activities. Borrower shall not enter into any lease, license, sublease, occupancy agreement or other agreement with any Person involving or relating to the use or occupancy of the Property (or any portion thereof) which would be a violation
of any state and/or federal laws relating to the use, sale, possession, cultivation and/or distribution of any controlled substances, including without limitation any Person engaged or intending to engage in activities (whether for commercial or
personal purposes) regulated under any California law or other applicable law relating to the medicinal use and/or distribution of marijuana (otherwise known as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996)





51	  	Construction Loan Agreement










(“Prohibited Drug Law Activities”). Every lease, license, sublease, occupancy agreement and/or other agreement involving or relating to the use or occupancy of the Property
entered into by Borrower during the term of the Loan shall expressly prohibit the tenant or other occupant of the Property (or any portion thereof) from engaging or permitting others to engage in any Prohibited Drug Law Activities. In the event that
Borrower becomes aware from any source that any tenant or other Person is or may be using, occupying and/or leasing the Property (or any portion thereof) with the intent to engage, and/or is engaged, in any Prohibited Drug Law Activities, Borrower
shall terminate its agreement with such Person and take all actions permitted under applicable law to discontinue such activities in or on the Property, and shall immediately notify Lender of Borrower’s notice regarding said Prohibited Drug Law
Activities and Borrower’s actions to terminate such activities. Borrower shall keep Lender advised of each action it takes or plans to take in compliance with the requirements of this Section 7.8.

Compliance with the covenants in this Section 7.8 is a material consideration and inducement to Lender in its agreement to make the
Loan to Borrower, and any failure of Borrower to comply with the foregoing requirements shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder. In addition, and not by way of limitation, Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless
from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability arising from or related to Borrower’s breach or violation of said covenants, including without limitation any seizure and forfeiture to the United States without compensation to Lender, free
and clear of Lender’s first lien security interest in and to the Property, or any action taken by the state or federal government to accomplish same. Borrower shall, within ten (10) Business Days following a request from Lender, provide
Lender with a written statement setting forth its efforts to comply with the provisions of this Section 7.8 and stating whether to Borrower’s knowledge any Prohibited Drug Law Activities are or may be on-going and/or have occurred in, on
or around the Property.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Borrower shall be personally
liable to Lender under the Loan Documents for any and all liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), claims, losses or damages incurred by Lender (including, without limitation, any impairment of
Lender’s security for the Loan) with respect to Borrower’s breach of, or failure to comply with, the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Section 7.8 relating to Prohibited Drug Law Activities, regardless of
whether such breach or failure results in the forfeiture, seizure, loss of all or any portion of the Property or Lender’s security interest therein.
7.9 Line of Credit Compliance. Borrower shall not be in default beyond the expiration of any notice and cure period as provided in that certain $235,000,000.00 term loan made by COLFIN WLH
Funding, LLC to Borrower pursuant to that certain amended and restated senior secured term loan agreement dated as of February 25, 2012 (as the same has and may be amended from time to time, “Borrower Term Loan”). Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that the credit worthiness and financial strength of Borrower is one of the grounds on which Lender approved and agreed to make the Loan, so any uncured default or event of default under the Borrower Term Loan may at
Lender’s sole discretion constitute an Event of Default hereunder.

occurred and Lender may draw or realize upon any bond or other security delivered to Lender in connection with the contest by Borrower, in order to make such payments.

that remain unpaid or that have not been discharged or stayed, exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) or would otherwise in Lender’s reasonable judgment constitute a Material Adverse Change on Borrower or any Project, and such judgment,

13.8 Incorporation of Preamble: Recitals and Exhibits. The preamble, recitals
and exhibits hereto are hereby incorporated into this Agreement.
13.9 Third-Party Consultants. Lender may hire
such third-party consultants as it deems necessary, the costs of which reasonably incurred by Lender shall be paid by Borrower, to provide the following services: (a) review final Plans and Specifications and final construction cost breakdown
and the construction schedule; (b) conduct compliance inspections with respect to the progress of construction of the Project and approve each element of a request for disbursement relating to construction costs, and (c) perform such other
services as may, from time to time, be reasonably required by Lender. This obligation on the part of Borrower shall survive the closing of the Loan and the repayment thereof as to any expenses reasonably incurred by consultants retained prior to
such repayment. Borrower hereby authorizes Lender, in its reasonable discretion, to pay such expenses, charges, costs and fees at any time by a disbursement of the Loan, and to the extent the applicable loan budget category is insufficient, such
expenses, charges, costs and fees reasonably incurred by Lender shall be paid by Borrower from its own funds.
13.10
Payment of Expenses. Borrower shall pay all taxes and assessments and all expenses, charges, costs and fees provided for in this Agreement or relating to the Loan or construction of the Improvements, including, without limitation, any
fees incurred for recording or filing any of the Loan Documents, title insurance premiums and charges, tax service contract fees, fees of any consultants, Lender’s processing and closing fees, reasonable fees and expenses of Lender’s
counsel, printing, photostatting and duplicating expenses, air freight charges, escrow fees, costs of surveys, premiums of hazard insurance policies and surety bonds and fees for any appraisal, appraisal review, market or feasibility study
reasonably required by Lender. Borrower hereby authorizes Lender to disburse the proceeds of the Loan to pay such expenses, charges, costs and fees notwithstanding that Borrower may not have requested a disbursement of such amount, provided that
Borrower acknowledges that Lender has no obligation to disburse amounts listed under “Borrower’s Equity” on the A&D Budget or the Home Construction Budget. Such disbursement shall be added to the outstanding principal
balance of the Note. The authorization hereby granted shall be irrevocable, and no further direction or authorization from Borrower shall be necessary for Lender to make such disbursements. However, the provision of this Section 13.10 shall not
prevent Borrower from paying such expense, charges, costs and fees from its own funds. All such expenses, charges, costs and fees shall be Borrower’s obligation regardless of whether or not Borrower has requested and met the conditions for a
disbursement of the Loan. The obligations on the part of Borrower under this Section 13.10 shall survive the closing of the Loan and the repayment thereof.
13.11 Disclaimer by Lender. Lender shall not be liable to any contractor, subcontractor, supplier, laborer, architect, engineer or any other party for services performed or materials
supplied in connection with the Project. Lender shall not be liable for any debts or claims accruing in favor of any such parties against Borrower or others or against the Property or the Project. Borrower is not and shall not be an Lender of Lender
for any purpose. Lender is not a joint venture partner with Borrower in any manner whatsoever. Prior to default by Borrower under this Agreement and the exercise of remedies granted herein, Lender shall not be deemed to be in privity of contract
with any contractor or provider of services to the Project, nor shall any payment of funds directly to a contractor, subcontractor or provider of services be deemed to create any third party beneficiary status or recognition of same by Lender.
Approvals granted by Lender for any matters covered under this Agreement shall be narrowly construed to cover only the parties and facts identified in any written approval or, if not in writing, such approvals shall be solely for the benefit of
Borrower.




58	  	Construction Loan Agreement

(b) By reason of the execution of the Loan Documents by Borrower or in performance of any act by Borrower which is

indebtedness arises at the Default Interest Rate of interest set forth in the Note (after giving effect to any notice and/or cure periods). Borrower’s duty to indemnify Lender shall survive the release and cancellation of the Loan obligations
and the release and reconveyance or any partial release or reconveyance of the Deed of Trust.
13.13 Titles and
Headings. The titles and headings of sections of this Agreement are intended for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

13.14 Brokers. Borrower and Lender represent to each other that neither of them knows of any brokerage commissions or
finders’ fee due or claimed with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby. Borrower and Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party from and against any and all loss, damage, liability and expense, including costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees, which such other party may incur or sustain by reason of or in connection with any misrepresentation by the indemnifying party with respect to the foregoing.

13.15 Change, Discharge, Termination or Waiver. No provision of this Agreement may be changed, discharged, terminated or
waived except in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the change, discharge, termination or waiver is sought. No failure on the part of Lender to exercise and no delay by Lender in exercising any right or remedy under the Loan
Documents or under the law shall operate as a waiver thereof.




59	  	Construction Loan Agreement









13.16 Choice of Law. This Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.
13.17 Disbursements in Excess of Loan Amount. In the event the total disbursements by Lender exceed the amount of the Loan, the total of all disbursements shall be secured by the Deed of
Trust. All other sums expended by Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been paid to Borrower and shall be secured by, among other things, the Deed of Trust.

13.18 Intentionally Omitted.
13.19 Time Is of the Essence. Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

exercising its rights or remedies created by, connected with or provided for in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and payment thereof shall be secured by the Deed of Trust. If at any time Borrower fails, refuses or neglects to do
any of the things herein provided to be done by Borrower, Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, to do the same but at the expense and for the account of Borrower. The amount of any moneys so expended or obligations so incurred by
Lender, together with interest thereon at the Default Interest Rate, shall be repaid to Lender forthwith upon written demand therefor and payment thereof shall be secured by the Deed of Trust.

13.21 Signs. Throughout the term of the Loan, Lender shall have the right to erect one sign on the Project (provided that
any such sign shall comply with applicable zoning and/or other property restrictions) indicating its provision of financing for the Project, and Lender shall also have the right to publicize its financing of the Project as Lender may deem
appropriate, all of which shall be reasonably acceptable to Borrower.
13.22 Subordination to Certain Easements,
Dedications and Restrictions. Lender agrees to subordinate the lien and charge of the Deed of Trust to any easements for any public utility purposes, drainage purposes or roadway purposes, or to any roadway park or common area dedication, as
specifically approved by Lender and as required by the applicable governmental authorities as a condition to its approval of the Final Map or the Condominium Documents. In addition, Lender agrees to subordinate the lien and charge of the Deed of
Trust to any CC&Rs which Borrower determines to be necessary or desirable in connection with the Project and which CC&Rs are approved by Lender. In addition, Lender shall cause the lien of the Deed of Trust to be partially reconveyed for any
portion of the Property approved by Lender which is required to be dedicated for roadway, park and common area purposes. Lender agrees, without receipt of further consideration but at the sole cost and expense of Borrower, to execute and acknowledge
any and all documents which are reasonably acceptable to Lender or are reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section 13.22.
13.23 Dispute Resolution. This section contains a jury waiver, arbitration clause, and a class action waiver. READ IT CAREFULLY.




60	  	Construction Loan Agreement









13.23.1 Jury Trial Waiver. As permitted by applicable law, you and we each
waive our respective rights to a trial before a jury in connection with any Dispute (as “Dispute” is hereinafter defined), and Disputes shall be resolved by a judge sitting without a jury. If a court determines that this
provision is not enforceable for any reason and at any time prior to trial of the Dispute, but not later than 30 days after entry of the order determining this provision is unenforceable, any party shall be entitled to move the court for an order
compelling arbitration and staying or dismissing such litigation pending arbitration (“Arbitration Order”).

13.23.2 Arbitration. If a claim, dispute, or controversy arises between us with respect to this Agreement, related
agreements, or any other agreement or business relationship between any of us whether or not related to the subject matter of this Agreement (all of the foregoing, a “Dispute”), and only if a jury trial waiver is not permitted
by applicable law or ruling by a court, any of us may require that the Dispute be resolved by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator at the request of any party. By agreeing to arbitrate a Dispute, you are giving up any right you may
have to a jury trial, as well as other rights you would have in court that are not available or are more limited in arbitration, such as the rights to discovery and to appeal.
Arbitration shall be commenced by filing a petition with, and in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules of, JAMS or National Arbitration Forum (“Administrator”) as selected by
the initiating party. If the parties agree, arbitration may be commenced by appointment of a licensed attorney who is selected by the parties and who agrees to conduct the arbitration without an Administrator. Disputes include matters relating to a
deposit account, application for or denial of credit, enforcement of any of the obligations we have to each other, compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, performance or services provided under any agreement by any party, including but
not limited to the validity, enforceability, meaning, or scope of this arbitration provision, and including a dispute based on or arising from an alleged tort or matters involving either of our employees, agents, affiliates, or assigns of a party.
However, Disputes do not include the validity, enforceability, meaning, or scope of this arbitration provision and such matters may be determined only by a court. If a third party is a party to a Dispute, we each will consent to including the third
party in the arbitration proceeding for resolving the Dispute with the third party. Venue for the arbitration proceeding shall be at a location determined by mutual agreement of the parties or, if no agreement, in the city and state where Lender or
Bank is headquartered.
After entry of an Arbitration Order, the non-moving party shall commence arbitration. The moving party
shall, at its discretion, also be entitled to commence arbitration but is under no obligation to do so, and the moving party shall not in any way be adversely prejudiced by electing not to commence arbitration. The arbitrator will (i) hear and
rule on appropriate dispositive motions for judgment on the pleadings, for failure to state a claim, or for full or partial summary judgment, (ii) will render a decision and any award applying applicable law, (iii) give effect to any
limitations period in determining any Dispute or defense, (iv) enforce the doctrines of compulsory counterclaim, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, if applicable, (v) with regard to motions and the arbitration hearing, apply rules of
evidence governing civil cases, and (vi) apply the law of the state specified in the agreement giving rise to the Dispute. Filing of a petition for arbitration shall not prevent any party from (i) seeking and obtaining from a court of
competent jurisdiction (notwithstanding ongoing arbitration) provisional or ancillary remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, property preservation orders, foreclosure, eviction, attachment, replevin, garnishment, and/or the
appointment of a receiver, (ii) pursuing non-judicial foreclosure, or (iii) availing itself of any self-help remedies such as setoff and repossession. The exercise of such rights shall not constitute a waiver of the right to submit any
Dispute to arbitration.




61	  	Construction Loan Agreement









Judgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction except
that, if the arbitration award exceeds $4,000,000, any party shall be entitled to a de novo appeal of the award before a panel of three arbitrators. To allow for such appeal, if the award (including Administrator, arbitrator, and attorney’s
fees and costs) exceeds $4,000,000, the arbitrator will issue a written, reasoned decision supporting the award, including a statement of authority and its application to the Dispute. A request for de novo appeal must be filed with the arbitrator
within 30 days following the date of the arbitration award; if such a request is not made within that time period, the arbitration decision shall become final and binding. On appeal, the arbitrators shall review the award de novo, meaning that they
shall reach their own findings of fact and conclusions of law rather than deferring in any manner to the original arbitrator. Appeal of an arbitration award shall be pursuant to the rules of the Administrator or, if Administrator has no such
rules, then the JAMS arbitration appellate rules shall apply.
Arbitration under this provision concerns a transaction
involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. The provisions of this arbitration provision shall survive any termination, amendment, or expiration of this Agreement. If the terms
of this provision vary from the Administrator’s rules, this arbitration provision shall control.
13.23.3 Class
Action Waiver. EACH PARTY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AS A CLASS ACTION, EITHER AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OR AS A REPRESENTATIVE, OR TO ACT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

13.23.4 Reliance. Each party (i) certifies that no one has represented to such party that the other party would not
seek to enforce jury and class action waivers in the event of suit, and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers, agreements, and certifications in
this section.
13.23.5 Continuing Lien. In addition to the “Obligations” (as defined in the Deed
of Trust), the indebtedness and performance of obligations secured by the liens and security interests granted in the Loan Documents include all indebtedness and all obligations of whatever kind or character, whether now owing, hereafter arising or
hereafter to be performed in connection with the construction of the Improvements, whether fixed or contingent, and including, without limitation: (i) those described in Sections 13.12 and 13.20 hereof, (ii) all indebtedness and
obligations arising under any agreements (“Assurance Agreements”) between Borrower or Lender and the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over any of the Project to assure the Governmental Authority that the Improvements will
be constructed in accordance with the Plans and Specifications and to the satisfaction of any Governmental Authority, and/or (iii) all indebtedness and obligations arising under any set aside letter or letters issued by Lender with respect to
the amount of the Loan available for certain construction costs of the Improvements, (collectively “Additional Obligations”). If, at the time the balance of the Loan is fully paid (“Pay–Off Date”), any of the
Additional Obligations remain to be paid or are subject to performance by Borrower, Lender or Lender’s affiliates, Lender shall not, notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in any of the Loan Instruments, be obligated to release that
portion of a Project remaining subject to the Deed of Trust given in connection with the Loan made for said Project (“Remaining Property”) as of the Pay–Off Date and the Remaining Property shall continue to secure the payment
and performance of the Additional Obligations then remaining subject to the Deed of Trust as of the Pay–Off Date.




62	  	Construction Loan Agreement









13.24 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns, except that Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights and obligations hereunder or any interest herein. Lender may, at its own cost, make assignments of or sell
participations in all or any part of the Loan made by it, to one or more lending institutions, subject to the consent of Lender and Borrower with respect to any assignee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Borrower,
provided that no consent of Borrower shall be required (A) if an Event of Default exists and is continuing, (B) in the case of an assignment by Lender to an Affiliate of Lender, (C) an assignment by Lender pursuant to a merger
or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Lender, or (D) in connection with any sale of a participation interest by Lender in the Loan to any lending institution. In the case of a participation, the participants shall only have the
participant rights in the agreement executed by Lender in favor of such participant relating thereto and shall not include any voting rights. All of the obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents of Lender selling a participation
shall remain unchanged and all amounts payable by Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents to any Federal Reserve Lender in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR Section 203.14
without notice to or consent of Borrower. No such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release the transferor Lender of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.
14. RECOURSE; EXCULPATION. The Loan shall be full recourse against Borrower. Notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Borrower’s liability
hereunder and under the Loan Documents is solely that of Borrower, and no personal or direct liability shall at any time be asserted or enforceable against its board of directors, officers, shareholders, employees or agents on account of or arising
out of any obligations arising out of or related to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (collectively, the “Non-Recourse Parties”). Neither Lender nor any of its successors, assigns, participants or transferees shall have any
recourse to any assets of a Non-Recourse Party.

acknowledges that such advances may be made by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion and without any request or authorization of Borrower. Any such Protective Advances shall be immediately due and payable and shall bear interest at the Default

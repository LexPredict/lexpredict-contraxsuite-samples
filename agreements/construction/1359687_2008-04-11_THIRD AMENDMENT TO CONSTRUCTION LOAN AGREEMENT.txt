EXHIBIT 10.38




THIRD
AMENDMENT TO CONSTRUCTION LOAN AGREEMENT



This Third Amendment to Construction Loan Agreement is dated as of the 15th day of
November, 2007, and is by and between RED TRAIL ENERGY, LLC, a North Dakota limited
liability company (“BORROWER”), and FIRST NATIONAL BANK
OF OMAHA
(“BANK”), a national banking association established at
Omaha, Nebraska.



WHEREAS, the BANK, and BORROWER executed a written Construction Loan Agreement dated as of December
16, 2005 (“AGREEMENT”).



Now,
Therefore, in consideration of the AGREEMENT, and, their  mutual promises made herein, BANK
and BORROWER agree as follows:





1.	 	Terms which are typed herein as all capitalized words and are not defined herein
shall have same meanings as when described in the AGREEMENT.

2.	 	Effective immediately, Section 6.23 of the AGREEMENT is amended to read:

6.2.3 The BORROWER shall determine, at each fiscal year end following
COMPLETION DATE, the amount of its EXCESS CASH FLOW for said fiscal
year, and at the time of delivery of the audited financial statements required by
6.1.1 of this AGREEMENT, pay to BANK, the lesser of (i) twenty percent (20%)
of such sum, or (ii) $4,000,000.00, to be applied to the outstanding principal
amount of VARIABLE RATE NOTE, and after VARIABLE RATE NOTE is
repaid, to LONG TERM REVOLVING NOTE to reduce the principal balance, if
any, and after LONG REVOLVING NOTE is repaid, BORROWER’s
payment to BANK of EXCESS CASH FLOW shall no longer be required. Such annual
payment shall not release BORROWER from making any payment of principal or
interest otherwise required by this AGREEMENT. No payment of EXCESS CASH FLOW
shall be the cause of a payment to BANK for interest rate breakage fees or
otherwise result in any prepayment fee.

3.	 	BORROWER certifies by its execution hereof that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5 of the AGREEMENT are true as of this date, and that no
EVENT OF DEFAULT under the AGREEMENT, and no event winch, with the giving of notice
or passage of time or both, would become such an EVENT OF DEFAULT, has occurred as of
this date.

4.	 	Except as amended hereby the parties ratify and confirm as
binding upon them all
of the terms of the AGREEMENT.

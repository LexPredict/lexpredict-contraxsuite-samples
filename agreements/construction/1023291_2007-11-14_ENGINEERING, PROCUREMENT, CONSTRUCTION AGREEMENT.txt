obligations hereunder Owner shall pay to Contractor a fixed price amount

($719,776,000) (the “Contract Price”), which is
divided into separately stated
contract prices for incorporated materials and for services and labor as
will be
set forth substantially in the form of Exhibit Q
within thirty (30) days of the
Full Notice to Proceed Date; provided that
such
amount is subject to adjustment as documented pursuant to a Change In Work
Form
with respect to the matters set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto (the
“Provisional Items”) and Exhibit I attached hereto
(the “Contingency Program”), and is exclusive of the sales and
use taxes to be paid by Owner pursuant to Section 5.4.  The Contract Price shall be
changed only as expressly set forth in this Agreement and shall be paid in
accordance with Article 6.



5.2           Cancellation
Cost Schedule and Payment Schedule.  Exhibit C sets
forth (i) the payments to be made upon completion of the Work or portions
thereof as set forth in such schedule, and (ii) the cancellation costs that
will be incurred if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 20.1; provided
that taxes to be paid by Owner and any bonuses earned and payable pursuant
to
the terms of this Agreement that are not included in such cancellation costs
shall remain obligations of Owner.



5.3           All
Items of Work Included.  The Contract Price will include payment
for:  (a) all costs of Equipment and Materials, temporary
equipment, labor, transportation, engineering, design and other services
relating to Contractor’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement and
the Work (including any intellectual property rights licensed under this
Agreement, expressly or by implication) provided by Contractor or its
Subcontractors; (b) all United States federal, state, regional, and local
taxes, goods and services taxes, sales taxes, use, ownership, value-added,
or
property taxes effective or enacted as of the date of execution of this
Agreement or thereafter, each as imposed on Contractor’s or its Subcontractors’

and
fuel taxes; (c) fees and contributions on or measured by the net income,
or
assets of Contractor or its Subcontractors, all employees wages or other
labor

foregoing related to the importation of any items into the United States)
imposed on Contractor or its Subcontractors with respect to any Equipment
and
Materials, labor, or services provided under this Agreement.  The

Project
Site, nor any corporate income taxes with respect to Owner’s profits, nor any
taxes to be paid by Owner as provided in Section 5.4.1.



5.4           Texas
Sales and Use Taxes.



5.4.1                      Separated
Contract.  Owner and Contractor agree that for Texas sales and use
tax purposes, this Agreement is a “separated contract” as such term is defined
in 34 Texas Administrative Code § 3.291(a)(12).  Sales and use taxes
on Equipment and Materials purchased by Owner from Contractor that constitute
Permanent Plant items shall be paid by Owner and are in addition to the Contract
Price.



5.4.2                      Texas
Direct Payment Permit and Other Matters.  Owner will provide
Contractor with a blanket Texas Direct Payment Exemption Certification covering
each sale, lease or rental of a “taxable item” (as defined below) by Contractor
to Owner in connection with the Work, which will negate Contractor’s obligation
to collect Texas sales and use taxes from Owner with respect to such taxable
items.  Contractor shall issue, and shall cause the applicable
Subcontractors to issue, properly completed Texas Resale Certificates and/or
other exemption certifications or other documentation, as appropriate, to
all
applicable Subcontractors, and shall take such other actions as are necessary
or
advisable, in order to claim, obtain and/or evidence that the sale of such
taxable items is exempt or otherwise not taxable for Texas sales and use
tax
purposes.  Owner shall have no liability to Contractor under this
Agreement or otherwise for any sales and use taxes paid, directly or indirectly,
by Contractor or any Subcontractor with respect to such taxable items, including
by reason of Contractor’s failure to comply, or to cause any Subcontractor to
comply, with the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise to avail itself
of
the benefit of any exemption it may receive, including the resale
exemption.  As used in this Section 5.4, the term “taxable item” has the meaning
assigned to that term in Section 151.010 of the Texas Tax Code.



5.4.3                      Certain
Reimbursements.  Contractor shall pay and
be responsible
for, and Owner shall reimburse Contractor (without duplication and which amount shall
be in addition
to the Contract Price) for,
all sales and use taxes imposed on (i)
Contractor’s services and overhead
related to the design, construction, or operation of the Project, but not
incorporated into the Project, (ii) all consumables
used in
connection with the Work which are not incorporated into the Project or for
which title has not transferred to Owner, and (iii) other indirect expenses
including any lease or rental of equipment or other property related to the
Work.  Such
reimbursable amounts shall be
included in Contractor's monthly Invoices and shall be paid pursuant to
Section 6.4.



5.4.4                      Statements
and Other Information.  Each Contractor’s Invoice shall be
accompanied by a separate statement for sales and use tax purposes which
shall
break down in detail the aggregate amount reflected on such Contractor’s Invoice
by clearly and separately listing and identifying each item (including any
service relating to the repair, remodeling, maintenance and/or restoration
of
tangible personal property and/or real property) and the amount of the charges
related thereto.  Contractor shall also provide Owner with any
additional information regarding each such Contractor’s Invoice and the
accompanying statement, and sales and use tax matters relating thereto,
requested by Owner.

5.4.5                      Cooperation.  Owner
and Contractor shall cooperate in good faith with each other, and shall use
their commercially reasonably efforts, to minimize sales and use taxes and
other
taxes relating to this Agreement and the Work, including taking advantage
of
applicable exemptions and consulting and cooperating in good faith with each
other in order to effectively handle and contest any audit, examination,
investigation, or administrative, court or other proceeding.  In
connection therewith, Contractor shall assign to Owner its rights to any
refund
of sales and/or use taxes which have been paid or reimbursed by Owner to
Contractor in order to enable Owner to contest the determination of taxability
and recover any overpayment of such taxes.  Contractor shall grant or
cause to be granted to, and shall cause its Affiliates, and Subcontractors
to
grant to, Owner or Owner’s representatives access at all reasonable times during
the course of the Work and for a period of six (6) years after the Final
Completion Date to all of the information, books, and records relating to
tax
matters (including sales and use tax matters) pertaining to the Work within
their possession or control (including, the right to take extracts therefrom
and
make copies thereof).  Contractor shall also furnish or cause to be
furnished to Owner or Owner’s representatives the assistance and cooperation of
personnel of Contractor, its Affiliates, and Subcontractors, as Owner may
reasonably request in connection which such tax matters.

5.5           Bonuses.



5.5.1                Schedule
Bonus.  Contractor shall be entitled to a bonus if Substantial
Completion is achieved prior to the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date
calculated as set forth in this Section 5.5.1 using the table set forth
below.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the bonus paid to Contractor
pursuant to this Section 5.5.1
shall in no event exceed *** Dollars ($***).  Subject to the foregoing
sentence, for each day prior to the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date
that
Substantial Completion is achieved, Contractor shall be entitled to receive
an
amount equal to the sum of the products of (A) the number of days in each
period
set forth in the following table, ending on the date on which Substantial
Completion occurs, multiplied by (B) the dollars per day corresponding to
such
period.





Number
of Days Prior to the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date that
Substantial Completion occurs:


Dollars
($) per Day



1
to 29


$***



30
to 75




$***

(for
each Day during such 30 to 75 day period but not
before)



76
to 136




$***

(for
each day during such 76 to 136 day period but not
before)



137
to 195

$***

(for
each day prior to the day which is the 195th day prior to the Substantial
Completion Guaranteed Date that Substantial Completion occurs,
but not
before)











As
an example only, if the Substantial Completion Date occurs 200 days prior
to the
Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date, such bonus would be equal
to:



(29
days x $***) + (46 days x $***) + (60 days x $***) +

(59
days x $***) + (6 days x $***) = $***

The
Parties agree that for purposes of this Section 5.5.1, Substantial Completion shall
be deemed
to have been achieved on the date of Contractor’s notice of Substantial
Completion that was accepted by Owner pursuant to an Owner’s Certificate of
Substantial Completion.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, in the event the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date is
adjusted to a later date from that set forth herein due to the occurrence
of one
or more events of Force Majeure or an Excusable Event caused by an event
of
Force Majeure affecting Owner, for the sole purpose of calculating the amount
of
bonus to be paid to Contractor pursuant to this Section 5.5.1, the number of days prior
to the
Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date on which Substantial Completion was
achieved shall be reduced by one-half (½) of the number of days by which the
Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date was so adjusted and the bonus that
Contractor would otherwise receive calculated using such adjusted number
of
days.  Owner shall consult with the Project Representative and
thereafter may agree, after such consultation, in Owner’s sole discretion, to
pay the bonus rates described above based on the Substantial Completion
Guaranteed Date using a number of days that is not adjusted as described
in the
preceding sentence for such events of Force Majeure or Excusable Events,
as
applicable.



5.5.2                Performance
Bonus.  Provided that Contractor has met the Minimum Performance
Criteria with respect to both the Net Capacity and Net Heat Rate, Contractor
shall be entitled to a bonus (i) if the Project achieves Net Capacity in
excess
of the Net Capacity Guarantee in an amount equal to *** Dollars ($***) per
kilowatt for each kilowatt by which the Project exceeds the Net Capacity
Guarantee, and (ii) if the Project achieves a Net Heat Rate below the Net
Heat
Rate Guarantee in an amount equal to ***Dollars ($***) per Btu/kilowatt for
each
Btu/kilowatt by which the Project achieves a Net Heat Rate lower than the
Net
Heat Rate Guarantee.



5.5.3                Payment
of Bonuses.  Owner shall pay any Schedule Bonus to Contractor
monthly within thirty (30) Days of receipt of Contractor’s invoice delivered
after the end of any calendar month during which such Schedule Bonus was
earned.  Each such Notice shall specify the amount of such Schedule
Bonus and shall include reasonable data and calculations on the basis of
which
such Schedule Bonus has been determined.  All Performance Bonuses will
be paid with the Final Payment.  Subject to achievement of the Minimum
Performance Criteria with respect to both the Net Capacity and Net Heat Rate
Minimum Performance Criteria, better than guaranteed performance for one
or more
of the Performance Guarantees may be used as a credit at the applicable
Performance Liquidated Damages rates provided in Article 15 to offset any Performance
Liquidated Damages
due hereunder; provided, however, any such better than guaranteed
performance utilized in the foregoing manner shall not thereafter be included
in
the calculation of any Performance Bonus.

6.           TERMS
OF PAYMENT



Payments
to Contractor shall be made as follows:



6.1           Monthly
Payments.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Owner shall
make progress payments to Contractor on a monthly basis in accordance with
the
Payment Schedule as set forth in Exhibit C.  Progress payments
as set forth in the Payment Schedule for work properly invoiced and encompassed
within the Project Progress Report submitted pursuant to Section 6.3 below shall be due and payable
on the
twenty-fifth (25th) day of
each
calendar month (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next Business
Day)
(except as otherwise provided in Section 5.5.3).  In the event that Contractor
fails to provide the Project Progress Report and pursuant to
Section 6.3 and Contractor’s
Invoice pursuant to Section 6.4
in any month by the fifth (5th) day of
such month,
Owner’s obligations to make the progress payment to Contractor for that month
shall be extended on a day for day basis.



6.2           Progress
Assessment.  Within five (5) Business Days of the issuance of each
Project Progress Report, representatives of Contractor and Owner shall review
the Work completed and assess the progress with respect to all of the Work
completed during the previous month and in the aggregate.



6.3           Progress
Reporting.  Following the date of this Agreement, Contractor shall
prepare a true and correct Project Progress Report and submit it to Owner
monthly within five (5) days after the end of the preceding
month.  Contractor’s submission of a Project Progress Report shall
include its representation that the Work described in the Milestone Summary
Schedule through the date of the Project Progress Report has, unless otherwise
stated by Contractor, been performed in accordance with this
Agreement.  In addition, Contractor shall keep, and furnish to Owner
at Owner’s request, such information as Owner may reasonably require to
determine that the Work is progressing according to the Milestone Summary
Schedule and the Project Schedule and for the purpose of confirming that
Monthly
Payments are due hereunder.  Contractor also shall keep daily logs at
the Project Site and shall provide to Owner weekly reports of actual
construction progress as compared with scheduled
progress.



6.4           Contractor’s
Invoices.  On or before the fifth (5th) day of each calendar month
after the date of this Agreement, Contractor shall submit a Contractor’s Invoice
in the form of Exhibit E to Owner for (i) the progress payment next due
from Owner in accordance with the Payment Schedule, (ii) any amount due for
Work
for which payment was withheld from an earlier progress payment in accordance
with Section 6.6, and (iii) any
other amount due Contractor pursuant to this Agreement.  Contractor
specifically agrees that it shall not request in any Contractor’s Invoice the
payment of any sum attributable to Work (a) for which Contractor has
already been paid or (b) for the portion of the Work which has been reasonably
disputed by Owner or Contractor (except to the extent such deficiency which
caused such dispute has been remedied).  Each Contractor’s Invoice
shall identify (x) the related payment set forth on the Payment Schedule
that is then due, (y) any other amounts then payable by Owner to Contractor
under Article 16 (without
limiting Owner’s right to dispute any amounts requested for payment), and (z)
any disputed payment amounts resolved and then due, and shall be accompanied
by
a






EXECUTION

Conditional
Waiver and Release Upon Progress Payment of Contractor for payments to be
made
pursuant to such Contractor’s Invoice.  In addition, with each
Contractor’s Invoice Contractor shall submit to Owner a Conditional Waiver and
Release Upon Progress Payment from each Major Subcontractor whose contract
or
contracts with Contractor or any of its Subcontractors require total payments
by
Contractor or such Subcontractor of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) or
more
(in the aggregate).  If any such Major Subcontractor has completed all
Work that such Major Subcontractor is to perform, Contractor shall also submit
a
Conditional Waiver and Release Upon Final Payment from such Major
Subcontractor.  Contractor understands and agrees that any
Contractor’s Invoice that is inaccurate or incomplete or that lacks reasonable
detail, specificity, or supporting documentation required by
Section 6.3, this
Section 6.4,
and, with respect
to a Contractor’s Invoice requesting the Final Payment, Section 6.8, shall not, to the extent
of such
deficiency, constitute a valid request for payment.



6.5           Owner
Review.  Without limiting Owner’s rights of review under
Article 11, Owner shall promptly
notify Contractor concerning any invoiced amount or portion thereof that
is in
dispute and of the basis for such dispute as soon as practicable after Owner
receives a Contractor’s Invoice and all accompanying documentation required by
Section 6.4.



6.6           Payments.



6.6.1                Monthly
Payments and Withholding.  Owner shall pay all amounts that are
then payable and not in dispute as set forth in the then current Contractor’s
Invoice (each, a “Monthly Payment”) as provided in
Section 6.1; provided,
however, that Owner may offset against such payment any amount then due
from Contractor to Owner pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement.  Such payment shall also be subject to withholdings by
Owner on the following basis:



(a)           Owner
determines that Contractor has not made satisfactory progress during the
previous month in accordance with the Milestone Summary Schedule.  In
such event Owner and Contractor shall reasonably estimate the shortfall in
the
value of Work completed from that which should have been completed in accordance
with the Milestone Summary Schedule provided that, if the Parties are unable
to
agree, the determination of any shortfall shall be determined pursuant to
Article 32;



(b)           Owner
withholds monies otherwise due by way of a refund of any earlier overpayments;
and



(c)           Contractor
has failed to pay Owner any sums or damages which are due and payable
(including, but not limited to, any undisputed Delay Liquidated Damages,
Performance Liquidated Damages or Reliability Liquidated Damages) within
the
time stipulated, or, if none is provided, within a reasonable time not to
exceed
fifteen (15) days, Owner has made demand (in the form of a Notice) in respect
of
any such sums and Contractor has failed to make such payment within ten (10)
days of such demand.



6.6.2                Payment
of Withheld Amounts.  In the event of any withholding as provided
above, Owner shall promptly deliver to Contractor, a Notice in accordance
with
Section 6.11.1 specifying the
determination and valuation of any uncompleted Work or the






EXECUTION
COPY







40

















details
of its reasoning if Sections 6.6.1(b) or (c)
apply.  Contractor may include
amounts withheld pursuant to Section 6.6.1 on subsequent Contractor’s Invoices when
and to the extent the uncompleted Work has been completed, the relevant
overpayment of monies has been refunded to Owner by Contractor, the outstanding
liquidated damages have been paid by Contractor to Owner, or the circumstances
leading to such withholding no longer apply, as
applicable.



6.6.3                Owner’s
Right to Offset.  Without prejudice to Owner’s foregoing rights
under this Section 6.6, Owner
may set off against any payment due to Contractor any amounts due and owing
from
Contractor to Owner arising from Contractor’s failure to cure a Contractor Event
of Default.



6.6.4                Payment;
Performance of the Work; Payment of Subcontractors.  Payment by
Owner hereunder shall not of itself constitute acceptance of Work or waiver
of
any Defect or deficiency therein.  Contractor shall continue to
perform the Work, notwithstanding a withholding or set off by Owner or a
dispute
over amounts due.  Owner shall in no event have any obligation to pay
any Subcontractor with respect to the Work completed by such Subcontractor
on
the Project.



6.6.5                TSA
Payments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.6, within five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof, Owner shall pay to Contractor (i) all
outstanding undisputed amounts invoiced under the Technical Services Agreement
dated January 25, 2006 (the “TSA”), as amended, between an
Affiliate of Owner and Contractor; and (ii) the payment identified on the
Payment Schedule related to the execution of this Agreement.



6.7           Retainage
Security.



6.7.1                Retainage
Security.  As security for the performance of Contractor’s
obligations hereunder, in lieu of any retainage, and within five (5) Business
Days after the Limited Notice to Proceed Date, Contractor shall deliver a
letter
of credit in an amount equal to $5,000,000, issued by a financial institution
that has senior unsecured debt rated at least A by Standard & Poor’s or A2
by Moody’s (or an equivalent rating from such other equivalent rating agency as
may be approved by Owner); and otherwise in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Owner (the “Retainage Security”).  The
amount of Retainage Security shall be increased immediately prior to the
expiration of each calendar quarter in an amount equal to the ten (10%) of
the
aggregate amount of the Contract Price to be paid by Owner to Contractor
in
accordance with the Payment Schedule as of the expiration of the following
calendar quarter.  Such Retainage Security shall remain in full force
and effect until released pursuant to Section 6.7.3.



6.7.2                Draws
on Retainage Security.  Owner may draw on the Retainage Security
from time to time in whole or in part on demand:



(a)           in
accordance with Article 29;



(b)           if
a Contractor Event of Default has occurred hereunder;






EXECUTION
COPY







41

















(c)
in an amount necessary to compensate Owner for amounts not received due to
Contractor’s failure to pay Owner any sums or damages that are validly due and
payable within the time stipulated, or, if none is provided, within a reasonable
time not to exceed thirty (30) days, pursuant to this Agreement (provided
Owner has provided a Notice to Contractor that such amount is due and owing,
and
Contractor has failed to pay such amount within ten (10) days thereof) after
receipt of such Notice including but not limited to any undisputed Performance
Liquidated Damages, Reliability Liquidated Damages or Delay Liquidated
Damages;



(d)           in
full if the Retainage Security is due to expire within thirty (30) days,
Final
Completion has not occurred, and Contractor has not, if applicable, replaced
or
extended such Retainage Security; or



(e)           in
accordance with Section 14.1.3.



Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any drawdown under the Retainage Security shall also comply
with
the following requirements;



(x)           the
amount requested in such drawdown, when added to the amount of all previous
draws under the Retainage Security (and its replacement, if applicable),
shall
not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total of amounts actually paid (or withheld)
by Owner to Contractor under the Agreement as of such date; provided
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if Contractor has failed to obtain the
release of any lien filed against any of Owner’s property, the Project Site or
Owner’s interest therein and Owner is entitled to draw on the Retainage Security
pursuant to Article 29, Owner may
draw the amount required to obtain the release of such lien, including amounts
to reimburse Owner’s costs incurred in relation thereto, up to the full amount
of the Retainage Security;



(y)           the
amount being claimed in respect to any of the above circumstances does not
exceed Owner’s good faith estimate of the amount that Owner is entitled to
recover from Contractor under the Agreement; and



(z)           Owner
shall not be permitted to drawdown on the Retainage Security after a termination
of this Agreement by Contractor solely by reason of an Owner Event of Default
(as determined pursuant to the procedures of Article 32); except to discharge any
Contractor Lien or
other charges which, if unpaid, might be or become a Contractor Lien pursuant
to
Section 6.7.3.



Nothing
in this Section 6.7.2 shall
prohibit Owner from drawing on the Retainage Security for any amount for
which
Contractor has provided its prior written consent.



6.7.3                Release
of Retainage Security.  By no later than the date which is eighty
(80) days after the Substantial Completion Date, the amount of the Retainage
Security shall be reduced to an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of
the
Contract Price (as the same may be adjusted pursuant to the terms
hereof).  By no later than the date which is the later to occur of
(a) the date which is eighty (80) days after Final Payment; and
(b) ten (10) days after the later to occur of (i) the date when Owner
and Contractor have settled upon the final Performance Liquidated Damages
and
the final Reliability Liquidated Damages, if any, that Contractor is obligated
to pay to Owner hereunder; and (ii) the date that Contractor actually pays
all such

Major Subcontractor shall have delivered Unconditional Waivers and Releases
Upon
Final Payment to Owner prior to such release of the Retainage Security or

preceding sentence, in the event this Agreement is terminated prior to
completion of the Work by Contractor as a result of an Owner Event of Default
in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Retainage Security shall be promptly
returned to Contractor; provided, however, all or some portion of
the Retainage Security in an amount equal to the aggregate amount represented
by
the Conditional Waivers and Releases Upon Progress Payment provided by
Contractor in conjunction with the most recent invoice prior to such Owner
Event
of Default shall be placed into a lockbox account with a recognized national
savings association pursuant to a lockbox agreement reasonably acceptable
to
Owner and Contractor, which shall provide, in pertinent part, that the Retainage
Security shall be released (a) to Owner, if Contractor does not promptly,
and in
any event within ten (10) days after receipt of Notice of a Contractor Lien
relating to Work performed by any Subcontractor for which Contractor has
been
paid, satisfy such Contractor Lien, or contest such Contractor Lien in
accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of Article 29, or (b) to Contractor upon
eighty (80) days

6.7.4                Interest
on Excess Drawings.  In
the event Owner has drawn under the
Retainage Security, the Performance Assurance, or the security as provided
in
Section 14.4(m),
and it is subsequently determined that
such drawdown was in excess of Owner’s rights hereunder, Owner shall return such
excess amount to Contractor within ten (10) Business Days of such final
determination with interest at the Contract Interest Rate from such drawdown
until return of such excess amount.



6.8           Final
Payment.  Upon the delivery of Owner’s Certificate of Final
Completion, Contractor shall submit a final Contractor’s Invoice (the
“Final Contractor’s Invoice”) which shall set forth all amounts
due to Contractor that remain unpaid (including amounts relating to the items
on
the Punchlist).  Upon approval thereof by Owner, Owner shall pay to
Contractor the amount due under such Final Contractor’s Invoice (“Final
Payment”).  Owner shall make Final Payment to Contractor
within thirty (30) days after receipt of both the Final Contractor’s
Invoice and Contractor’s delivery of the following items to Owner:



(a)           with
respect to each Major Subcontractor, a Conditional Waiver and Release Upon
Final

Conditional Waiver and Release Upon Final Payment; and



(ii)           an
Unconditional Waiver and Release Upon Final Payment no later than five (5)
Business Days after Contractor’s receipt of Final Payment.



6.9           Method
of Payment.  All payments to be made to Contractor under this
Agreement shall be paid in Dollars and shall be wire transferred in immediately
available funds on the date due or, if such date is not a Business Day, on
the
immediately succeeding Business Day to such account as may be designated

Contractor from time to time by Notice to Owner in accordance with
Article 30.



6.10           Disputes.  Failure
by Owner to pay any amount reasonably in dispute that is identified in
accordance with Section 6.5
until resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Agreement shall
not
alleviate, diminish, modify nor excuse the performance of, Contractor’s
obligations to perform hereunder in any respect, including Contractor’s
obligation to meet the Project Guaranteed Dates.  Contractor’s
acceptance of any payment shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of amounts
that are then in dispute.  Contractor and Owner shall use their
reasonable efforts to resolve all disputed amounts reasonably expeditiously
and
in accordance with the provisions of Article 32.  No payment made hereunder shall
be construed to be acceptance or approval of that part of the Work to which
such
payment relates or to relieve Contractor of any of its obligations
hereunder.



6.11           Holdbacks.



6.11.1                Owner
Holdbacks.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
addition to the Retainage Security, upon the occurrence and continuance of
any
of the following events, Owner, upon Notice to Contractor in accordance with
Section 6.11.2, may withhold or
retain such portion (including all) of any payment due to Contractor under
this
Agreement as Owner deems appropriate in Owner’s reasonable discretion to ensure
the performance of the Work or to protect fully the rights of Owner hereunder
(provided that amounts drawn down on Retainage Security or heldback pursuant
to
this Section 6.11 for any one
event or occurrence may not exceed the total amount of the
obligation):



(a)           in
accordance with Section 6.6.1;

accordance with Article 29;



(c)           in
accordance with Section 14.1.3;

(f)           As
one or more of the following shall occur:



(i)           A
Contractor Event of Default shall have occurred hereunder;



(ii)           Contractor’s
failure to increase the Retainage Security pursuant to Section 6.7.1;



(iii)           Contractor
shall have failed to deliver any Contractor Deliverable in accordance with
the
requirements of the Contractor Submittals Table to Owner on or before the
date
required, or any such Contractor Deliverable shall not have been prepared
by
Contractor in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement;



(iv)           Owner
shall have determined that any portion of the Work (but not including Work
that
Contractor is in the process of completing or is undertaking reperformance,
repair or replacement with respect thereto) for which payment has already
been
made pursuant to a previous Contractor’s Invoice shall contain one or more
Defects; provided that the amount so withheld shall not exceed the amount
reasonably expected to correct such Defect; or



(v)           a
third-party claim has been filed for which Contractor is obligated to indemnify
Owner pursuant to any of the provisions of Section 23.1 and Contractor has failed
to provide the
indemnification for such claim in accordance with Section 23.4.



6.11.2                Notice
of Withholding; Notice of Correction.  If, pursuant to
Section 6.11.2, Owner intends to
withhold any amount from a payment to be made to Contractor, Owner shall,
on or
before the date that the applicable payment is due to Contractor hereunder,
provide a Notice of Withholding to Contractor of any amount that will be
so
withheld.  Such Notice of Withholding delivered pursuant to this
Section 6.11.2 shall identify
the amount that will be withheld from Contractor, give a reasonably detailed
explanation of the reason Owner will withhold such amount, and shall be signed
by an authorized agent of Owner.  If Contractor receives a Notice of
Withholding from Owner pursuant to this Section 6.11.2, Contractor may provide a
Notice of
Correction to Owner of a condition described in such Notice of Withholding
delivered pursuant to this Section 6.11.2.  Such Notice of Correction
shall be sufficient to identify the scope and manner of the Corrective Actions
to be taken and the condition, and shall be signed by an authorized
representative of Contractor.



6.11.3                Payment
Following Notice of Correction.  If Owner receives a Notice of
Correction describing the actions taken to correct any condition described
in a
Notice of Withholding delivered pursuant to Section 6.11.2, Owner shall pay the amount
withheld by
Owner for that condition on the date the next payment is due Contractor
hereunder, or object to the scope and manner of the correction of the condition,
on or before the date the next payment is due to Contractor, in a written
statement that sets forth the reason for the objection and otherwise complies
with the provisions of Section 6.11.2.  If Owner objects to the
scope and manner of the Corrective Actions to be taken with respect to a
condition, Owner shall pay to Contractor, along with payment made pursuant
to
Contractor’s next payment request, the amount withheld for the correction of
conditions to which Owner no longer objects.

6.11.4                Limitation
on Contractor’s Rights.  Notwithstanding the provisions of
Sections 19.5 and 32.3,
Contractor shall not have any rights of
termination or suspension under Section 19.5 as a result of Owner’s good faith exercise
or attempted exercise of its rights under this Section 6.11.



6.12           Application
of Monies.  Contractor shall use the sums paid to it pursuant to
this Article 6 for the purpose
of performing the Work and designing, furnishing, equipping, testing and
commissioning the Project in accordance with the Scope Book and this Agreement,
including payment of the Subcontractors.  No provision hereof shall be
construed, however, to require Owner or any Financing Entity to see to the
proper disposition or application of the monies so paid to
Contractor.



6.13           Release
of Liability.  Acceptance by Contractor of the Final Payment shall
constitute a release by Contractor of Owner, their respective Affiliates,
the
Financing Entities, if any, and every officer and agent thereof from all
liens
(whether statutory or otherwise and including mechanics’ or suppliers’ liens),
claims and liability hereunder with respect to any Work performed or furnished
in connection with this Agreement, or for any act or omission of Owner or
of any
person relating to or affecting this Agreement, except claims for which
Contractor has delivered a Notice of dispute to Owner.  Nothing herein
shall constitute a release by Contractor of claims or liability of which
Contractor does not have actual knowledge as of the date of submittal of
the
Final Contractor’s Invoice.  For purposes of this
Section 6.13 only, Contractor
shall be deemed to have actual knowledge of any claim or liability if Contractor
would have discovered such claim or liability after conducting a reasonable
investigation prior to submittal of the Final Contractor’s Invoice.



6.14           Contract
Interest Rate.  Overdue payment obligations of the Owner and the
Contractor hereunder (regardless of whether such payment obligation is imposed
by the terms of this Agreement or pursuant to Applicable Law, or otherwise)
shall bear interest at the Contract Interest Rate as of the date due from
the
date due until the date paid.



7.           COMMENCEMENT
AND SCHEDULING OF THE WORK



7.1           Notices
to Proceed.



7.1.1                Limited
Notice to Proceed.  On the Limited Notice to Proceed Date,
Contractor shall commence preparing the drawings and specifications described
in
Section 3.18.1, in accordance
with the Project Schedules, and shall thereafter diligently pursue such portions
of the Work, assigning to it a priority as necessary for the Project to achieve
Substantial Completion and Final Completion on or before the respective Project
Guaranteed Dates.  Notwithstanding the issuance of a Limited Notice to
Proceed, in no event shall Contractor proceed with procurement of any Equipment
or Materials without Owner’s prior written approval.  The scope of the
Work to be completed pursuant to the Limited Notice to Proceed may be altered
or
expanded from time to time pursuant to one or more further Limited Notices
to
Proceed until Owner issues a Full Notice to Proceed.



7.1.2                Full
Notice to Proceed.  On the Full Notice to Proceed Date, Contractor
shall commence with the performance of the remainder of the Work in accordance
with the






EXECUTION
COPY







46

















Milestone
Summary Schedule and shall thereafter diligently pursue the Work assigning
to it
a priority as necessary for the Project to achieve Substantial Completion
on or
before the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date, and Final Completion on
or
before the Final Completion Guaranteed Date.  In the event Owner
releases Contractor to commence Work on the Project Site prior to completing
the
Required Owner Activities pursuant to Section 2.6, Contractor shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to commence certain on-Project Site portions of the Work,
including, but not limited to, constructing a fence around the parameter
of the
Project Site, establishing access roads over the Project Site necessary for
construction of the Project, establishing lay-down areas with respect to
prosecution of the Work, or other activities described on the Project Schedule,
so as not to cause a delay in the Milestone Summary Schedule, to the extent
reasonably possible.



7.2           Contractor’s
Acknowledgment.  Contractor expressly agrees that the period of
time specified to complete all Work and the timely achievement of the Project
Guaranteed Dates includes allowance for coordination with Owner, the existing
operations at Units 1-4 (but with respect to Units 1-2 only until April 25,
2007
and with respect to Unit 3 only until August 25, 2007), Owner’s Engineer and for
all hindrances and delays incident to the Work (other than an Excusable Event
or
an event of Force Majeure).  No claim shall be made by Contractor for
hindrances or delays for any cause during the progress of the Work, except
as
provided under Articles 8 and 16.



7.3           Prosecution
of Work.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Contractor shall prosecute the Work in accordance with the Project Schedules
to
cause Substantial Completion and Final Completion to occur.



7.4           Project
Schedule.



7.4.1                Project
Schedule.  Within forty-five (45) days after the Limited
Notice to Proceed Date, Contractor shall provide Owner with a digital and
hard
copy of the first one hundred eighty (180) days of the Project Schedule together
with the Owner’s interfaces with Contractor.  Within ninety (90) days
after the Full Notice to Proceed Date, Contractor shall provide Owner with
a
digital and hard copy of the Project Schedule that satisfies the requirements
set forth in Part I, Section 5.2.2 of the Scope Book and is consistent with
the
Milestone Summary Schedule.  Until Substantial Completion, Contractor
shall update the Milestone Summary Schedule to reflect the current status
of the
Work.  Following Substantial Completion, Contractor shall update the
Milestone Summary Schedule in accordance with the Remedial Plan, if any,
or
otherwise periodically but not less than quarterly.  At a minimum, the
updates shall be performed and provided to Owner (in digital and hard-copy
form)
on a monthly basis as part of the Project Progress Report.  Contractor
shall also update the Project Schedule at least every three
months.  Contractor shall promptly advise Owner of any proposed
Milestone Summary Schedule changes of more than fifteen (15) days and the
reasons therefor.  Contractor shall employ a project management system
capable of providing schedule monitoring and analysis which shall include
a
comparison of the Milestone Summary Schedule with the actual progress for
each
time period with all variances noted.  Schedule analysis shall include
a determination of the impact of such variance, if material, on the Milestone
Summary Schedule and any action necessary to correct the
variance.  Utilizing the critical path method, Contractor shall
continually evaluate factors that are delaying or that could delay completion
of
the






EXECUTION
COPY







47

















Substantial
Completion Guaranteed Date, and Contractor shall take remedial actions
reasonably within its control to eliminate or minimize its schedule delays
including over-time for the employees of Contractor and Subcontractors and
the
assignment of additional personnel or other resources.



7.4.2                Milestone
Summary Schedule.  Attached hereto as Exhibit G is the
Milestone Summary Schedule which lists the Critical Path Items, including
the
Project Guaranteed Dates, and the applicable dates of completion for each
such
Critical Path Item.  The Project Guaranteed Dates shall not be
amended, adjusted or revised without Owner’s prior written approval pursuant to
a Change In Work Form.



7.5           Acceleration
Plan.  If the most recent version of the Milestone Summary
Schedule shows Substantial Completion occurring thirty (30) or more days
after
the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date, or Contractor fails to complete
any
of the Critical Path Items set forth in the Milestone Summary Schedule such
that
Substantial Completion is scheduled to occur thirty (30) days or more after
the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date, Contractor shall, within
ten (10) days after Contractor becomes aware of such delay, submit for
approval by Owner, a written plan (the “Acceleration Plan”)
describing the actions (including acceleration of the Work, for example,
by
using additional shifts, overtime, additional crews or resequencing of the
Work,
as applicable) Contractor will take so that Substantial Completion of the
Project will reasonably likely occur by the Substantial Completion Guaranteed
Date.  Owner shall determine whether to approve or disapprove such
proposed Acceleration Plan in good faith.  If Owner disapproves all or
any portion of the Acceleration Plan, Owner shall approve those portions
of the
Acceleration Plan that are acceptable and provide comments to those portions
of
the Acceleration Plan that have been disapproved.  Contractor shall
revise the Acceleration Plan to address such comments as shall have been
provided by Owner, if any, and resubmit the revised Acceleration Plan for
Owner’s further comments within two (2) Business Days after Contractor’s
receipt of comments from Owner; provided, however, that in the
event Contractor provides Notice to Owner within such (2) Business Day period
that Contractor is attempting in good faith to incorporate such comments
provided by Owner but requires additional time to resubmit the revised
Acceleration Plan to Owner, Contractor shall have an additional five (5)
Business Days to resubmit such revised Acceleration Plan to
Owner.  Upon approval by Owner, Contractor shall promptly proceed with
completing the Work in the manner specified by the Acceleration Plan and
with
any additional work as may be required under the Acceleration
Plan.  Subject to Section 19.1(j), if Contractor, other than
due to an
Excusable Event or an event of Force Majeure, continues to fall behind the
schedule set forth in an approved Acceleration Plan, then, upon Notice from
Owner, Contractor shall update or modify such approved Acceleration Plan
so as
to remedy the failure to meet such schedule (and such update or modification
shall be re-submitted for Owner’s approval pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 7.5).  Upon approval by Owner
of any such update or modification, Contractor shall promptly proceed with
completing the Work in the manner specified by such updated or modified
Acceleration Plan.  Contractor shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses of implementing the Acceleration Plan without any increase to the
Contract Price.  Review and approval of the Acceleration Plan by Owner
shall not be deemed in any way to relieve Contractor of its obligations under
this Agreement relating to the failure to achieve Substantial Completion
or
Final Completion by the applicable Project Guaranteed Dates and shall not
be a
basis for an increase in the Contract Price.






EXECUTION
COPY







48

















7.6           Meetings.  Contractor
shall schedule and conduct monthly meetings with Owner in accordance with
the
requirements of Exhibit A at the Project Site, or such other
location as the Parties may agree, for the purpose of reviewing the progress
of
the Work and adherence to the Milestone Summary Schedule and the Project
Schedule.  The frequency of such meetings shall be established and
modified, from time to time, by mutual agreement of the Parties;
provided, however, such meetings shall occur no less frequently
than monthly; provided, further, if the Milestone Summary Schedule
indicates that Substantial Completion is scheduled to occur thirty (30)
days or more after the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date, Owner shall
be
entitled to require that meetings occur as frequently as weekly.  If
Owner so requests, Contractor shall cause a representative of any Subcontractor
to attend such meeting.  After commencement of the Work at the Project
Site, Owner, Contractor, and any Major Subcontractor then performing Work
on the
Project Site shall each designate a representative to attend weekly meetings
to
review and discuss the progress of the Work.  Contractor’s
representative at such weekly meeting shall provide a rolling three-week
look
ahead schedule outlining the Work to be performed at the Project Site during
the
three calendar weeks following such meeting.



7.7           Acceleration
of Work When Not Delayed.  Owner shall also have the right to
direct that the Work be accelerated by means of overtime, additional crews
or
additional shifts or resequencing of the Work notwithstanding that the Work
is
progressing without delay in accordance with the established Project Schedule
except to the extent that Contractor, acting reasonably, determines and notifies
Owner in writing that such acceleration would present safety concerns or
has
already been accelerated and further acceleration is not reasonably
practicable.  Absent agreement on a fixed price, the Contract Price
shall be adjusted in accordance with the terms of Sections 16.4 through 16.9.  In
the event of any
acceleration requested pursuant to this Section 7.7, Contractor shall promptly
provide a plan
for such acceleration, including Contractor’s recommendations for the most
effective and economical acceleration.  The Critical Path Items and
the Project Completion Dates shall be adjusted as agreed upon by Contractor
and
Owner pursuant to an Owner initiated Change In Work Form.  Any
acceleration of the Work when the Work is not delayed and such acceleration
is
not specifically requested by Owner in writing shall be at Contractor’s sole
cost and expense.



7.8           Termination
if Limited Notice to Proceed Cap is Exceeded.  Either Party may
elect to terminate this Agreement, by providing five (5) Business Days Notice
to
the other Party, if the portion of the Contract Price for the Work performed
up
to the effective date of termination plus the amount of cancellation charges
anticipated to be incurred with respect to Equipment and Materials ordered
to
date exceeds $50,000,000 in the aggregate, or a greater amount as mutually
agreed by Owner and Contractor pursuant to any Limited Notice to
Proceed.  Upon such election to terminate by Owner, Owner shall have
the right at its sole option to assume and become liable for any written
obligations and commitments that Contractor may have undertaken in accordance
with Section 20.4.  Following such termination,
Owner shall pay Contractor pursuant to Section 20.1 for Work performed, provided that
such amounts may be modified by Owner's assumption of the liabilities referenced
in the previous sentence.



8.           FORCE
MAJEURE AND EXCUSABLE EVENTS



8.1           Force
Majeure.  No failure or omission to carry out or observe any of
the terms, provisions, or conditions of this Agreement shall give rise to
any
claim by either Party against






EXECUTION
COPY







49

















any
other Party hereto, or be deemed to be a breach or default of this Agreement
if
such failure or omission shall be caused by or arise out of an event of Force
Majeure.  No obligations of either Party that matured before the
occurrence of an event of Force Majeure causing the suspension of performance
shall be excused as a result of such occurrence.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the obligation to pay money in
a
timely manner shall not be subject to the Force Majeure provisions.



8.2           Notice.  If
either Party’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement is
affected by an event of Force Majeure or an Excusable Event, such Party shall,
within two (2) Business Days with respect to an event of Force Majeure or
five
(5) Business Days with respect to an Excusable Event, after such Party becomes
aware of the impact or it would be commercially reasonable to expect that
such
party should have became aware of impact of such event of Force Majeure or
Excusable Event (without imposing any duty to investigate upon such party),
give
Notice to the other Party (a “Delay Notice”) of the occurrence
of such event.  Within five (5) days after delivery of such
Notice, the Party claiming an event of Force Majeure or an Excusable Event
shall
provide reasonable evidence to the other Party of the nature of the event,
its
anticipated duration and effect upon the performance of such Party’s
obligations, and any action being taken to avoid or minimize its
effect.  The Party claiming an event of Force Majeure or an Excusable
Event shall have a continuing obligation to deliver to the other Party
additional documentation and analysis supporting its claim regarding an event
of
Force Majeure or an Excusable Event promptly after such information is available
to the Party claiming such event of Force Majeure or an Excusable
Event.  The burden of proof shall be on the Party claiming to be
affected pursuant to this Section 8.2.  Within two (2) days after an
event of Force Majeure or an Excusable Event has ended, the Party that was
affected by such event of Force Majeure or an Excusable Event shall give
Notice
to the other Party of: (i) the length of time such event of Force Majeure
or an Excusable Event was in effect and such Party was affected by the impact
of
such event; and (ii) the effect, if any, such Party claims such event of
Force Majeure or an Excusable Event had on the applicable Project Guaranteed
Dates or the Contract Price as provided in Sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2.  If
Contractor fails to
provide Notice of an event of Force Majeure within the time specified in
this
Section 8.2, Contractor’s
entitlement to adjustments to the Project Guaranteed Dates or the Contract
Price
pursuant to a Change In Work pursuant to Sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2
shall be reduced to the extent Owner has
suffered any material adverse impact as a result of Contractor’s delay in
providing such Notice.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, Contractor shall
have no obligation to provide Notice of an event of Force Majeure to any
Governmental Authority or Alcoa.



8.3           Scope
of Suspension; Duty to Mitigate.  The suspension of or impact on
performance due to an event of Force Majeure or an Excusable Event shall
be of
no greater scope and no longer duration than is required by such
event.  The excused Party shall use its reasonable
efforts:



(a)           to
mitigate the duration of, and costs arising from, any suspension or delay
in, or
other impact to the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement;



(b)           to
continue to perform its obligations hereunder; and



(c)           to
remedy its inability to perform, as applicable.






EXECUTION
COPY







50

















In
addition, the Party not claiming an event of Force Majeure may identify and
recommend measures designed to mitigate the duration of, and costs arising
from,
any suspension or delay in, or other impact to the performance of the affected
Party hereunder and such affected Party shall adopt such measures to the
extent
the same are reasonable and lawful.  When the affected Party is able
to resume performance of its obligation under this Agreement, such affected
Party shall give the other Party Notice to that effect.



8.4           Removal
of Force Majeure.  If, within a reasonable time after the
occurrence of an event of Force Majeure that has caused Contractor to suspend
or
delay performance of the Work, Owner has identified and recommended to
Contractor commercially reasonable action to be undertaken, and Contractor
has
failed within ten (10) days after receipt of Notice from Owner thereof to
take
such action as Contractor could lawfully and reasonably initiate to remove
or
relieve either the event which caused such an event of Force Majeure or its
direct or indirect effects, Owner may, in its sole discretion and after Notice
to Contractor, initiate such reasonable measures as will be designed to remove
or relieve such an event of Force Majeure or its direct or indirect effects
and
thereafter require Contractor to resume full or partial performance of the
Work.  Owner may off-set the reasonable costs it incurs in taking such
measures against any payments owed to Contractor
hereunder.



8.5           Responsibility
of Contractor.  Subject to the limitations on liability contained
in this Agreement, damages or injuries to persons or properties resulting
from
an event of Force Majeure during the performance of the obligations provided
for
in this Agreement shall not relieve Contractor of any responsibility it may
have
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to bear the cost of the damage or
injuries caused by Contractor’s negligence or misconduct.



8.6           Contractor’s
Remedies.



8.6.1                Force
Majeure.  As Contractor’s only remedy for the occurrence of an
event of Force Majeure, subject to Section 8.7, and provided that Contractor has
complied with the provisions of Sections 8.2, 8.3
and 8.4, if an event of Force Majeure
occurs: (i) the Project Guaranteed Dates shall be extended and the
Milestone Summary Schedule shall be correspondingly adjusted by the period
of
time, if any, that Contractor is actually and demonstrably delayed in the
performance of Critical Path Item(s) as a result of the impact of such an
event
of Force Majeure, and (ii) if Contractor’s costs actually and demonstrably
increase despite Contractor’s commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
such increases, the Contract Price shall be adjusted by the sum of: (x) the
difference of the direct costs (without profit, overhead or contingency)
including incremental stand by costs, if any, incurred by the Contractor
because
of such Force Majeure, less any savings or costs not incurred because of
such
event of Force Majeure, plus (y) an allowance for profit, overhead, contingency
and escalation, in each case as set forth in a Change In Work Form;
provided, however, that in no event shall any Change In Work
include contingency amounts related to the Labor Pool (as defined in
Exhibit I); provided, further, that an event of Force
Majeure may result in a modification or amendment to the Agreement if mutually
agreed by Contractor and Owner as pursuant to Section 33.4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Contract Price shall not be adjusted for the first Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) in the aggregate of incremental standby costs incurred as a
result
of an event or events of Force Majeure in accordance with this Section 8.6.1.

Event.  As Contractor’s only remedy for the occurrence of an

with the provisions of Sections 8.2, 8.3
and 8.4, if an Excusable Event occurs
(i) the Project Guaranteed Dates shall be extended and the Milestone
Summary Schedule shall be correspondingly adjusted by the period of time,
if
any, that Contractor is actually and demonstrably delayed in the performance
of
Critical Path Item(s) as a result of such Excusable Event, and (ii) if
Contractor’s cost actually and demonstrably increase despite Contractor’s
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such increases, the Contract
Price shall be adjusted by the sum of: (x) the difference of the direct costs
(without profit, overhead or contingency) incurred by the Contractor because
of
such Excusable Event, less any savings or costs not incurred because of such
Excusable Event, plus (y) an allowance for profit, overhead, contingency

of Minimum Stable Load.  When Contractor believes that it has
achieved Minimum Stable Load, Contractor shall deliver to Owner a Notice
of
Minimum Stable Load.  Owner shall promptly issue an Owner’s
Certificate of Minimum Stable Load, or if Owner rejects Contractor’s Notice of
Minimum Stable Load, respond in writing giving its reasons for such rejection
and Contractor shall take the appropriate corrective action, as
applicable.  Upon completion of any such applicable corrective action,
Contractor shall provide a new Notice of Minimum Stable Load to Owner for
approval.  This process shall be repeated on an iterative basis until
Owner accepts the Notice of Minimum Stable Load and issues an Owner’s
Certificate of Minimum Stable Load.  Owner shall use commercially

Completion:



(a)           an
Acceptance Test has been completed;



(b)           Contractor
or any Subcontractor makes any modification to the Project; and



(c)           such
modification could have had a material effect on the outcome of such Acceptance
Test, if it had been made before the completion of such Acceptance Test,
then
Contractor and Owner shall agree on an appropriate test of the modified
components or such Acceptance Test shall be re-run, as a condition to achieving
Substantial Completion.



14.           SUBSTANTIAL
COMPLETION AND FINAL COMPLETION



14.1           Punchlist.



14.1.1               Creation
of Punchlist.  When Contractor believes that a system is ready for
commissioning and start up, Contractor shall prepare and submit to Owner
a
punchlist of Work remaining to be completed with respect to such
system.  Any Non-Critical Deficiencies with respect to each system
will be included on a list of items of Work that may be completed after the
Substantial Completion Date, which list shall include, for each Non-Critical
Deficiency, a proposed schedule and estimated cost for the completion or
repair
of such Non-Critical Deficiency (the “Proposed
Punchlist”).  Owner and Contractor shall determine whether
the Proposed Punchlist includes all Non-Critical Deficiencies for such system,
whether the Proposed Punchlist includes only Non-Critical Deficiencies and
whether the system is complete except for those items described in the Proposed
Punchlist.  If Owner’s inspection discloses any Non-Critical
Deficiency that has been excluded from the Proposed Punchlist, any item
described on the Proposed Punchlist that is not a Non-Critical Deficiency,
any
item of Work included in the system that is incomplete or Defective (other
than
Non-Critical Deficiencies described on the Proposed Punchlist) or that the
estimated cost for the completion or repair of any Non-Critical Deficiency
is
not a reasonable estimate of such costs, Owner shall deliver Notice thereof
to
Contractor.  If Owner does not deliver such a Notice to Contractor
within twenty (20) days after Owner receives the Proposed Punchlist, the
Proposed Punchlist shall be deemed acceptable to Owner.  If Owner
delivers such a Notice to Contractor, Contractor shall complete any items
of
Work other than Non-Critical Deficiencies, revise the Proposed Punchlist
to
include all Non-Critical Deficiencies identified by Owner (whether or not
such
items are disputed by Contractor) and resubmit the revised Proposed Punchlist
to
Owner for review.  Owner may then re-inspect the Project and the
foregoing process shall continue on an iterative basis until Owner has approved
the Proposed Punchlist.  The aggregate of all Proposed Punchlists that
are acceptable or deemed acceptable to Owner shall sometimes be referred
to as
the “Punchlist.”  If the Punchlist is not finalized
by the Substantial Completion Date, the Proposed Punchlist as






EXECUTION
COPY







61

















modified
by Owner shall be deemed the Punchlist for all purposes hereunder until the
Parties resolve such dispute and otherwise finalize the Punchlist, and
Contractor shall note on such Proposed Punchlist the items under
dispute.  Within five (5) days after Substantial Completion Date,
Non-Critical Deficiencies discovered by Contractor or identified by Owner
after
the initial inspection of each system by Owner and Contractor or during the
testing the Project shall be added to the Punchlist.



14.1.2               Completion
of Punchlist.  Contractor shall proceed promptly to complete and
correct all items on the Punchlist in accordance with the schedule to complete
such items to be agreed upon by the Parties as soon as practical after
Substantial Completion.  Failure to include an item on the Punchlist
does not alter Contractor’s responsibility to complete all Work in accordance
with this Agreement.  Contractor shall complete all items on the
Punchlist promptly after Owner receives such Punchlist and in any event in
accordance with the schedule set forth in such Punchlist.  On a
bi-weekly basis after Substantial Completion, Contractor shall revise and
update
the Punchlist to include the date(s) that items listed on such Punchlist
are
completed by Contractor and accepted by Owner.  Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, the items listed on such Punchlist shall not be considered
complete until Owner shall have inspected such Non-Critical Deficiencies
and
acknowledged, by notation on the updated Punchlists, that such item of Work
is
complete.



14.1.3               Owner’s
Punchlist Option.  At any time after the Final Completion
Guaranteed Date, Owner may elect by Notice to Contractor to draw an amount
from
the Retainage Security, or withhold or retain all or such portion of any
payment
due to Contractor, in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%)
of the
estimated cost to complete the uncompleted items on the Punchlist in lieu
of
requiring Contractor to complete such items.  Owner shall determine
which items on the Punchlist have not been completed and, within fifteen
(15)
days of Owner’s written request, Contractor shall reasonably estimate in writing
the cost to complete such items.  Owner may thereafter draw such
amount from the Retainage Security or withhold or retain such amount from
any
payment due to Contractor in satisfaction of Contractor’s obligation to complete
such items.



14.2           Substantial
Completion.  The following are conditions precedent to Substantial
Completion:



(a)           Owner
has received copies of all Contractor Acquired Permits and associated approvals
required to be obtained by Contractor pursuant to Section 3.8;



(b)           Owner
has received all Contractor Deliverables required to be delivered by Substantial
Completion in accordance with the Contractor Submittals Table, including
all
Required Manuals necessary to operate the Project in a safe and reliable
manner;



(c)           Contractor
has certified by a Notice to Owner that all training of Operating Personnel
is
complete;



(d)           the
Punchlist shall have been finalized or deemed completed as provided in
Section 14.1.1; subject to the
addition of further Punchlist items pursuant to Section 14.1.1;

(g)           each
of the following have been satisfied:



(i)           each
Acceptance Test that is required to be run for Substantial Completion pursuant
to Part I, Section 8.3, Table 8-2 of the Scope Book, has been completed in
accordance with the test procedures as set forth in Part I, Section 8.2 of
the Scope Book, including such procedures as have been developed and mutually
agreed to Owner and Contractor; and



(ii)           the
Project shall have achieved the Performance Guarantees (except for those
Emissions Guarantees that will not be tested until after Substantial Completion
pursuant to Part I, Section 8.1.5, Table 1 of the Scope Book, the Ammonia
Consumption Rate Guarantee, and the Limestone Consumption Rate Guarantee),
or
the Project shall have achieved the Minimum Performance Criteria;



(h)           Contractor
shall have licensed all Intellectual Property Rights to Owner;
and



(i)           all
operational spare parts to be purchased or reconditioned by Contractor pursuant

applicable, been reconditioned or been delivered or purchased for delivery
to
Owner free and clear of any liens, claims, charges, security interests and
encumbrances whatsoever, and all special tools have been turned over to
Owner.



14.3           Notice
of Substantial Completion.  When Contractor believes that it has
satisfied the provisions of Section 14.2, Contractor shall deliver
to Owner a
Notice of Substantial Completion.  Such Notice of Substantial
Completion shall contain a report of the Work completed and a report setting
forth the results of the completed Acceptance Tests with sufficient detail
to
enable Owner to determine whether Substantial Completion has been
achieved.  The Substantial Completion Date shall be the date on which
the last of the conditions of Section 14.2 was satisfied or, in the sole
discretion
of Owner, waived.  Owner shall promptly issue an Owner’s Certificate
of Substantial Completion dated to reflect the Substantial Completion Date,
or
if Owner rejects Contractor’s Notice of Substantial Completion, respond in
writing giving its reasons for such rejection and Contractor shall take the
appropriate corrective action, as applicable.  Upon completion of any
such applicable corrective action, Contractor shall provide a new Notice
of
Substantial Completion to Owner for approval.  This process shall be
repeated on an iterative basis until Owner accepts the Notice of Substantial
Completion and issues an Owner’s Certificate of Substantial
Completion.  Owner shall issue its acceptance or rejection of the
initial Notice of Substantial Completion and any subsequent iterations within
ten (10) days after receipt thereof.  If Owner fails to respond to a
Notice of Substantial Completion within such ten (10) day period and
subsequently delivers comments to Contractor’s Notice of Substantial Completion,
Owner shall waive any Delay Liquidated Damages that would have
otherwise






EXECUTION
COPY







63

















accrued
for the number of days equal to the number of days by which Owner’s response was
delayed; provided, however, in the event that Owner’s response was
delayed for a period greater than twenty (20) days Owner shall also be obligated
to pay Contractor’s reasonable incremental stand-by costs, if any, for such
extended period.  Contractor shall pay the amount of undisputed Delay
Liquidated Damages due and owing pursuant to Section 15.1, if any, to Owner by the date
which is
five (5) days after the date on which Contractor receives an invoice from
Owner
for such Delay Liquidated Damages, provided such invoice shall be dated
no earlier than the Owner’s Certificate of Substantial Completion.



14.4           Final
Completion.  Final Completion of the Project shall be deemed to
have occurred only if all of the following have occurred:



(a)           Substantial
Completion has been achieved;



(b)           all
of the Acceptance Tests not successfully completed prior to Substantial
Completion shall have been completed in accordance with the test procedures
as
set forth in Part I, Section 8.2 of the Scope Book, including such
procedures as have been developed and mutually agreed to Owner and
Contractor;



(c)           the

Book, test data, performance data, Equipment and Materials descriptions,
Required Manuals, training aids, Spare Parts Schedule, and other technical
information each as required hereunder for Owner to operate and maintain
the
Project;



(j)           all
Contractor’s and Subcontractors’ personnel (except as required to perform any
on-going warranty support services) shall have left the Project Site, and
all

condition
that such permanent facilities and the Project Site were in on the Full Notice
to Proceed Date, ordinary wear and tear excepted.  All cleanup and
disposal shall be conducted in accordance with all Applicable Laws and
Applicable Permits;



(k)           Contractor
shall have assigned to Owner, or provided Owner, with all warranties or
guarantees that Contractor received from Subcontractors to the extent Contractor
is obligated to do so pursuant to Article 17;



(l)           Contractor
has delivered an Conditional Waiver and Release Upon Final Payment of Contractor
and an Unconditional Waiver and Release Upon Final Payment of Subcontractor
from
the Major Subcontractors, or to the extent that Unconditional Waivers and
Releases Upon Final Payment are not provided by any such Major Subcontractor,
Contractor has delivered security in amount, form and from a provider acceptable
to Owner that, in Owner’s reasonable discretion, is sufficient to ensure that
any encumbrance that may be asserted can be removed without expense to Owner;
and



(m)           Contractor
shall have paid to Owner all Delay Liquidated Damages and Performance Liquidated
Damages (including any disputed amounts not previously paid) due and owing
pursuant to the terms of Sections 15.1 and 15.3,
or, with respect to any Delay Liquidated
Damages or Performance Liquidated Damages disputed by Contractor in good
faith,
Contractor shall have delivered an irrevocable standby letter of credit securing
such disputed obligations, from a financial institution that has senior
unsecured debt rated at least A by Standard & Poor’s or A2 by Moody’s (or an
equivalent rating from such other equivalent rating agency as may be approved
by
Owner), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Owner, and in an amount
equal to such disputed amount, which Owner may draw upon in the event of
entry
of a judgment against Contractor from a court having jurisdiction over such
matter in accordance with Section 32.2 or upon receipt of notice
from such
financial institution that such letter of credit shall not be renewed and
Owner
has not been provided a replacement irrevocable standby letter of credit
in
equal amount and otherwise conforming to the requirements of this
Section 14.4(m).  Notwithstanding
the
foregoing, Contractor shall remain liable for payment of Delay Liquidated
Damages and Performance Damages following Final Completion, unless and to
the
extent such liability has been fully extinguished by Owner's draws under
such
letter of credit.



14.5           Notice
of Final Completion.  Contractor shall deliver to Owner a Notice
of Final Completion stating that Contractor believes it has satisfied the
provisions of Section 14.4.  Owner shall promptly issue
an
Owner’s Certificate of Final Completion to Contractor evidencing that, to the
best of Owner’s knowledge, all of Contractor’s construction obligations under
this Agreement have been satisfied and Final Completion has been achieved,
or if
Owner rejects Contractor’s Notice of Final Completion, respond in writing giving
Owner’s reasons for such rejection and Contractor shall promptly take the
appropriate corrective action.  Upon completion of such corrective
action, Contractor shall resubmit a Notice of Final Completion to Owner for
approval.  This process shall be repeated until Owner accepts
Contractor’s Notice of Final Completion and issues an Owner’s Certificate of
Final Completion.  Owner shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
accept or reject the initial Notice of Final Completion and any subsequent
iterations within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.  If Owner fails
to respond within  thirty (30) days of receipt beyond such time
period, and at any time during such subsequent review process Owner rejects
Contractor’s Notice of Final Completion, at such time as the






EXECUTION
COPY







65

















Owner’s
Certificate of Final Completion is issued Owner agrees to reduce the amount
of
days by which it is obligated to make the Final Payment (including any
applicable bonus amount) on a day for day basis for each day in excess of
such
time period by which Owner failed to respond.



14.6           Contractor’s
Access After Substantial Completion and Final
Completion.  Following Substantial Completion, Owner shall provide
Contractor with reasonable and timely access to the Project to complete all
items on the Punchlist and to satisfy the other requirements for Final
Completion.  Contractor shall also be provided with access to the
Project during the Cure Period in accordance with Section 15.4.9.  The Parties expect that
Contractor shall accomplish any necessary modification, repairs or additional
work to the extent practicable with minimal interference with commercial
operation of the Project and that reductions in and shut-downs of the Project’s
operations will be required only when necessary, taking into consideration
the
length of the proposed reduction or shut-down, and Owner’s obligations and
liabilities to customers or others.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
should a reduction in or shut-down of the Project’s operations be required to
complete any items on the Punchlist, then such reduction or shut-down shall
be
scheduled solely at the discretion of Owner in accordance with the provisions
of
Section 15.4.12.1.



14.7           Subcontractor
Air
Quality Performance
Requirements.
If
performance requirements or guarantees are
secured from a Subcontractor
providing the air quality control system which extend beyond or exceed the
performance requirements required to
support Contractor’s obligations under this Agreement and if, at Final
Completion, such Subcontractor has not achieved such performance
requirements or
guarantees, Contractor will
use commercially reasonable efforts (not including
litigation) to enforce such performance
requirements or guarantees
for
the benefit of Owner,
with the understanding that such efforts shall not prejudice Contractor’s
enforcement of its own rights against such Subcontractor and that successful
enforcement of such performance requirements or guarantees against
such Subcontractor
will not be a condition
of
occurrence of Final Completion provided each of the
conditions to
Final Completion contained in Section 14.4
have been successfully achieved by
Contractor (provided
that the required Unconditional
Waiver and Release Upon Final Payment shall be
waived with respect
to payment of amounts
related to the emissions guarantees under the subcontract
or purchase order
relating to air quality control system).  For
purposes
of this Section 14.7,
“commercially
reasonably efforts”
shall be limited to a maximum of two hundred (200) hours for all
purposes, unless a Change
in Work Form is agreed with respect to payment in excess of such
maximum.  Contractor shall provide
Notice to Owner following Contractor's exhaustion of commercially reasonable
efforts to enforce such requirement or guarantees of such Subcontractor under
this Section
14.7.  In
the event that
Contractor is unable, despite having used commercially reasonable efforts,
to
enforce such performance requirements or guarantees against a Subcontractor
providing the air quality control systems which extend beyond or exceed the
performance requirements required to support Contractor's obligations under
this
Agreement, Owner, at its option and upon prior written Notice to Contractor,
may
enforce the particular requirement or guarantee against such
Subcontractor.  Without limiting Owner's rights under Section 17.6,
Contractor shall, at the request and
direction of Owner,
and without recourse to Contractor, at any time following Owner's receipt
of the
Notice contemplated under this Section 14.7,
(i) assign
all such purchase order or
subcontract relating to the air quality control system and (ii) pay to Owner the
amounts remaining
to be paid to such Subcontractor, if any and only to the extent such amounts
have been previously paid by Owner to Contractor, related to the

emissions
guarantees of such subcontract
or purchase order
relating to the air quality control system.



15.           LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES AND CURE PERIOD



15.1           Liquidated
Damages for Delay in the Substantial Completion Dates.  Contractor
acknowledges that if the Substantial Completion Date does not occur on or
before
the Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date, Owner will suffer substantial
damages that are difficult to ascertain.  Therefore, the Parties agree
that if Substantial Completion is not achieved by the Substantial Completion
Guaranteed Date Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to Owner in the amount
of *** Dollars ($***) for each day (or portion thereof) of such delay
(“Delay Liquidated Damages”) and that the Delay Liquidated
Damages shall apply regardless of the actual amount of damage that may be
suffered.  Any amount Contractor is obligated to pay to Owner under
this Section 15.1 shall be due
and payable as set forth in Section 14.3.  Disputed Delay Liquidated
Damages that are ultimately determined to be due and owing shall accrue interest
at the Contract Interest Rate as of the date such amounts should have been
paid
if undisputed, from such date until paid.



15.2           Liquidated
Damages for Failure to Satisfy the Reliability
Guarantee.  Contractor acknowledges that if the Reliability
Guarantee has not been satisfied by the Final Completion Guaranteed Date,
Owner
will suffer substantial damages that are difficult to
ascertain.  Therefore, the Parties agree that if the Reliability
Guarantee is not satisfied, Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to Owner
in
the amount of *** Dollars ($***) per percent by which the Equivalent
Availability Factor is less than *** percent (***%) and equal to or greater
than
*** percent (***%), and *** Dollars ($***) per percent by which the Equivalent
Availability Factor is less than *** percent (***%) during the Reliability
Test,
which in each case shall be pro rated for any portion of a percent by which
the
Equivalent Availability Factor is less than the applicable percentage (such
damages collectively, the “Reliability Liquidated Damages”) and
that the Reliability Liquidated Damages shall apply regardless of the actual
amount of damage that may be suffered.  Any amount Contractor is
obligated to pay to Owner under this Section 15.2 shall be due and payable on
the earlier to
occur of (a) the achievement of Final Completion (other than with respect
to the
condition contained in Section 14.4(e)) or (b) the Final Completion
Guaranteed
Date.

15.3           Liquidated
Damages for Failure to Satisfy Certain Performance
Guarantees.  Contractor acknowledges that if the Project does not
achieve the Net Capacity Guarantee and the Net Heat Rate Guarantee, Owner
will
suffer substantial damages that are difficult to
ascertain.  Therefore, the Parties agree that if the Project does not
achieve the Net Capacity Guarantee, as calculated in accordance with Part
I,
Section 8.2.1 of the Scope Book, Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to
Owner in the amount of *** Dollars ($***) per kilowatt for each kilowatt
by
which the Project fails to satisfy the Net Capacity Guarantee.  The
Parties further agree that if the Project does not achieve the Net Heat Rate
Guarantee, as calculated in accordance with Part I, Section 8.2.2 of the
Scope Book, Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to Owner in the amount
of
*** Dollars ($***) per Btu/kilowatt for each Btu/kilowatt
by which the Project exceeds the Net Heat Rate Guarantee.  In
addition, the Parties agree that if the Project does not  achieve (i)
the Ammonia Consumption Rate Guarantee, as calculated in accordance with
Part I,
Section 8.1.4 of the Scope Book, Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to
Owner in the amount of *** Dollars ($***) per lb/hour for each lb/hour by
which
the Project exceeds the Ammonia Consumption Rate Guarantee, and (ii) the
Limestone Consumption Rate Guarantee, as calculated in accordance with Part
I,
Section 8.1.3 of the Scope Book, Contractor shall pay liquidated damages to
Owner in the amount of *** Dollars ($***) per lb/hour for each lb/hour by
which
the Project exceeds the Limestone Consumption Rate Guarantee.  The
Parties agree that the foregoing liquidated damages described in this
Section 15.3 with respect to
failure of the Project to achieve the Net Capacity Guarantee, the Net Heat
Rate
Guarantee, the Ammonia Consumption Rate Guarantee, or the Limestone Consumption
Rate Guarantee shall apply regardless of the actual amount of damage that
may be
suffered.  Performance Liquidated Damages that are ultimately
determined to be due and owing shall accrue interest at the Contract Interest
Rate as of the date such amounts should have been paid if undisputed, from
such
date until paid.



15.4           Actions
During the Cure Period.



15.4.1                Buy-Down
Not Available.  If Contractor has failed to achieve the Minimum
Performance Criteria with respect to the Net Capacity and the Net Heat Rate,
Contractor shall not be entitled to pay the Performance Liquidated Damages
pursuant to Section 15.4.2(a) to
achieve Substantial Completion and must continue seeking to satisfy the
Performance Guarantees and to achieve the Minimum Performance Criteria, and
shall pay Delay Liquidated Damages due and owing under Section 15.1 until Contractor achieves
Substantial
Completion.



15.4.2                Buy-Down
or Cure.  If the Project has achieved Substantial Completion, but
has failed to achieve the Net Capacity Guarantee or the Net Heat Rate Guarantee,
Contractor, at its option, may elect to either:








***
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
COMMISSION.






EXECUTION
COPY







68






















(a)           pay
Owner the Performance Liquidated Damages as determined pursuant to
Section 15.3 based on the
results of the most recently completed Performance Tests used to determine
whether Contractor satisfied the applicable Performance Guarantee, and upon
such
payment Contractor shall have no further obligation to satisfy the Performance
Guarantees, including for purposes of achieving Final Completion;
or



(b)           submit
a Remedial Plan to Owner for review and approval as set forth in
Section 15.4.6 within
ten (10) days after the Substantial Completion Date, or if related to
further Remedial Plans implemented during the Cure Period, after Contractor
completes additional Performance Tests, as applicable.



15.4.3                Election
of Option.  Contractor shall exercise the option provided in
Section 15.4.2 by delivery of
Notice to Owner not later than ten (10) days after either the Substantial
Completion Date or the date of the last completed Performance Test; or  the
expiration of a previously implemented Remedial Plan, as
applicable.  For the avoidance of doubt, Contractor may,
notwithstanding Contractor’s election of option (b) of Section 15.4.2, elect to pay the Performance
Liquidated
Damages and achieve Final Completion, pursuant to Section 15.4.2(a) after the expiration of its
previously implemented Remedial Plan if Contractor fails to satisfy the
Performance Guarantees by such date,  based on the most recent
Performance Tests.



15.4.4                Submission
of Remedial Plan.  All Corrective Actions performed after
Substantial Completion shall be performed in accordance with a Remedial Plan
submitted to Owner pursuant to Section 15.4.2(b).



15.4.5                Minimum
Requirements for Remedial Plan.  Each Remedial Plan shall, at a
minimum, specify the Corrective Actions Contractor proposes to take, the
commencement date of the Corrective Action, the component or system that
will be
tested after such Corrective Actions are implemented, the kind of test that
will
be performed on such component or system, and the Benchmark Tests or Performance
Tests.  Contractor will run the tests identified in the Remedial Plan
to demonstrate satisfaction of the relevant Performance Guarantees;
provided, however, that upon the satisfaction of the Performance
Guarantees, Contractor shall be limited to performing three (3) additional
Performance Tests.  The Corrective Actions described in the Remedial
Plan that Contractor proposes to undertake with respect to the Work must
be
designed and intended to cause the Project to satisfy the Performance Guarantees
without negative effects on Acceptance Tests results used to obtain Substantial
Completion, must have a reasonable probability of success, and must not involve
a material risk of damaging or diminishing the performance of any of the
Work.  The projected completion date for such Corrective Action must
fall within the Cure Period.



15.4.6                Approval
of Remedial Plan.  Owner shall, promptly but no later than ten
(10) days after receipt of a Remedial Plan, approve or provide written comments
concerning such plan to Contractor.  Unless Contractor accepts all of
Owner’s comments with respect to such Remedial Plan, Contractor and Owner shall
meet and confer as soon as practicable to discuss the Remedial Plan and Owner’s
comments thereto.  Contractor and Owner shall then






EXECUTION
COPY







69

















endeavor
to come to an agreement on the Remedial Plan.  If either Contractor or
Owner determines, after using its reasonable efforts to come to an agreement
on
a proposed Remedial Plan, that such an agreement cannot be reached, then
such
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Article 32.  If in any dispute between Owner
and Contractor regarding the approval of a proposed Remedial Plan it is
determined that Owner’s failure to approve a proposed Remedial Plan was in
violation of this Agreement, Contractor’s sole remedy for such violation shall
be an equitable extension of the Cure Period, and such failure shall not
otherwise be considered a breach of any covenant, condition, representation
or
warranty of Owner, and shall not be construed as an Owner Event of
Default.



15.4.7                Prosecution
of Remedial Plan.  Upon satisfaction of the conditions of
Section 15.4.6, Contractor
shall:



(a)           promptly
and diligently pursue completion of the Remedial Plan at Contractor’s sole
cost;



(b)           in
performing the Corrective Action described in the Remedial Plan, neither
cause
the Project to be unable to satisfy the Emission Guarantees, nor cause the
Project to be unable to comply with Applicable Laws; and



(c)           make
substantial and demonstrable progress toward completion the Remedial Plan
in
accordance with its terms.



15.4.8                Additional
Remedial Plans.  If Contractor is unable to satisfy the
Performance Guarantees after completing the initial Remedial Plan, Contractor
may deliver a new Remedial Plan to Owner within ten (10) days after completion
of such initial Remedial Plan; provided that the Cure Period has not or
will not expire during the period covered by such new Remedial
Plan.



15.4.9                Access
During Cure Period.  Upon Owner’s approval of the Remedial Plan
submitted pursuant to Section 15.4.2(b), Contractor shall be granted
reasonable access to the Project, subject to Section 15.4.12, for the period as set forth
in the
Remedial Plan approved by Owner, to:



(a)           perform
Corrective Actions pursuant to a Remedial Plan prepared and prosecuted in
accordance with Section 15.4.5;
and



(b)           re-perform
the applicable Benchmark Tests or Performance Tests as approved by
Owner;



all
in order to improve the performance results of the Project and to reduce
Contractor’s liability for amounts payable as Performance Liquidated Damages or
to establish the basis for any performance bonuses pursuant to
Section 5.4.1.  The
Net Capacity and Net Heat Rate shall be adjusted to the amounts determined
by
such Performance Tests.  Contractor shall keep Owner continuously
apprised of the specific schedule, and changes therein, including the scheduled
commencement and re-performance of the applicable Benchmark Tests or Performance
Tests.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Contractor
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Contractor’s
performance of any Correction Action during the Cure Period






EXECUTION
COPY







70

















does
not result in the Project operating at a level lower than the initial
performance upon Substantial Completion.



15.4.10                      Payment
of Performance Liquidated Damages or Performance Bonuses.  At the
end of the Cure Period, the results of the most recently completed Benchmark
or
Performance Tests shall be used to calculate the Performance Liquidated Damages
or performance bonuses, as applicable.  Contractor shall provide Owner
with all required test data and Owner shall calculate the Performance Liquidated
Damages or performance bonuses, as applicable.  In the event any
Performance Liquidated Damages have been paid pursuant to Section 15.8, Owner shall recalculate the
Performance
Liquidated Damages or performance bonus, as applicable, and:



(a)           if
Contractor does not meet the Performance Guarantees and Performance Liquidated
Damages are less than the Performance Liquidated Damages calculated pursuant
to
Section 15.8,  Owner
shall notify Contractor and refund the difference thereof to Contractor within
five (5) Business Days;



(b)           if
Contractor does not meet the Performance Guarantees and Performance Liquidated
Damages are greater than the Performance Liquidated Damages calculated pursuant
to Section 15.8, Owner shall
notify Contractor and Contractor shall pay the difference thereof to Owner
within five (5) Business Days after Contractor receives a Notice for such
payment from Owner; or



(c)           subject
to Section 5.5.2, if the
recalculated performance exceeds the Performance Guarantees, any performance
bonuses shall be calculated pursuant to Section 5.5.2.



In
the event that Owner approves the
Remedial Plan pursuant to Section 15.8, and at the end of the Cure
Period (i) the
Project does not meet the Performance Guarantees, Contractor shall pay the
applicable Performance Liquidated Damages calculated pursuant to
Section 15.3 or (ii) the Project
exceeds the Performance Guarantees, any performance bonuses shall be calculated
pursuant to Section 5.5.2.



15.4.11                      Contractor’s
Buy-Down Option.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, during the
Cure Period, Contractor may, by Notice to Owner, elect to calculate the
Performance Liquidated Damages based on the then most recently completed
Performance Tests and pay any applicable Performance Liquidated Damages rather
than attempt further Corrective Action.



15.4.12                      Operation
During Cure Period.  Upon the earlier of Substantial Completion or
the date this Agreement is terminated, Owner shall assume care, custody and
control of the Project in accordance with Section 18.4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
during the Cure Period, Owner shall provide Contractor with reasonable access
to
the Project as and to the extent provided in Section 15.4.12.1 at such time or times as Owner
shall
approve.  During the Cure Period, Owner shall have the right to
operate the Project in its sole discretion, including the right to maximize
the
economic benefits of the Project.  Contractor understands and accepts
that the desire of Owner to maximize the economic benefits of the Project
likely
will curtail Contractor’s freedom of action during the Cure Period and Owner
will likely not provide access

to
the Project to Contractor for any significant modifications during the period
from June 1 through September 30 of any year.  Except as set forth in
the next sentence, any failure by Owner to provide Contractor with access
to the
Project as set forth in this Section 15.4.12 shall not be considered a
breach of any
covenant, condition, representation or warranty of Owner, and shall not be
construed as an Owner Event of Default.  Contractor’s only remedy for
a failure by Owner to provide Contractor with access to the Project as set
forth
in this Section 15.4.12 shall be
an equitable extension of the Cure Period until such reasonable access is
provided.



15.4.12.1                      Shut
Downs During Cure Period.  After Substantial Completion, Owner and
Contractor agree to cooperate in good faith in determining when and to what
extent the Project will be taken out of service in order to make Corrective
Actions to improve the performance of the Project and to minimize the periods
of
time when the Project will be taken out of service or Contractor will be
permitted to perform any Benchmark Tests or Performance Tests or conduct
Corrective Actions that require any material limitation on Owner’s operation of
the Project (each such period, an “Outage Period”);
provided, that Contractor shall use its best efforts to
conduct such
Corrective Actions during periods when the Project is undergoing scheduled
maintenance outages.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractor will
have the right to at least two (2) Outage Periods, each not to exceed ten
(10)
consecutive days, which periods shall be scheduled in consultation with Owner;
provided that any additional Outage Periods shall be subject to Owner’s
approval which may be withheld in Owner’s sole
discretion.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless
Owner expressly agrees otherwise (which agreement may be withheld in Owner’s
sole discretion), no Outage Period shall be scheduled during the period from
June 1 through September 30 of any year.



15.4.12.2                      Outage
Periods.  Each Outage Period will begin after a twenty four (24)
hour cool down period (if necessary for the Corrective Action) and will end
when
Contractor clears the Project to normal operational conditions and turns
the
Project over to Owner for operation.  For each outage day during the
Cure Period in excess of twenty (20) in the aggregate, Contractor shall pay
Owner an amount per day equal to *** percent (***%) of the average amount
per
day paid to Contractor as a bonus for achieving early Substantial Completion
pursuant to Section 5.5.1 (such
average amount to be calculated by taking the total bonus amount paid to
Contractor and dividing by the sum of (x) the number of days prior to the
Substantial Completion Guaranteed Date that Substantial Completion occurs
less
(y) twenty-nine (29)).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Owner shall
credit Contractor against sums due pursuant to the preceding sentence, one
(1)
outage day for each calendar week that the Substantial Completion Date occurred
earlier than twenty-nine (29) days prior to the Substantial Completion
Guaranteed Date.  Accrued amounts due pursuant to this
Section 15.4.12.2 shall be due
and payable within ten (10) days after Owner provides a Notice to Contractor
demanding payment thereof.  If Owner instructs Contractor to cease
performing a Benchmark Test or Performance Test or conducting Corrective
Actions
during an Outage Period or otherwise during the remainder of the Cure Period
(for reasons other than safety concerns arising from Defects), Contractor
shall
be granted a day for day extension of the Cure Period.

15.5           Offset
and Draws on Security.  If Contractor is obligated to pay any
amount to Owner, as applicable, pursuant to Sections 15.1, 15.2
or 15.3, including any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 15.4, as
applicable, and such amount is not paid within the time period referred to
in
such Section, Owner shall have the right to offset pursuant to Sections
6.6.1 and 6.11
any such amount against any amount then or
thereafter due from Owner to Contractor under this Agreement and to exercise
its
rights against any security provided by or for the benefit of Contractor
in
accordance with Section 6.7.2 or any
other applicable sections of this Agreement, in such order as Owner may elect
in
its sole discretion.



15.6           Sole
Remedy; Liquidated Damages Not a Penalty.  The amounts payable
under Sections 15.1, 15.2
or 15.3, as limited by Article 31,
and the other remedies provided for in this
Article 15 and, if such failure
constitutes a Contractor Event of Default pursuant to Section 19.1(j) or Section 19.1(k),
the remedies provided for in
Sections 19.2(a) through (h),
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of Owner for delays in Substantial Completion, for failure to meet the
Reliability Guarantee and for failure of the Project to meet the Performance
Guarantees (other than the Emissions Guarantees) during the Acceptance
Tests.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT OWNER’S ACTUAL DAMAGES, AS
APPLICABLE, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH DELAYS OR FAILURES WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE.  ALTHOUGH OWNER’S ESTIMATE OF
ITS
DAMAGES,
INCLUDING THE LOSS OF OPERATING REVENUE AND
OTHER OPERATING AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND CHARGES IN
THE EVENT OF SUCH DELAYS OR FAILURES SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF
THE
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVIDED HEREIN, AFTER NEGOTIATION, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED
TO AMOUNTS THAT REPRESENT EACH OF THE DELAY LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, THE RELIABILITY
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND THE PERFORMANCE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, AND THAT SUCH
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES ARE IN THE NATURE OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, AND NOT A
PENALTY.



15.7           Enforceability.  The
Parties explicitly agree and intend that the provisions of this
Article 15 shall be fully
enforceable by any court exercising jurisdiction over any dispute between
the
Parties arising under this Agreement.  CONTRACTOR
AND OWNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY DEFENSES
AVAILABLE TO
THEM UNDER LAW OR EQUITY RELATING TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS
ARTICLE 15.



15.8           Extension
of Cure Period.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
in the event Contractor has been unable to meet the Performance Guarantees
on or
prior to the expiration of the initial one hundred eight (180) day Cure Period
after fulfilling its obligations contained in Sections 15.4.7 and 15.4.9,
Contractor may submit to Owner for
approval a revised Remedial Plan meeting the requirements of
Section 15.4.5, but setting
forth in specificity and detail Corrective Action(s) which Contractor proposes
to undertake to enable the Project to achieve the Performance
Guarantees.  Upon Owner’s approval of such revised Remedial Plan, not
to be unreasonably withheld, the Cure Period shall be extended for the period
of
time set forth in the Remedial Plan approved by Owner, but in no event for
more
than one hundred eighty

(180)
days.  In the event Owner disagrees that such proposed Remedial Plan
will enable the Project to achieve the Performance Guarantees, then Owner
shall
notify Contractor in writing of same, whereupon Contractor may pay the
Performance Liquidated Damages due and owing to Owner pursuant to
Section 15.3 and extend the Cure
Period for the period of time set forth in the Remedial Plan submitted to
Owner
for approval, such period in no event to exceed one hundred eighty (180)
days.



16.           CHANGES
IN THE WORK



16.1           Change
In Work.  A change in Work (each, a “Change In
Work”) may result only from any of the following:



(a)           Changes
in the Work required by Owner in writing, including an acceleration of Work
in
accordance with Section 7.7;



(b)           the
occurrence of an Excusable Event (as and only to the extent permitted by
Section 8.6.2);



(c)           the
occurrence of an event of Force Majeure (as and only to the extent permitted
by
Section 8.6.1);



(d)           an
Owner Directive, in accordance with Section 16.7;



(e)           in
accordance with Section 24.4;



(f)           in
accordance with Exhibit B; or



(g)           in
accordance with Exhibit I.



16.2           By
Owner.  Owner shall have the right to make changes in the Work,
within the general scope thereof, whether such changes are modifications,
accelerations, alterations, additions, or deletions.  All such changes
shall be made in accordance with this Article 16, be documented in accordance
with
Section 16.4 and shall be
considered, for all purposes of this Agreement, as part of the
Work.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless Contractor and Owner
shall have agreed upon a Change In Work in accordance with the provisions
of
Section 16.4 or Owner shall have
issued an Owner Directive, Contractor shall have no obligation to, and shall
not, perform or comply with any modification, acceleration, alteration,
addition, or deletion to the Work unless required for the safe performance
of
the Work or otherwise in the event of an emergency or as required by Applicable
Law.



16.3           By
Contractor.  Contractor shall be entitled to initiate and submit a
Change In Work Form for approval by Owner only in the event of an Excusable
Event or Force Majeure in accordance with Sections 8.6.1 and 8.6.2
or pursuant to Section 24.4 (but, without limiting any
other provision
hereunder, with respect to Section 24.4, only to the extent Contractor’s
performance hereunder was actually and demonstrably delayed by any delay
in
obtaining any POI Acknowledgement) or pursuant to Exhibits B and
I.

If
Contractor provides Notice of or becomes aware of a Change In Work permitted
pursuant to this Section 16.3,
Contractor shall immediately serve Notice thereof to Owner and Contractor
shall,
as soon as practicable, prepare a Change In Work Form.



16.4           Owner
Initiated Change In Work.  If Owner provides Notice to Contractor
that Owner is proposing a Change In Work, Contractor shall, as soon as
practicable, prepare and deliver to Owner an order of magnitude estimate
of the
costs, if any, expected to be incurred in connection with the proposed Change
In
Work, and an estimate of the change, if any, to the Milestone Schedule or
Project Guaranteed Dates associated with such Change In Work.  If
following review of such preliminary estimates, Owner requests that Contractor
prepare a more detailed estimate, Contractor shall then prepare a detailed
Change In Work Form which shall include, subject to the remaining provisions
of
this Section 16.4, a detailed
proposal for such Change In Work, together with a detailed explanation and
basis
thereof, of:



(a)           the
change, if any, to the Milestone Summary Schedule and the
Project  Guaranteed Dates associated with such Change In
Work;



(b)           the
increase or decrease, if any, in the cost required to complete the Work as
described on the Change In Work Form.



Any
increases in the cost required to complete the Work shall be limited to actual
and demonstrable increases which Contractor was unable to
avoid.  Contractor’s proposed change in the Contract Price for such
Change In Work shall propose a fixed price (with detailed estimates and
quotation backup) which fixed price shall not exceed the difference of the
direct costs (without profit, overhead or contingency) expected to be incurred
by Contractor because of such Change In Work; less any savings expected to
be
realized because of such Change In Work, plus an allowance for profit, overhead,
contingency and escalation, in each case as set forth in a Change In Work
Form;
provided, however, that in no event shall any Change In Work
include any contingency amount related to the Labor Pool (as defined in
Exhibit I).  The adjustment in the Contract Price specified in
this Section 16.4, and
the Project Schedule, as applicable, shall be the sole adjustment related
to a
specific Change In Work Form unless expressly stated otherwise therein or
as may
be provided elsewhere as mutually agreed by Owner and Contractor pursuant
to
Section 33.4.  In the event
that Owner requests that Contractor prepare a Change In Work Form after having
received an order of magnitude estimate of the costs related to such proposed
Change In Work, and thereafter elects not to proceed with such proposed Change
In Work, Owner shall be responsible to reimburse Contractor fifty percent
(50%)
of Contractor’s reasonable costs in preparing such proposed Change In Work
Form.



16.5           Execution
of Change In Work Form.  If Contractor and Owner reach agreement
on the matters listed in the Change In Work Form submitted by Contractor,
Contractor shall execute such Change In Work Form, and Owner shall sign
“Accepted by Owner” on such Change In Work Form and execute such Change In Work
Form (indicating any amendments necessary to reflect the agreement of the
Parties).  If the Parties cannot reach agreement on the matters listed
in the Change In Work Form submitted pursuant to this Section 16.5, subject to the terms of
Section 16.7.2,
then such matter
shall be referred to dispute resolution under Article 32.

16.6           No
Obligation or Payment Without Executed Change In Work Form.  IN NO
EVENT SHALL CONTRACTOR BE ENTITLED TO UNDERTAKE OR BE OBLIGATED TO UNDERTAKE
A
CHANGE IN WORK UNTIL CONTRACTOR HAS RECEIVED A CHANGE IN WORK FORM SUBMITTED
BY
CONTRACTOR AND ACCEPTED BY OWNER AND, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN
SECTION 16.7, OR IN THE EVENT
IMMEDIATE ACTION IS REASONABLY REQUIRED TO ADDRESS AN EMERGENCY WHICH ENDANGERS
HUMAN HEALTH OR PROPERTY, IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH EXECUTED CHANGE IN WORK
FORM,
IF CONTRACTOR UNDERTAKES ANY CHANGES IN THE WORK, CONTRACTOR SHALL MAKE ANY
SUCH
CHANGES AT CONTRACTOR’S SOLE RISK AND EXPENSE AND SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO ANY
SCHEDULE MODIFICATION OR PAYMENT HEREUNDER FOR UNDERTAKING SUCH
CHANGES.  NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 16.6 SHALL BE DEEMED TO WAIVE CONTRACTOR’S OR
OWNER’S RIGHT TO AVAIL ITSELF OF THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES PURSUANT TO
ARTICLE 32 WITH RESPECT TO
DISPUTED CHANGE IN WORK FORMS.



16.7           Owner
Directives.



16.7.1                Non-Major
Change In Work.  If Contractor and Owner are unable to agree on
whether a Change In Work has occurred or on the matters described in a Change
In
Work Form with respect to any Change In Work Form proposing an adjustment
to the
Contract Price equal to or less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000),
whether such Change In Work Form was initiated by Contractor or by Owner,
Contractor shall perform the Work as Owner so directs in writing, unless
the
performance of such a Change In Work affects the safe performance of the
Work or
violates Applicable Law.



16.7.2                Major
Change In Work.  If Contractor and Owner are unable to agree on
any Change In Work Form proposing an adjustment to Contract Price in excess
of
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (such Change In Work as proposed,
a
“Major Change In Work”), whether such Major Change In Work was
initiated by Contractor or by Owner, Contractor and Owner shall engage in
an
open book review process in order to finalize the adjustment to Contract
Price
and the Milestone Summary Schedule, if any, associated with such Major Change
In
Work.  During such open book review process, Contractor shall make
details of the estimate buildup, including estimated quantities and subtotals
for the labor, subcontracts and Equipment and Materials costs available for
Owner’s review relating to such Major Change In Work.  In addition,
Contractor shall demonstrate the basis for the increase to Contract Price
and
the Milestone Summary Schedule included in such Major Change In
Work.  If Owner and Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the
Major Change In Work during such open book review process, Contractor shall
perform the Work as Owner so directs in writing, unless the performance of
such
a Change In Work affects the safe performance of the Work or violates Applicable
Law.



16.7.3                Prosecution
of Owner Directive.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that Contractor reasonably believes that any Change In Work so directed in
writing by Owner would result in a Defect, Contractor shall promptly provide
Notice of same to Owner, which such Notice shall set forth a detailed
explanation and basis for Contractor’s belief and Contractor shall not be
required to perform such Change In Work except as Contractor and






EXECUTION
COPY







76

















Owner,
negotiating in good faith, mutually agree.  Subject to the foregoing,
notwithstanding any such Notice provided by Contractor, Contractor shall
otherwise proceed with the Work.



16.7.4                Pricing
of Changes In Work Related to Owner Directives.  In the event
Contractor performs Work as directed by Owner pursuant to
Sections 16.7.1 or 16.7.2
(each an “Owner
Directive”), and such Owner Directive results (a) in an increase to the
direct costs (without profit, overhead or contingency) expected to be incurred
by Contractor because of such Owner Directive, Owner shall pay to Contractor
the
amount of actually incurred costs of labor and materials incurred by Contractor
in connection with Work performed pursuant to such Owner Directive, plus
***
(***) of such amount representing a reasonable interim amount for Contractor’s
overhead and profit or (b) in savings to direct costs expected to be realized
because of such Owner Directive, Contractor shall reduce the Contract Price
by
the amount of such savings, plus *** (***) of such amount representing a
reasonable interim amount for Contractor’s overhead and profit.  Any
disputes regarding the pricing of a Change In Work or Major Change In Work
or
that are otherwise related to an Owner Directive shall be subject to the
dispute
resolution provisions of Article 32, but if such Change In Work
constitutes a
Major Change In Work, disputes regarding such Major Change In Work shall
be
subject to such dispute resolution procedures only after following the open
book
review process described in Section 16.7.2.



16.7.5                True-Up.  If
following resolution of a dispute pursuant to the provisions contained in
Article 32 it is determined that
the amounts paid to Contractor pursuant to Section 16.7.4:  (a) are less than the
amounts that Owner should have paid based upon the Work performed pursuant
to an
Owner Directive, then Owner shall pay to Contractor such deficiency (with
interest at the Contract Interest Rate from the date payment for such Work
was
due and not paid) within ten (10) days after Notice of such deficiency from
Contractor; or (b) exceed the amounts that Owner should have paid based
upon the Work performed pursuant to an Owner Directive, then Contractor shall
refund to Owner such excess (with interest at the Contract Interest Rate
from
the date payment for such Work was due and not paid) within ten (10) days
after
Notice of such deficiency from Contractor.



16.8           Express
Waiver.  Contractor expressly waives any other compensation for
any Change In Work executed pursuant to a Change in Work Form executed by
Owner
and Contractor pursuant to the provisions of this Article 16, including any other change
in the Milestone
Summary Schedule, the Project Guaranteed Dates or the Contract
Price.  For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent there is a
cumulative effect on the Contract Price or Project Schedule due to more than
one
Change in Work, Contractor shall include the impacts of the accumulation
on the
most current Change In Work Form and shall not be permitted to amend previously
agreed upon Changes in Work Form.



16.9           No
Suspension.  Notwithstanding any dispute between Owner and
Contractor regarding a proposed Change In Work, Owner Directive, Contractor’s
claim regarding the impact of a change upon the Contract Price or whether
a
Change In Work has in fact occurred, Contractor shall not suspend the Work
unless directed by Owner in writing in accordance with Section 20.7, and Owner shall continue
to make payments
to Contractor consistent with the Payment Schedule, pending resolution of
such
dispute.

16.10                      Evidence
of Funds for Payment.  In the event that the cumulative value of
prior Owner-Initiated Changes and Owner Directives, and any other mutually
agreeable Changes In Work exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), Owner
shall
at Contractor’s reasonable request obtain written confirmation from its
Financing Entities or provide written confirmation itself in a form reasonably
acceptable to Contractor that sufficient funds are available to permit payment
for such Changes In Work.  Contractor shall not be obliged to effect
any Change in Work pending receipt of such
confirmation.



16.11                      Change
for Contractor’s Convenience.  Contractor shall have the right to
take any action at its own expense that is generally consistent with this
Agreement and that Contractor in good faith determines to be reasonably
necessary to meet the requirements of this Agreement.  In the event
such action involves substitution of Equipment or Materials as set forth
in this
Agreement or the replacement of Major Subcontractors, or a deletion from,
or
modification of the Work as described in this Agreement or any Contractor
Deliverable, Contractor shall obtain Owner’s written approval, which may be
granted or withheld in Owner’s sole reasonable discretion, prior to undertaking
such action.  Contractor shall not be entitled to any adjustment to
the Contract Price, any Project Guaranteed Date, or any other term or condition
of this Agreement in respect of any action undertaken pursuant to this
Section 16.11.



16.12                      Audit
Rights.  With respect to any Change In Work which adjusts the
Contract Price, or with respect to Work performed pursuant to an Owner’s
Directive, Contractor shall maintain, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied, records and books of
account.  In any case where Contractor is instructed to proceed to
comply with a Change In Work prior to the agreement of the change to the
Contract Price under Article 16,
Contractor shall keep contemporary records of the cost of complying with
the
Change In Work and of time expended thereon.  Contractor shall retain
all such records and books of account for a period of at least two (2) years
after the Final Completion Date.  Contractor shall cause all
Subcontractors engaged in connection with the Work or the performance by
Contractor of its warranty obligations herein to retain for the same period
all
their records relating to the Work.  In the event of a dispute
hereunder in which the cost of the Work relating to a Change In Work or Owner
Directive is in issue and the parties had not previously agreed to a fixed
price
for such Change in Work, Contractor shall grant to Owner the right to conduct
an
audit with respect to all documentation pertaining to such dispute, except
the
compilation of standard costs for: (i) payroll additives for non-manual
employees of Contractor; (ii) normal operating costs of Contractor’s office in
Frederick, Maryland; (iii) costs of ordinary integrated solutions and
technology; (iv) materials, supplies and reproduction supplies; (v) ordinary
communication costs and (vi) non-manual ordinary employee
benefits.  Audit data shall not be released by the auditor to parties
other than Contractor, Owner, the Financing Entities, if any, and their
respective directors, officers, employees, and agents in connection with
any
such audit.  Such records shall be open to inspection by Owner at all
reasonable times.  Subject to agreement of the adjustment to Contract
Price pursuant to a Change In Work Form or the determination of the adjustment
pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures pursuant to Article 32, if, as a result of any audit
conducted
pursuant to this Section 16.12,
the results of such audit indicate that Contractor received more or less
than
the amount to which it was entitled under this Agreement, either Owner shall
pay
the additional amount owed to Contractor or Contractor shall refund any
overpayment to Owner, as applicable, in either case within ten (10) days
of a
written request therefor.  Owner shall be responsible for all costs
and expenses of such audit unless an

overpayment
of five percent (5%) is discovered, in which case Contractor shall be
responsible for such costs and expenses.



17.           WARRANTIES
CONCERNING THE WORK



17.1           Work
Warranty.  Contractor warrants to Owner (the “Work
Warranty”) that all Work (other than Work covered by the Materials
Warranty), including Contractor’s (and its Subcontractor’s) construction and
design of the Project and the installation of the Equipment and
Materials:



(a)           shall
be Industry Grade;



(b)           shall
be free from Defects; and



(c)           shall
conform to all applicable requirements of this Agreement, the then current
drawings and specifications as approved or accepted by Owner, Applicable
Laws
and the Applicable Permits; provided that Contractor’s obligation with
respect to Applicable Laws or Applicable Permits governing emissions from
the
Project is limited to compliance with the Emissions Guarantees.



17.2           Materials
Warranty.  Contractor further warrants that all Equipment and
Materials and other items furnished by Contractor and any Subcontractors
hereunder (the “Materials Warranty”):



(a)           shall
be new and of good and suitable quality when installed;



(b)           shall
conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the then current drawings
and
specifications as approved or accepted by Owner, all Applicable Laws and
the
Applicable Permits, provided that Contractor’s obligation with respect to
Applicable Laws or Applicable Permits governing emissions from the Project
is
limited to compliance with the Emissions Guarantees;



(c)           shall
be free from any charge, lien, security interest or other encumbrance;
and



(d)           shall
be free of any Defects including Defects in design, materials or fabrication,
or
excessive wear and tear.



Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Contractor proposes to incorporate any used
Equipment and Materials into the Project, Contractor shall provide prior
written
request thereof to Owner, for Owner’s approval, which may be withheld in Owner’s
sole discretion.  If reasonably requested by Owner due to concerns
that any Work or Equipment and Materials may not satisfy the Work Warranty
or
the Materials Warranty, Contractor shall promptly provide Owner with reasonable
evidence that such item(s) of the Work or Equipment and Materials do satisfy
the
Work Warranty or Materials Warranty, as applicable.



17.3           Warranty
Period.  Contractor shall have no liability under
Section 17.1 or 17.2
from and after the end of the twelve (12)
month period commencing on the Substantial






EXECUTION
COPY







79

















Completion
Date (the “Warranty Period”); provided, however,
that the Warranty Period for any Work, Equipment and Materials, item or part
required to be re-performed, repaired, corrected or replaced following discovery
of a Defect during the original Warranty Period shall be extended from the
time
of such re-performance, repair, correction or replacement for a period equal
to
the original Warranty Period for such item or part; provided,
further, subject to Section 17.7.5, the Warranty
Period as extended for any
Work, item or part shall not extend for more than twelve (12) months after
the
end of the initial Warranty Period.



17.4           Enforcement
by Owner.  Commencing on the expiration of the applicable Warranty
Period, Owner shall be entitled to enforce all representations, warranties,
and
guarantees with respect to the Project from Subcontractors, and Contractor
shall
provide reasonable assistance to Owner in enforcing such representations,
warranties, and guarantees, when and as reasonably requested by
Owner.  Owner shall reimburse Contractor for reasonable expenses
incurred by Contractor in complying with such requests from Owner.  In
addition, prior to the expiration of the applicable Warranty Period, Owner,
at
its option and upon prior written Notice to Contractor, may enforce the
particular warranty, the Work Warranty or the Materials Warranty against
any
Subcontractor if:



(a)           Owner
reasonably determines that Contractor has not enforced such warranty against
the
Subcontractor or Contractor has not performed the warranty work itself and
is
not diligently pursuing the satisfaction of such warranty claim, or



(b)           a
Contractor Event of Default exists and Owner has terminated the
Agreement.



17.5           Exclusions.  The
Work Warranty and Materials Warranty set forth in Sections 17.1 and 17.2
shall not apply to:



(a)           Damage
to any Equipment and Materials to the extent such damage is caused
by:



(i)           a
material failure by Owner to operate and maintain such Equipment and Materials
in accordance with Industry Standards or in accordance with the recommendations
set forth in the Required Manuals but only if such failure occurs after
Substantial Completion, or with respect to failures prior to Substantial
Completion such failures are due to the Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct
of Operating Personnel;



(ii)           operation
of such Equipment and Materials by Owner materially in excess of operating
specifications for such Equipment and Materials as set forth in the Required
Manuals but only if such failure occurs after Substantial Completion, or
with
respect to failures prior to Substantial Completion such failures are due
to the
Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct of Operating Personnel;



(iii)           the
use of spare parts and normal consumables by Owner in the repair or maintenance
of such Equipment and Materials that are not materially in accordance with
specifications and recommendations set forth in the Required Manuals but
only if
such failure occurs after Substantial Completion, or with respect to failures
prior to Substantial






EXECUTION
COPY







80

















Completion
such failures are due to the Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct of Operating
Personnel; or



(iv)           an
event of Force Majeure.



(b)           Normal
Operating Consumables or items that require replacement due to normal wear
and
tear or casualty loss (other than as a result of any failure of the Work
Warranty or the Materials Warranty).



Notwithstanding
the foregoing, damage caused by Operating Personnel while under the direction
of
Contractor (except to the extent such damage results from actions of Operating
Personnel constituting Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct) shall be the
responsibility of Contractor.



17.6           Subcontractor
Warranties.  Contractor shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain warranties for all Work performed by each Subcontractor on
substantially the same terms as this Article 17.  Contractor shall assign all
representations, warranties, guarantees, and obligations of all Subcontractors,
at the request and direction of Owner, and without recourse to Contractor,
to
Owner or any Financing Entity upon termination or expiration of this Agreement;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding such assignment,
Contractor shall, subject to Section 17.4, be entitled to enforce each
such
representation, warranty, guarantee, and obligation through the end of the
Warranty Period.  In addition, Contractor hereby assigns to Owner,
effective as of the end of the Warranty Period, all remaining representations,
warranties, guarantees and obligations of all Subcontractors, excluding any
rights to liquidated damages provided for in a subcontract or purchase order
that have not been paid and that are the subject of a claim by Contractor
against a Subcontractor or any other claims of Contractor against
any  Subcontractor then currently in dispute.  Contractor
shall deliver to Owner promptly following execution thereof applicable sections
of purchase orders or subcontracts with Major Subcontractors containing such
representations, warranties and indemnities.




17.7           Correction
of Defects.



17.7.1                Notice
of Warranty Claim.  Subject to Section 17.7.5, Owner shall provide
Notice to
Contractor within a reasonable period after discovery that any of the Work
fails
to satisfy the Work Warranty or the Materials Warranty during the applicable
Warranty Period.  Contractor shall, at Contractor’s own cost and
expense (including overtime, but excluding insurance proceeds to the extent
actually received), re-perform any necessary engineering and purchasing
relating
to such Work, and shall pay the cost of removing any Defect and the cost
of
re-performing, repairing, replacing or testing such subject Work, including
any
damage to the surrounding Work (subject to the limitations provided in
Section 22.2), as shall be
necessary to cause the Work and the Project to conform to the Work Warranty
or
Materials Warranty.  In addition, subject to the limitations provided
in Section 22.2, Contractor
shall, at its own cost and expense (including overtime, but excluding insurance
proceeds to the extent actually received), repair and replace any portion
of the
Work that is damaged or destroyed because any of the Work shall fail to
satisfy
the Work Warranty or the Materials Warranty during the applicable Warranty
Period, all in accordance with the Warranty Procedures.  Within a
reasonable time not to exceed thirty (30) days after receipt by Contractor
of a
Notice from






EXECUTION

81

















Owner
specifying a failure of any of the Work to satisfy Contractor’s Work Warranty or
the Materials Warranty and requesting Contractor to correct the failure,
Contractor and Owner shall mutually agree when and how Contractor shall
remedy
such failure (the “Warranty Procedures”).  Any such
remediation or repair shall be subject to Owner’s approval.  No such
remediation or repair shall be considered complete until Owner shall have
reviewed and approved such remedial work.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing and subject to Section 17.7.2.2, if any of the Work shall
fail to
satisfy Contractor’s Work Warranty or the Materials Warranty, and such failure
endangers human health or property or materially and adversely affects
the
operation of the Project, Contractor shall correct the failure as soon
as is
reasonably practicable.



17.7.2                 Owner
Performance.



17.7.2.1                      Upon
Contractor’s Request.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractor
may request Owner to perform all or any portion of Contractor’s obligations with
respect to any warranty claim.  Owner may elect to perform such
obligations in Owner’s sole discretion, and, if Owner elects not to perform such
obligations, Contractor shall remain obligated to and shall perform such
obligations.  Owner may prepare and deliver an invoice to Contractor,
accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation, setting forth the cost
of
such Work performed by Owner.  Upon receipt thereof, Contractor shall
reimburse Owner for all costs and expenses incurred by Owner (including
costs
related to Owner’s personnel) to perform Contractor’s obligations with respect
to such warranty claim within ten (10) days of receiving Owner’s request for
payment of such costs.



17.7.2.2                      Failure
of Contractor to Perform Warranty Work.  If Contractor does not
use its reasonable efforts to proceed to complete the Work required to
satisfy
any warranty claim within the agreed time and Contractor is not diligently
pursuing the satisfaction of such warranty claim, or if Contractor and
Owner
fail to reach such an agreement within the period as set forth in
Section 17.7.1, Owner shall have
the right after further Notice to Contractor to perform the necessary remedy,
or
have third-parties perform the necessary remedy and Contractor shall reimburse
Owner for the costs thereof upon delivery by Owner of a reasonably detailed
invoice, accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation, setting forth
such
costs.  In the event any of the Work fails to satisfy the Work
Warranty or the Materials Warranty during the applicable Warranty Period
and any
such failure occurs under circumstances in which there is an immediate
need for
repairs, Owner may perform such warranty work for Contractor’s account;
provided that Owner provides reasonably prompt Notice to Contractor of
such immediate need.  For purposes of clarity, no warranty Work shall
be re-warranted which is completed after the expiry of the Warranty Period
and
no claims for Warranty work shall be made after the expiry of the Warranty
Period except in respect of warranty related work which has not been completed
and of which Contractor was given notice within the Warranty
Period.



17.7.3                Equipment
and Materials Testing and Demonstrations.  If, during the Warranty
Period, Contractor changes, repairs or replaces any Equipment and Materials,
Owner and Contractor shall establish performance criteria and any test
or
functional demonstration procedures to be performed by Contractor to demonstrate
the proper functioning of such repaired or replaced Equipment and Materials
to
Owner’s reasonable satisfaction.






EXECUTION
COPY







82






















17.7.4                Chronic
Failure.  Should Contractor fail to correct any Defect in any
Work, Equipment and Materials, items or parts, and such failure occurs
more than
twice during the Warranty Period, Contractor shall prepare a root cause
analysis, reasonably acceptable to Owner, that defines the changes, repairs
or
replacements to the Work, Materials and Equipment, item or part necessary
to
avoid further failures of such Work, Materials and Equipment, items or
part, and
shall perform and complete all changes, repairs or replacements indicated
in
such root cause analysis, regardless of whether the Warranty Period, as
extended
pursuant to Section 17.3, shall
have expired.  In each case, Contractor shall repeat such process on
an iterative basis until the Defect is corrected.



17.7.5                Owner’s
Warranty Option.  Owner and Contractor acknowledge and agree that
it may be impracticable or otherwise not in Owner’s best interest to re-perform
any Work or fix any Defective Equipment and Materials which fails to satisfy
the
Work Warranty or Materials Warranty.  Such impracticability may be due
to, among other things, considerations concerning the length of time the
Project
may be shutdown in order to re-perform such nonconforming Work or risks
to the
other portions of the Project as a result of such re-performance.  As
a consequence thereof, the Parties expressly agree that in lieu of re-performing
any Work so as to cause the Project to satisfy the Work Warranty and Materials
Warranty, Owner shall have the option (the “Warranty Payment
Option”) (which option Owner shall exercise (if at all) by Notice to
Contractor within ten (10) days after Owner initially Notifies Contractor
of
such non-conforming Work to cause Contractor (so long as Contractor has
not
commenced the Work on the Project Site to fix such Defective Equipment
and
Materials) to pay to Owner, in lieu of re-performing such Work, an amount
equal
to an estimate mutually determined by Owner and Contractor of the cost
to
Contractor to re-perform any necessary engineering and purchasing relating
to
such non-conforming Work, plus the cost of removing any non-conforming
Work and
the cost of re-performing, repairing or replacing such subject Work, all
as
would be necessary to cause the Work and or the applicable Equipment and
Materials to conform to the Work Warranty and Materials Warranty.  If
Owner exercises its Warranty Payment Option with respect to any non-conforming
Work, Contractor shall pay all such costs to Owner within ten (10) days
after
agreement upon costs (or resolution of any disputed costs) with
Owner.  If Owner exercises its Warranty Payment Option with respect to
any non-conforming Work, and Contractor pays all such costs with respect
to such
non-conforming Work, Contractor’s warranty obligations hereunder with respect to
such non-conforming Work shall be deemed satisfied.



17.8           Limitations
on Warranties.  EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND
REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION 4.1, THIS ARTICLE 17
AND SECTION 25.4, CONTRACTOR DOES NOT MAKE
ANY OTHER
EXPRESS WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS, OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE.  THE REMEDIES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS
ARTICLE 17 WITH RESPECT TO ANY
WORK WHICH FAILS TO SATISFY THE WORK WARRANTY OR THE MATERIALS WARRANTY
DURING
THE WARRANTY PERIOD SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR OWNER
AS A
RESULT OF SUCH FAILURE; PROVIDED THAT IF SUCH FAILURE CONSTITUTES A
CONTRACTOR EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER SECTION 19.1(F), THE REMEDIES PROVIDED
FOR IN
SECTIONS 19.2(A) THROUGH (H)
SHALL ALSO BE AVAILABLE.

an Acceleration
Plan pursuant to Section 7.5,

failure of the Project to satisfy the conditions in Section 14.4.



For
the avoidance of doubt, Owner may not terminate this Agreement as a result
of
the failure of the Project to satisfy the Performance Guarantees or the
Reliability Guarantee, unless Contractor fails to pay liquidated damages
for
which it is liable as provided in Articles 14 and 15,
subject to the limits of liability set out in Article 31 or achieve any Project Schedule
Milestone
other than the Project Guaranteed Dates.



19.2           Owner’s
Rights and Remedies.  In the event of a Contractor Event of
Default Owner or its assignees shall, subject to Section 31.2, have only the following
rights and
remedies and may elect to pursue any or all of them, and Contractor shall
have
the following obligations:



(a)           Owner,

Notice of termination to Contractor immediately upon the occurrence of
such a
Contractor Event of Default, and all amounts owing by Contractor to Owner
hereunder shall immediately become due and payable;

completion of the Work, and in connection therewith Contractor authorizes
Owner
and its respective agents to use such information in completing the Work,
shall
remove such materials, equipment, tools, and instruments used by and any

and
Owner may take possession of any or all Contractor Deliverables and Project
Site
facilities related to the Work (whether or not such Contractor Deliverables
and
Project Site facilities are complete) or leased equipment necessary for
completion of the Work to the extent Owner has agreed to assume in writing
any
lease of Contractor related to such equipment necessary for completion
of the
Work (in which event Contractor shall cooperate with Owner to cause such
obligations to be assigned by Contractor to and assumed by Owner);

without incurring any liability to Contractor, shall have the right to
have the
Work finished whether by enforcing any security given by or for the benefit

without limiting Owner’s right to terminate this Agreement, may seek equitable
relief to enforce the provisions of this Agreement;

Default, Owner may terminate this Agreement by delivery of written notice
to
Contractor, and, subject to Article 31, Contractor shall be liable
to Owner for the
actual costs of completing the Work, including compensation for obtaining
a
replacement contractor or for obtaining additional professional services
required as a consequence of Contractor’s Event of Default, in excess of those
costs that would have been payable to Contractor but for such Contractor’s Event
of Default (and, to the extent applicable, Contractor shall remain liable
for
the satisfaction of all liabilities incurred prior to Owner’s termination
(including Contractor’s indemnification obligations hereunder and payment of all
Delay Liquidated Damages accrued as of the date of termination, but excluding
Reliability Liquidated Damages and Performance Liquidated
Damages)).  In addition, whether or not Owner terminates the
Agreement, in the event of a Contractor Event of Default, Owner shall be
entitled to withhold further payments to Contractor for the Work performed

Contractor, if any, under this Section 19.3.  Upon determination of the
total cost of the Work, Owner shall notify Contractor in writing of the amount,
if any, that Contractor shall pay Owner or Owner shall pay
Contractor.  Contractor acknowledges that in the event of such a
termination, Owner may enter into a turnkey contract for the completion
of the
Project with substantially similar or more favorable performance guarantees,
completion deadlines and liquidated damages as are provided for in this
Agreement, that such turnkey contract may require the replacement contractor
to
perform all such work on an accelerated basis, and that, as a result thereof,
the cost to complete the Project may greatly exceed the cost
hereunder.  Contractor

acknowledges
and agrees that if this Agreement is terminated due to a Contractor Event
of
Default, Owner shall have no obligation and shall not be required to mitigate
any damages or costs it incurs in completing the Project.  If it is
determined for any reason that Contractor was not in default or that its
default
was excusable or that Owner was not entitled to the remedy against Contractor
provided above, the termination will be deemed to be a termination for
convenience pursuant to Section 20.1, and Contractor’s sole and exclusive
remedies whether in tort, contract or otherwise against Owner shall be
the same
as and shall be strictly limited to those afforded in Section 20.1.  Nothing in this paragraph
shall be deemed to modify the provisions of Article 31.

20.           TERMINATION
AND SUSPENSION



20.1           Termination
for Convenience; Payment.  Owner may in its sole discretion
terminate the Work with or without cause at any time by giving prior Notice
of
termination to Contractor, to be effective upon the receipt of such Notice
by
Contractor or upon such later termination date specifically identified
by Owner
therein; provided, however, that Owner shall not terminate the
Work for the sole purpose of substituting a replacement
contractor.  Subject to the limitations of Section 31.4, if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant
to this Section 20.1 on or after
the date hereof, as compensation for the Work performed through the effective
date of termination, subject to reductions as set in this paragraph below,
Owner
shall pay to Contractor an amount equal to the sum of (a) portions of the
Contract Price for the Work performed up to the effective date of termination
(including any bonuses earned and payable to Contractor pursuant to
Section 5.5.1 or 5.5.2),
and, to the extent not already
incorporated in the Contract Price pursuant to an approved Change in Work
Form,
amounts associated with Exhibits B and I); plus (b) Contractor’s
reasonable incurred out-of-pocket- costs of demobilization (as evidenced
by
reasonable supporting documentation); plus (c) an amount equal to the sum
of the amount set forth on the Cancellation Cost Schedule corresponding
to the
month in which such termination occurs plus any taxes to be paid by Owner
pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent any portion of such amount has
not
already been incorporated under subsection (a) above; less (d) any amounts
previously paid to Contractor under this Agreement.  Owner shall make
payments under this Section 20.1
in accordance with Article 6.  Upon payment to Contractor,
Owner
and Contractor shall be released from further obligation or liability hereunder
(except for those obligations and liabilities which expressly survive such
termination).






EXECUTION

89






















20.2           Limitation
on Payment.  Except as provided in Section 20.1, Contractor shall not
be entitled to any
lost profit or overhead upon any termination of this Agreement.



20.3           Adjustment
for Defects.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount owed
pursuant to Section 20.1 shall
be subject to adjustment to the extent any Work contains Defects as of
such
termination date; provided that for purposes of clarity any incomplete
Work on the date of termination shall not be deemed to contain any Defects
due
to it being incomplete.



20.4           Owner’s
Right to Elect to Assume Obligations with Subcontractors.  In
addition, upon termination, Owner shall have the right, at its sole option,
to
assume and become liable for any written obligations and commitments that
Contractor may have in good faith undertaken with third-parties in connection
with the Work to be performed at the Project Site.  If Owner elects to
assume any obligation of Contractor as described in this Section 20.4, then (a) the amount paid pursuant
to
Section 20.1 shall
be reduced by the amount of such obligations and commitments (unless they
relate to termination or demobilization costs or to payments due for work
already completed for which Contractor remains obligated to pay);
(b) Contractor shall execute all assignments or other documents and take
all other reasonable steps requested by Owner which may be required to
vest in
Owner all rights, set-offs, benefits and titles necessary to such assumption
by
Owner; (c) Contractor’s satisfaction of its obligations under this
Section 20.4 shall
be a condition precedent to Owner’s obligation to comply with its obligations
under Section 20.1 (including
its obligation to make any payment to Contractor); and (d) Owner shall
simultaneously agree to indemnify Contractor against liabilities thereafter
arising under the assumed obligations or commitments.



20.5           Contractor
Conduct.  Upon receipt of written notice from Owner of termination
pursuant to Section 20.1,
Contractor shall: (a) cease operations as directed by Owner in the notice;
(b) take action necessary, or that Owner may direct, for the protection and
preservation of the Work and the Project; and (c) except for Work directed
to be performed prior to the effective date of termination stated in notice,
for
Work that must necessarily be performed in order for Contractor to close
out the
Project in a prudent manner, or except as expressly requested by Owner
in
writing, terminate all existing subcontracts and purchase orders and enter
into
no further subcontracts or purchase orders with respect to the Work or
the
Project.



20.6           Nature
of Termination Payments.  The payments described in
Section 20.1 include payment for
all costs of Equipment and Materials, including breakage costs or termination
fees incurred by Contractor upon termination of Equipment and Materials
purchase
agreements or purchase orders, temporary equipment, labor, transportation,
engineering, design and other services relating to Contractor’s performance of
its obligations under this Agreement and said Owner-requested Work (including
any intellectual property rights licensed under this Agreement, expressly
or by
implication) provided by Contractor or such
Subcontractors.  Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement,
Owner shall remain obligated to pay such taxes as may become due that are
otherwise payable by Owner pursuant to this Agreement.  The
above-described payments shall not be increased with respect to any of
the
foregoing or with respect to any withholdings in respect of any of the
foregoing
items that Owner may be required to make.

20.7           Suspension
by Owner.  Owner may suspend performance of the Work at any time
by giving prior Notice thereof to Contractor.  Such suspension shall
continue for the period specified in the suspension
Notice.



20.7.1                Adjustments
Due to Suspension.  The Contract Price shall be adjusted as
provided in Section 20.7.3(b) to
reflect any additional increased costs of Contractor resulting from any
such
suspension, as demonstrated by Contractor to Owner’s reasonable satisfaction;
provided, however, no adjustment shall be made to the Contract
Price or any Project Guaranteed Date for a Suspension for Cause.  At
any time after the effective date of the suspension, Owner may require
Contractor to resume performance of the Work on seven (7) days prior
Notice.  Owner acknowledges that Contractor shall not in all cases be
successful in obtaining agreement from the Vendors or Major Subcontractors
supplying major pieces of Equipment to the Project to suspend the manufacture
and delivery of such major Equipment and Materials and that a suspension
by
Owner under this Section 20.7

lost or damaged after the Turnover Date due to any act or omission or negligence
of Contractor, any Affiliate of Contractor or any Subcontractor, or anyone
directly or indirectly employed by any of them, or anyone for whose acts
such
Person may be liable, Contractor shall bear all of the cost and expense
of
replacing or repairing such loss or damage; provided, however,
that if such loss or damage is covered by the property insurance required
to be
maintained by Owner pursuant to Section 21.10.2, Contractor’s liability for replacing
or repairing such loss or damage shall be limited in amount to an amount
equal
to Owner’s applicable insurance deductible not to exceed Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) for each occurrence.  In no event shall Contractor or any

EARLIER TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR A PERIOD EXPIRING FIVE (5) YEARS
FOLLOWING THE FINAL COMPLETION DATE OR SAID TERMINATION, WHICHEVER FIRST
OCCURS.  ALL CLAIM NOTICES MUST BE DELIVERED, IF AT ALL, TO THE
APPLICABLE PARTY PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF SUCH FIVE (5) YEAR
PERIOD.  IF ANY CLAIM NOTICE IS MADE WITHIN SUCH FIVE (5) YEAR PERIOD,
THEN THE INDEMNIFYING PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS IDENTIFIED IN SUCH
CLAIM
NOTICE (AND THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATION OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER WITH RESPECT

24.           TREATMENT
OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION



24.1           Confidential
Information.  Any Confidential Information is disclosed in
confidence, and the transferee shall restrict its use of such information
solely
to uses related to the Project or performance of this Agreement (the
“Intended Purposes”) and shall not use the Confidential
Information in any way detrimental to the transferor or its stockholders,
including, without limitation, to gain a competitive advantage with the
businesses of the transferor.  The transferee shall not, (i) with
respect to Confidential Information other than Proprietary Operating
Information, for a period of five (5) years, and (ii) with  respect to
Proprietary Operating Information, for a period of twenty (20) years, publish
or
otherwise disclose any Confidential Information received to others without
the
prior written approval of the transferor, including the fact that the
Confidential Information has been made available to the transferee, that
it has
entered into this Agreement, or any of the terms, conditions, or other
facts
with respect to this Agreement.  Each Party shall disclose only such
Confidential Information to those of its Representatives (defined below)
as is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and shall inform
its
Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information
and
cause each such Representative to abide by the terms and conditions relating
to
Confidential Information contained herein.  Subject to the last
sentence of Section 24.4 with respect
to Proprietary Operating Information, Owner and Contractor shall be responsible
for any breach of this Agreement by any of their respective Representatives
and
each Party agrees, at its sole






EXECUTION
COPY







101

















expense,
to take all reasonable measures (including but not limited to court proceedings)
to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure
or
use of any Confidential Information and each Party shall indemnify the
other
Party from any acts or omissions of its Representatives with respect to
the
Confidential Information delivered to such indemnifying Party.  For
purposes of this Article 24,
“Representatives” means directors, officers,
employees, contractors,
subcontractors and their subcontractors and affiliates, agents or advisors
(including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers,
financial advisors, lenders, equity investors, potential bankers, potential
lenders and potential equity investors).



24.2           Competitor
Representative.  In the event any Representative of Owner is
reasonably deemed by Contractor to be a direct competitor of Contractor
(a
“Competitor Representative”), Owner, acting prudently and
reasonably, shall only disclose Contractor Confidential Information to
such
Competitor Representative in the event that Owner determines that such
party
would be unable to perform its services for the Project without receipt
of such
information; provided that such Competitor Representative's access with
respect to Contractor pricing information shall only include access to
Contract
Price reconciliations with respect to Provisional Items and the escalation
program set forth in Exhibit I, and Contractor’s Invoices that are
formatted on a percentage of the Contract Price and information relating
to a
proposed Change in Work; provided, further, that such Competitor
Representative shall only have access to a redacted copy of this Agreement
excluding pricing information.  Such Competitor Representative shall
in no event be given access to any financial statements or other financial
information relating to Contractor.  Owner shall cause each Competitor
Representative to enter into a non-disclosure agreement directly with Contractor
prior to disclosing any Contractor Confidential Information to such
party.  In addition, Owner and each such Competitor Representative
shall be responsible for ensuring that only those individual employees
or agents
of such Competitor Representative who are directly engaged in providing
services
to Owner for the Project (such individuals or agents, “Authorized
Competitor Representative Recipients”) will have access to or receive
any Contractor Confidential Information and that all such Authorized Competitor
Representative Recipients acknowledge in writing receipt of a copy of this
Article 24 and agree in writing
to use the Contractor Confidential Information only for the Intended Purposes
and to otherwise comply with the terms hereof to the same extent as if
they were
parties hereto. Owner shall provide Contractor with a list of the Authorized
Competitor Representative Recipients and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such written acknowledgements from such
individuals.  Owner shall take commercially reasonable steps to ensure
that the Competitor Representative takes such action and maintains such
processes as are necessary to ensure the confidentiality of all hard copies
of
the Contractor Confidential Information.  Similarly, with respect to
Contractor Confidential Information received electronically, Owner and
Contractor will jointly work on implementing an electronic access protocol
that
will be designed to track and verify authorized electronic access and usage
in
line with the foregoing principles.



24.3           Excluded
Information.  Confidential Information shall not include any
information that:  (i) is already in the public knowledge or
which becomes public knowledge absent any violation of the terms of this
Agreement; (ii) was already in the possession of a Party prior to disclosure
by
the other Party; provided, however, that any Confidential
Information previously provided by Owner and subsequently defined as Proprietary
Operating Information shall thereafter be treated as Proprietary Operating
Information; (iii) a Party obtains from another






EXECUTION
COPY







102

















Person
which such Party reasonably believes was not under an obligation of
confidentiality; or (iv) is or becomes generally available to, or is
independently known to or has been or is developed by, any Party or any
of its
Affiliates other than materially as a result of any disclosure of confidential
proprietary information by the transferor to the
transferee.



24.4           Acknowledgments
of Proprietary Operating Information.  In addition, with respect
to any Confidential Information identified in writing in advance by Owner
as
Proprietary Operating Information, Contractor shall provide such Proprietary
Operating Information only to such Subcontractors and its and their Affiliates
that enter into a confidentiality agreement directly with Owner, and each
individual who will have access to such Proprietary Operating Information
must
acknowledge in writing receipt of a copy of this Article 24 and agree in writing to
use the Proprietary
Operating Information only for the Intended Purposes and to otherwise comply
with the terms hereof to the same extent as if they were parties hereto
(any
such confidentiality agreement or individual acknowledgment, a
“POI Acknowledgement”).  In the event that Owner
identifies certain information as Proprietary Operating Information, and
in
order to accomplish the Intended Purposes it is necessary for Contractor
to
disclose such Proprietary Operating Information to any Subcontractor or
Affiliate, Contractor may submit a Change in Work Form to Owner detailing
(i) the proposed change, if any, to the Milestone Summary Schedule and the
Project Guaranteed Dates associated with securing the necessary POI
Acknowledgements, and (ii) the proposed cost involved in securing the
necessary POI Acknowledgments as described on the Change in Work
Form.  Contractor agrees to provide Owner a list of every Person that
has been provided Proprietary Operating Information by Contractor or any
of its
Subcontractors or Affiliates and the Acknowledgements with respect to the
Proprietary Operating Information signed by each of those
Persons.  Contractor agrees to be responsible for the actions of each
of its individual employees with respect to treatment of any Proprietary
Operating Information.  Owner agrees to rely on the POI
Acknowledgements executed by a Subcontractor or Subcontractor’s Affiliate with
respect to actions of any such Subcontractor’s or Subcontractor’s Affiliates’
individual employees; provided, further, that Contractor agrees to
provide reasonable assistance to Owner with respect to enforcement of the
POI
Acknowledgments.



24.5           Non-Disclosure.  Neither
the transferee nor any consultant or other person to whom any confidential
or
proprietary information is provided in connection with the Project or
performance of this Agreement shall publish or otherwise disclose such
information to others or use such information for any purpose except as
expressly provided above without the written approval of the transferor;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit: (a) the
right of Owner to provide any information regarding Contractor, any
Subcontractor, this Agreement, or the Work to its legal, technical and
other
officers, its then existing or prospective successors or assigns or any
Financing Entity (or advisors retained on their behalf) or its successors
and
assigns (in each case, excluding any Competitor Representative unless expressly
permitted herein); or (b) the right of Owner to reproduce and use as many
copies of any drawings and specifications or other documents provided to
Owner
as Owner in its sole discretion considers useful or necessary for the
furtherance of the Work, operation and maintenance of the Project, or otherwise
related to the Project, regardless of any notices, legends, or disclaimers
on
such drawings and specifications or other documents.

24.6           Applicable
Law Disclosures.  In the event that a transferor is requested or
required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information
or
documents in legal proceedings, or by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose
any
Confidential Information, the transferor shall provide the transferee with
prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the transferee
may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Agreement.  If, in the absence of a
protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the transferee,
the transferor is nonetheless legally compelled to make any such disclosure
of
Confidential Information or else stand liable for contempt, the transferor
may,
without liability hereunder, disclose to such Person only that portion
of the
Confidential Information that on the advice of counsel is legally required
to be
disclosed, provided that the transferor uses its reasonable efforts to
assist the transferee in obtaining an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential
Information.



24.7           Ownership
of Confidential Information.  All Confidential Information
obtained, developed or created by or for Contractor exclusively for the
Project,
including the drawings and specifications and any copies of Confidential
Information, is the exclusive property of Owner whether delivered to Owner
or
not; provided, however, that Contractor may also use such
Confidential Information for internal purposes.  No right or license
is granted to Contractor or any third-party respecting the use of such
Confidential Information by virtue of this Agreement, except to the extent
required for Contractor’s performance of its obligations
hereunder.  Contractor shall deliver all Owner’s Confidential
Information, including all copies thereof, to Owner upon request; Owner
shall
also deliver all Contractor’s Confidential Information to Contractor upon
request; provided, however, in either case the receiving party may
keep one copy for archival purposes only; provided, further, such
copy shall remain subject to the obligations of this Article 24.



24.8           Remedies.  Contractor
and Owner each recognize and acknowledge the competitive and confidential
nature
of the Confidential Information and each agrees that irreparable damage
will
result to the other Party if Confidential Information of such other Party
is
disclosed to any third party except as herein permitted or is used for
any
purpose other than the purposes of this Agreement.  The Parties agree
that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this
Article 24.  Accordingly,
the Parties agree that a Party whose Confidential Information is disclosed
to a
third party in breach of this Article 24 shall be entitled to an
injunction or
injunctions (without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual
damages) to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Article 24, and to specific performance
of this
Article 24, and that neither the
other Party nor its Affiliates will oppose the granting of such
relief.  Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive
remedies for a breach of this Article 24, but shall be in addition
to all other
remedies available at law or equity.



25.           INVENTIONS
AND LICENSES



25.1           Invention,
License.  Any idea, invention, work of authorship, drawing,
design, formula, algorithm, utility, tool, pattern, compilation, program,
device, method, technique, process, improvement, development or discovery
(collectively, “Invention”), whether or not patentable, or
copyrightable, or entitled to legal protection as a trade secret or otherwise,
that

COPY







104

















Contractor
may conceive, make, develop, create, reduce to practice, or work on, in
whole or
in part, in the course of performing the Work shall be owned and retained
by
Contractor.  Contractor hereby grants to Owner an irrevocable,
nonexclusive royalty-free license (which license is freely assignable (a)
to any
Financing Entity or any assignee of such Financing Entity, (b) to any party
to which the Project is sold or otherwise transferred, and (c) to any successor
in interest to Owner’s rights hereunder), to use all Inventions, other
proprietary rights and specialized knowledge of Contractor which, in each
case,
form a part of the Work for Owner’s use to the extent reasonably necessary for
(x) the operation, maintenance, repair, or alteration of the Project or
any
subsystem or components thereof in connection with the Project or (y) to
the
extent such Inventions are related to any operational best practices, for
the
operation, maintenance, repair, or alteration of any other project developed
by
Owner or any Affiliate of Owner or of any subsystem or component thereof,
with
Owner’s or its Affiliate’s exercise of such license to be at Owner’s and its
Affiliate’s sole risk and expense and subject to the rights of third-parties;
provided, however, that the use of Contractor’s Inventions
pursuant to clause (y), above, shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 24.2 and in no event
shall Contractor Deliverables be provided to any third party for purposes
of any
other Project.  Contractor shall, prior to directing any Subcontractor
to produce any design or engineering work in connection with the Project,
obtain
a valid written license of any such inventions, specialized knowledge or
other
proprietary property from such Subcontractor in terms substantially similar
to
those that obligate Contractor to Owner as expressed in this
Section 25.1; provided,
however, Contractor
shall use commercially best efforts to insure that
Owner shall have the ability to use Subcontractor’s Inventions pursuant to
clause (y), above, which use shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 24.2; provided,
further, that any
license to use any Subcontractor’s Inventions pursuant
to clause (y) above shall not include an express or implied license to
make,
have made, or use component parts, or construct, create or reverse engineer
equipment.  All Contractor Deliverables and computer software prepared
by Contractor pursuant to this Agreement are instruments of service in
respect
to the Project.  They are not intended or represented to be suitable
for reuse by Owner or others on extensions of the Project or on any other
project.  Any reuse without prior written verification or adaptation
by Contractor for the specific purpose intended will be at Owner’s sole risk and
without liability or legal exposure to Contractor.  Owner shall
defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contractor against all Losses arising
out
of or resulting from such reuse.  Contractor shall, at Owner’s expense
and request, execute or cause the execution of any documentation reasonably
requested by Owner in order to effectuate the foregoing.  Except as
specifically stated herein, no other license in such patents and proprietary
information is granted pursuant to this Agreement.



25.2           Contractor
Deliverables.  Subject to Section 25.1, the Contractor Deliverables
accumulated
or developed by Contractor or its employees, to the extent Owner may determine,
shall become the property of Owner without any further consideration to
be
provided therefore, when prepared or in process, whether or not delivered
by
Contractor; provided, however, Contractor shall be permitted to
use such Contractor Deliverables as reference material for its internal
use
only.  Contractor shall deliver the Contractor Deliverables to Owner
upon its request upon any termination of this Agreement (except to the
extent of
any payment default of Owner that is an Owner Event of Default) or completion
of
the Work.



25.3           Software
Licenses.  To the extent Contractor purchases any software which
software is necessary or otherwise desirable for the continued operation
of the
Project after

COPY







105

















Substantial
Completion, Contractor shall provide Owner with latest upgrade of such
software
as of the Substantial Completion Date and shall register Owner as the licensee
of such software with the applicable Vendor.



25.4           Warranty.  Contractor
expressly warrants that there has been, and covenants that there will be,
no
violation, misappropriation or infringement of any trade secret, patent,
trademark, copyright, or other third-party property right (including any
violation of a third-party license) in any way connected with or arising
out of
performing the work specified in this Agreement.



26.           ASSIGNMENT
BY OWNER



26.1           Assignment.



26.1.1                Assignment
to Financing Entities.  Owner may, without Contractor’s prior
consent but upon five (5) days prior Notice to Contractor, make a collateral
assignment of all or part of its right, title, and interest in this Agreement
to
any Financing Entity.  Any such Financing Entity may further
sub-assign all or any portion of Owner’s rights and obligations hereunder to
Owner or any Affiliate of Owner.  Any Financing Entity may, in
connection with any default under any financing document related to the
Project,
assign any rights assigned to it hereunder to any Person without the consent
of
Contractor or Owner.  Contractor agrees that, upon receipt of written
notice of such permitted assignment, it shall deliver all documents, data,
Notices, and other communications required to be delivered to Owner hereunder
to
Owner and to the Financing Entities or to any other permitted assignee
at such
address as such Persons shall designate to Contractor in
writing.



26.1.2                Assignment
to Other Persons.  In addition, Owner may assign all or part of
its right, title, and interest in this Agreement to any other Person, including
an Affiliate of Owner, with the prior written approval of Contractor, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  As a condition to any
such assignment, Contractor in its sole discretion may require that the
prospective assignee provide performance security for Owner’s obligations
hereunder as follows.  Contractor’s approval, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, shall not be withheld if all of the conditions
in any of
subsections (a) through (d)
below are
satisfied.



(a)           Owner
may assign this Agreement to a project entity created to develop the Project
if
that entity (i) has a Tangible Net Worth of at least One Hundred Fifty
Million
Dollars ($150,000,000) (the “Minimum Tangible Net Worth”) and a
credit rating equal to or greater than the Threshold Rating, and (ii) (A)
a
Tangible Net Worth of at least the Minimum Tangible Net Worth plus at least
Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), or (B) a Tangible Net Worth of at
least the
Minimum Tangible Net Worth plus causes to be provided insurance coverage
with
minimum coverage of at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and in
a
mutually agreeable form, with deductibles payable by Owner, against potential
environmental remediation costs or other environmental claims; provided,
however, should the insurance not be commercially available or
Owner and
Contractor are unable to agree to the form and substance of the policy,
then TXU
US Holdings Company or, to the extent any successor Owner has a Tangible
Net
Worth of at least the Minimum Tangible Net Worth plus at least Fifty Million
Dollars ($50,000,000), such successor Owner, shall retain liability for
all
potential






EXECUTION
COPY







106

















environmental
remediation costs or other environmental claims for which Owner would otherwise
be liable hereunder.  If (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence are
satisfied, Contractor may not require any performance security for Owner’s
obligations from such prospective assignee upon such Person’s assumption of this
Agreement; provided, however, if such assignee’s Tangible Net
Worth declines by more than thirty percent (30%) of the Minimum Tangible
Net
Worth or its credit rating falls below the Threshold Rating, such assignee
shall
provide, or cause to be provided, either: (y) a letter of credit, bond
or other
form of security, securing assignee’s obligations hereunder in an amount equal
to the Required LOC Amount as provided in subsection (c) below; or (z) a guaranty
from an entity
having a Tangible Net Worth of at least the Minimum Tangible Net Worth
and an
equivalent or higher credit rating than the Threshold Rating, guaranteeing
assignee’s obligations hereunder in an amount equal to the Guaranteed Amount as
provided in subsection (d)
below.



(b)           If
any proposed assignee (i) has written commitments from lenders or equity
investors (where the lead lender or investor has a Tangible Net Worth of
at
least the Minimum Tangible Net Worth and an equivalent or higher credit
rating
than the Threshold Rating) to provide financing for the Project in an amount
equal to no less than the portion of the Contract Price then remaining
to be
paid, and (ii) (A) a Tangible Net Worth of at least the Minimum Tangible
Net
Worth plus at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), or (B) a Tangible
Net
Worth of at least the Minimum Tangible Net Worth plus causes to be provided
insurance coverage with minimum coverage of at least Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000) and in a mutually agreeable form, against potential environmental
remediation costs or other environmental claims, with deductibles payable
by
Owner; provided, however, should the insurance not be commercially
available or Owner and Contractor are unable to agree to the form and substance
of the policy, then TXU US Holdings Company or, to the extent any successor
Owner has a Tangible Net Worth of at least the Minimum Tangible Net Worth
plus
at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), such successor Owner, shall
retain
liability for all potential environmental remediation costs or other
environmental claims for which Owner would otherwise be liable
hereunder.  If (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence are satisfied,
Contractor may not require any performance security for Owner’s obligations from
such prospective assignee upon such Person’s assumption of this
Agreement.



(c)           If
any proposed assignee causes to be provided (i) a letter of credit in support
of
such assignee’s obligations hereunder from a bank that has senior unsecured debt
rated at least A- by Standard & Poors or A3 by Moody’s (or an equivalent
rating from a similar rating agency), and such letter of credit: (x) names
Contractor as the stated beneficiary, (w) has a stated amount at least
equal to the sum of (the “Required LOC Amount”): (1) the
next two (2) consecutive Monthly Payments to be made pursuant to the Payment
Schedule; (2) breakage costs or termination fees that would be incurred by
Contractor upon termination of Equipment and Materials purchase agreements
or
purchase orders; (3) amounts past due hereunder by Owner to Contractor as
of such date; and (4) the positive or negative difference in the Contract
Price based on Changes In Work during the last calendar quarter; and
(x) provides that it will be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes to (1),
(2), (3) and (4) during each calendar quarter within thirty (30) days following
the end of such calendar quarter; and (ii) insurance coverage with minimum
coverage of at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and in a mutually
agreeable form, with deductibles payable by Owner, against potential
environmental remediation costs or other environmental claims; provided,
however, should the insurance not be commercially available
or

107

















Owner
and Contractor are unable to agree to the form and substance of the policy,
then
TXU US Holdings Company or, to the extent any successor Owner has a Tangible
Net
Worth of at least the Minimum Tangible Net Worth plus at least Fifty Million
Dollars ($50,000,000), such successor Owner, shall retain liability for
all
potential environmental remediation costs or other environmental claims
for
which Owner would otherwise be liable hereunder.  If (i) and (ii) of
the preceding sentence are satisfied, Contractor may not require further
performance security from any prospective assignee.  The terms
pertaining to draw rights on such letter of credit shall be substantially
similar to those of the Retainage Security.  In
the event Contractor draws under such
letter of credit and it is subsequently determined that such drawdown was
in
excess of Contractor's rights hereunder, Contractor shall return such excess
amount to such assignee within ten (10) Business Days of such final
determination with interest at the Contract Interest Rate from such drawdown
until return of such excess amount.



(d)           Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, TXU US Holdings Company or,
to the
extent any successor Owner has a Tangible Net Worth of at least the Minimum
Tangible Net Worth plus at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000), such
successor Owner, may (i) assign its rights hereunder to any Person upon
five (5) days prior Notice to Contractor but without Contractor’s consent;
provided, however, that Owner retains its payment obligations
hereunder, including its obligations pursuant to Section 23.2, or (ii) assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to any Person upon five (5) days prior Notice to
Contractor but without Contractor’s consent; provided, however,
that such Owner provides a guarantee of such assignee’s obligations hereunder,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Contractor, and in an amount
equal to the sum of (the “Guaranteed Amount”) (A) the next
two (2) consecutive Monthly Payments to be made pursuant to the Payment
Schedule, (B) breakage costs or termination fees that would be incurred by
Contractor upon termination of Equipment and Materials purchase agreements
or
purchase orders, (C) amounts past due hereunder by Owner to Contractor as
of such date, (D) the positive or negative difference in the Contract Price
based on Changes In Work during the last calendar quarter, plus (E) (y)
Fifty
Million Dollars ($50,000,000), or (z) causes to be provided insurance coverage
with minimum coverage of at least Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) and
in a
mutually agreeable form, with deductibles payable by Owner, against potential
environmental remediation costs or other environmental claims; provided,
however, should the insurance not be commercially available or
Owner and
Contractor are unable to agree to the form and substance of the policy,
then
Owner shall retain liability for all potential environmental remediation
costs
or other environmental claims for which Owner would otherwise be liable
hereunder.  Contractor may terminate this Agreement in the event that
the guaranty provided by Owner pursuant to this Section 26.1.2(d) lapses or terminates and
assignee
fails to provide, within twenty (20) days of Notice of same from Contractor,
a
substitute guaranty of assignee’s obligations hereunder in an amount equal to
Guaranteed Amount from an entity having a Tangible Net Worth of no less
than the
Minimum Tangible Net Worth and an equivalent or higher credit rating than
the
Threshold Rating.



(e)           Upon
the assignment of Owner’s rights and obligations hereunder to any permitted
assignee pursuant to subsections (a), (b)
or
(c) or subsection (d)(ii)
above, and such permitted assignee’s assumption in writing in of such rights and
obligations, Owner shall be deemed released from and shall have no further
rights, obligations, responsibilities or liabilities under this Agreement;
provided that Owner shall remain responsible for all liabilities relating
to matters occurring prior to such assignment, except to the extent such
permitted assignee agrees






EXECUTION
COPY







108

















in
writing to be responsible for such liabilities; provided, further,
that Owner shall remain responsible for the Guaranteed Amount if Owner
has
provided a guarantee pursuant to subsection (d)(ii)
above.



(f)           Any
attempted assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 26.1.2 shall be null and void and
shall be
ineffective to relieve Owner of its obligations hereunder.



26.1.3                Owner
Indemnitee to Include Successors and Assigns.  Upon any assignment
by Owner hereunder, the definition of “Owner Indemnitee” shall
be deemed modified to include the assignor and assignee under such assignment
and each of their respective employees, agents, partners, Affiliates,
shareholders, directors, officers and assigns.



26.2           Transfer
of Work; Third-Party Beneficiaries.  Upon five (5) days prior
Notice to Contractor, Owner may assign, convey or transfer all or part
of its
right, title, and interest in the Work to any Affiliate of Owner (whether
or not
such Affiliate provides consideration to Owner for such assignment, conveyance
or transfer).  Subject to Section 31.2, each such Affiliate-assignee
shall be
deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of the following provisions of this
Agreement:  Article 17, but only to the extent
any portion of the
Work is assigned, conveyed or transferred to such Affiliate assignee,
Section 23.1, but only to the
extent any portion of the Work is assigned, conveyed or transferred to
such
Affiliate-assignee; and Article 29.  Owner shall have the right
to
enforce any provisions of this Agreement with respect to any Work assigned,
conveyed or transferred to an Affiliate (including any warranties, indemnities
or rights to receive liquidated damages with respect to such Work) and
such
assignment, conveyance or transfer shall not affect Owner’s rights hereunder
with respect to any Work.



27.           ASSIGNMENT
BY CONTRACTOR



Contractor
understands that this Agreement is personal to Contractor.  Contractor
shall have no right, power, or authority to assign or delegate this Agreement
or
any portion thereof, either voluntarily or involuntarily, or by operation
of
law.  Absent Owner’s prior written approval, Contractor’s attempted
assignment or delegation of any of its Work hereunder shall be null and
void and
shall be ineffective to relieve Contractor of its responsibility for the
Work
assigned or delegated.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the
right of Contractor to subcontract out portions of this Work to others
in
accordance with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement.



28.           HAZARDOUS
MATERIALS



28.1           Use
or Disposal by Contractor.  Contractor shall not and shall not
permit any of its Subcontractors, directly or indirectly, to permit the
manufacture, storage, transmission or presence of any Hazardous Materials
on the
Project Site, and Contractor shall not and shall not permit any of its
Subcontractors to release, discharge or otherwise dispose of any Hazardous
Materials on the Project Site except, in each case, in compliance with
Applicable Laws.



28.2           Remediation
by Contractor.  Without limiting what may constitute a “Change In
Law” hereunder, in the event of a release, discharge or presence of Hazardous
Materials brought onto or generated at the Project Site by Contractor or
any
Subcontractor or any third-party acting






EXECUTION

on
behalf of Contractor (other than Owner or any of its other contractors
or
subcontractors) that is not in compliance with Applicable Laws, Contractor
shall
conduct and complete all investigations, studies, sampling, testing and
remediation of the Project Site to the extent required by Applicable
Laws.  Contractor shall promptly comply with all lawful orders and
directives of all Governmental Authorities regarding compliance with Applicable
Laws relating to such Hazardous Materials except to the extent any such
orders
or directives are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
in
connection with the Work.



28.3           Notice
of Hazardous Materials.  If Contractor discovers or is notified of
the existence of any spill or release of any Hazardous Materials at the
Project
Site:



(a)           Contractor
shall promptly notify Owner thereof and restrict access to the area containing
such Hazardous Materials;



(b)           if
Contractor or any Subcontractor has brought such Hazardous Materials onto
the
Project Site or has generated such Hazardous Materials as part of the Work,
Contractor shall promptly remove such Hazardous Materials from the Project
Site
and remediate the Project Site in accordance with all Applicable Laws and
Applicable Permits and at Contractor’s sole cost and expense;



(c)           Contractor
shall not be entitled to any extension of time or additional compensation
hereunder for any delay or costs incurred by Contractor as a result of
the
existence of such Hazardous Materials if Contractor or any Subcontractor
is
responsible for the spill or release of such Hazardous Materials;
and



(d)           if
neither Contractor nor any Subcontractor has brought such Hazardous Materials
on
to the Project Site or generated such Hazardous Materials as part of the
Work,
Contractor shall suspend the Work if required by Owner or to the extent
required
by Applicable Law or reasonably necessary to protect the health and safety
of
persons and property.  Contractor shall use reasonable efforts
consistent with the requirements of Applicable Law or the health and safety
of
persons or property to mitigate the effects of such suspension and the
amount of
Work so suspended.  If such a suspension occurs, Contractor shall not
be obligated to re-commence such suspended Work until Contractor in good
faith
believes that Owner has remedied or caused others to remedy the circumstances
requiring such suspension.



28.4           Hazardous
Materials not brought on the Project Site by Contractor.  Any
changes to the Work required to mitigate or remediate any contaminated
materials
or Hazardous Materials at the Project Site not brought on to the Project
Site or
generated as part of the Work by either Contractor or any Subcontractor,
shall
be deemed an Excusable Event and be subject to the provisions of
Section 8.6.2.



28.5           Losses
related to Hazardous Materials.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, CONTRACTOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS PRESENT ON THE PROJECT
SITE
BEFORE CONTRACTOR COMMENCES THE WORK ON THE PROJECT SITE, BUT DISTURBED
OR
OTHERWISE HANDLED BY CONTRACTOR OR ANY SUBCONTRACTOR DURING PERFORMANCE
OF THE
WORK,

29.           NON-PAYMENT
CLAIMS



Subject
to timely payment by Owner in accordance with Article 6, Contractor shall not directly
or indirectly
create, incur, assume or suffer to be created by it or any Subcontractor,
employee, laborer, materialman or other supplier of goods or services to
Contractor any right of retention, mortgage, pledge, assessment, security
interest, lease, advance claim, levy, claim, lien, charge or encumbrance
on the
Work, the Project Site, the Common Facilities, the Shared Site Facilities,
the
Project or any part thereof or interest therein (each a “Contractor
Lien”).  Subject to timely payment by Owner in accordance
with Article 6, Contractor shall
keep the Project Site, the Common Facilities, the Shared Site Facilities,
the
Work, the Equipment and Materials, and all Subcontractor equipment and
materials
free of Contractor Liens.  Contractor shall promptly pay or discharge,
and discharge of record, any such Contractor Lien or other charges which,
if
unpaid, might be or become a Contractor Lien.  Contractor shall
immediately notify Owner of the assertion of any Contractor Lien.  If
any Owner Indemnitee becomes aware of any Contractor Lien, such Owner Indemnitee
may so notify contractor in writing, and Contractor shall then: (a) satisfy
and obtain the release of such Contractor Lien; or (b) defend Owner
Indemnitees against any such Contractor Lien, provide assurances of payment
as
described in the last sentence of this Article 29 and obtain the release of
such Contractor
Lien.  If Contractor does not promptly, and in any event within
ten (10) days after such Notice, satisfy such Contractor Lien, give such
Owner Indemnitee reasons in writing that are satisfactory to such Owner
Indemnitee for not causing the release of such Contractor Lien, or contest
such
Contractor Lien in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence
of this
Article 29, then any Owner
Indemnitee shall have the right, at its option, after written notification
to
Contractor, and subject to Applicable Law, to cause the release of, pay,
or
settle such Contractor Lien, and Owner at its sole option
may:  (x) draw on the Retainage Security in an amount equal to
all costs and expenses incurred by Owner Indemnitee in causing the release
of,
paying, or settling such Contractor Lien, including administrative costs,
attorneys’ fees, and other expenses, or (y) withhold from any payment otherwise
due to Contractor hereunder an amount equal to all costs and expenses incurred
by Owner Indemnitee in causing the release of, paying, or settling such
Contractor Lien, including administrative costs, attorneys’ fees, and other
expenses.  Contractor shall have the right to contest any such
Contractor Lien, provided it first posts a bond or other assurances of
payment as may be required to remove such lien from the Work or the Project
Site, as applicable.

31.           LIMITATIONS
OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES



31.1           Limitations
on Damages.  Except to the extent damages claimed by third-parties
for which Contractor or Owner has a duty to indemnify hereunder as expressly
provided in Article 21 or
express liquidated damages hereunder are shown to be consequential in nature,
notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party
(nor
that Party’s subcontractors) shall be liable to any other Party hereto for any
loss of profits, loss of revenue, or loss of use of the Project, losses
or costs
based on third party contracts, losses, costs or expenses of obtaining,
maintaining or repaying finance or capital, or downtime costs, loss of
opportunity or goodwill, cost of purchased or replacement power, claims
of
customers for such damages, any governmental fines or penalties or sanctions
imposed (except as otherwise expressly provided in Article 23) or any loss, damage or
other liability
otherwise equivalent to any indirect consequential, exemplary, or special
damages arising from performing or a failure to perform any obligation
under
this Agreement, whether such liability arises in contract, tort (including
negligence or strict liability), or otherwise.



31.2           Limitations
on Contractor’s Liability.



31.2.1               Maximum
Liability Amount.



(a)           Prior
to achievement of Minimum Stable Load, Contractor’s and its Subcontractors’
liability for claims by Owner arising out of or relating to the performance
or
non-performance of obligations or the Work shall in no event be greater
in the
aggregate than an amount equal to *** percent (***%) of the Contract Price
(“Maximum Total Liability”).



(b)           Upon
the achievement of Minimum Stable Load, the Maximum Total Liability shall
be
reduced to *** Dollars ($***).



(c)           Upon
the achievement of Substantial Completion, the Maximum Total Liability
shall be
reduced to *** Dollars ($***); provided, that an additional ***Dollars
($***) shall be available to remedy any Defects that prevent the Project
from
achieving the stack test Emission Guarantees until such time as Contractor
has
achieved such Emissions Guarantees relating to the stack test; provided,
further, that Contractor shall, in addition to the Maximum Total
Liability following Substantial Completion, remain liable for the undisputed
amount of any Delay Liquidated Damages hereunder previously incurred and
subject
to the applicable cap in Section 31.2.2 below.








***
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE
COMMISSION.

31.2.2               Maximum
Liquidated Damages.  In no event shall Contractor’s aggregate
liability (a) under Section 15.1 for Delay Liquidated Damages
exceed ***
percent (***%) of the Contract Price; (b) under Section 15.3 for Performance Liquidated
Damages exceed
*** percent (***%) of the Contract Price; (c) under Section 15.2 for Reliability Liquidated
Damages exceed
*** percent (***%) of the Contract Price; and (d) in the aggregate under
Sections 15.1, 15.2
and 15.3, exceed *** percent (***%) of the
Contract
Price.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the limitations of this
Section 31.2.2 shall not limit
Owner’s remedies for any other breach of this Agreement other than a failure
of
the Project to achieve Substantial Completion on or before the Substantial
Completion Guaranteed Date, the failure of the Project to satisfy the
Performance Guarantees or the failure of the Project to satisfy the Reliability
Guarantee.



31.2.3               Calculation
of Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 31.2 shall be construed to limit
Contractor’s
liability (a) with respect to any of its indemnity obligations under
Article 21, or (b) with
respect to any fraud of Contractor.  Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, for purposes of determining whether the maximum liability
amounts provided in Section 31.2
have been exceeded, the following items shall be excluded from the calculation
of any such maximum liability amount: (a) liabilities of Contractor to
Owner covered by insurance proceeds to the extent paid pursuant to
Article 21 of this Agreement
(except deductibles paid by Contractor); and (b) amounts paid by Contractor
to or on behalf of Owner in respect of any damages or third-party claims
arising
out of the fraud of Contractor.



31.3           Specific
Performance.  In addition to any other rights and remedies of
Owner hereunder or at law, as a specific performance obligation, Contractor
guarantees that the Project shall as a condition to Substantial Completion,
achieve the Emissions Guarantees.  Contractor acknowledges that
Contractor’s failure to achieve the Emissions Guarantees identified in Part I,
Section 8.1.5 of the Scope Book would cause Owner irreparable harm for
which money damages would not constitute an adequate remedy, and therefore
Contractor stipulates that specific performance is an appropriate remedy
should
Contractor breach such obligation.



31.4           Limitation
on Owner’s Liability.  In no event shall Owner’s liability
pursuant to this Agreement, whether arising in contract warranty, or otherwise,
be greater in the aggregate than the Contract Price and any other amounts
for
which Owner is expressly obligated to pay Contractor pursuant hereto, less
amounts previously paid by Owner; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 31.4
or in any other provision of this Agreement shall be construed to limit
Owner’s
liability for:  (a) its indemnity obligations pursuant to
Article 21; or (b) with
respect to any fraud on the part of Owner.  Contractor’s sole recourse
for any damages or liabilities due to Contractor by Owner pursuant to this
Agreement shall be limited to the assets of Owner without recourse individually
or collectively to the assets of the members or the Affiliates of Owner,
the
Financing Entities or their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents
of Owner, its members or their Affiliates.

31.5           Releases,
Indemnities and Limitations.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
HEREIN, RELEASES, INDEMNITIES, ASSUMPTIONS OF AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITIES
AND
LIMITATIONS ON REMEDIES EXPRESSED IN THIS AGREEMENT AS WELL AS WAIVERS
OF
SUBROGATION RIGHTS SHALL APPLY EVEN IN THE EVENT OF FAULT, NEGLIGENCE,
OR STRICT
LIABILITY OF THE PARTY RELEASED OR INDEMNIFIED OR WHOSE LIABILITY IS LIMITED
OR
ASSUMED OR AGAINST WHOM RIGHT OF SUBROGATION ARE WAIVED AND SHALL EXTEND
TO SUCH
PARTY’S SUBCONTRACTORS, AND IN EACH CASE TO SUCH PARTY’S AND ITS SUBCONTRACTORS’
AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS,
OR
ENTITIES OF SUCH PARTNERS SUCH AS PARTNERS AND RELATED ENTITIES.  THE
PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT SATISFIES THE EXPRESS
NEGLIGENCE RULE.



31.6           Representations
and Remedies.  Each Party makes no representations, covenants,
warranties, or guarantees, express or implied, other than those expressly
set
forth herein and in the Exhibits hereto.



31.7           Limitation
on Remedies.  It is the intent of Owner and Contractor that if any
provision of this Agreement states that the rights and remedies stated
therein
are the sole or exclusive (or words of similar import) rights or remedies
for
the failure to satisfy the applicable obligation arising thereunder, that
such
rights and remedies shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties
for
failure to satisfy such obligations, notwithstanding any remedy otherwise
available at law or in equity.  To the extent the terms of this
Agreement do not provide a remedy for the failure to satisfy an applicable
obligation or do not otherwise state that an applicable remedy is a sole
or
exclusive (or words of similar import) remedy, then the Parties may avail
themselves of any right or remedy available at law or in equity for such
failure, provided that such right or remedy as may be available at law or
in equity shall in any event be limited by the limitations, waivers and
releases
of liability set forth in this Agreement.  For purposes of clarity,
except as specifically provided in Article 19, the foregoing shall not
be construed to
limit a Party’s right to exercise its dispute resolution rights under
Article 32 at any time during
the term of this Agreement.



32.           DISPUTES



32.1           Management
Negotiations.  Any disputes arising under this Agreement that are
not resolved between Owner and Contractor within ten (10) Business Days
after
receipt by each thereof of Notice (specifically referencing this
Section 32.1) of such dispute,
shall be referred by either Owner or Contractor’s representatives to the
executive officers of Owner and Contractor (who shall not be Owner’s Project
Representative or the Project Manager) for resolution.  If such
executive officers, negotiating in good faith, fail to reach an agreement
within
a reasonable period of time, not exceeding twenty (20) days after such
referral,
then either Owner or Contractor may bring a suit, claim or cause of action
pursuant to the terms of Section 32.2 below.



32.2           DISPUTE
RESOLUTION; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE.  TO THE EXTENT
FEDERAL COURTS HAVE JURISDICTION, OWNER AND CONTRACTOR AGREE THAT ALL ACTIONS
OR
PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE TRIED AND
LITIGATED ONLY IN THE FEDERAL

(OR ANY SIMILAR LEGAL DOCTRINE) OR TO OBJECT TO VENUE TO THE EXTENT ANY

STIPULATE
THAT THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF DALLAS, STATE
OF TEXAS
SHALL HAVE INPERSONAM JURISDICTION AND VENUE OVER SUCH PARTY FOR
THE PURPOSE OF LITIGATING ANY SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR PROCEEDING
ARISING
OUT OF RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.  OWNER AND CONTRACTOR EACH AGREE, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY FEDERAL LAW, NOT TO RAISE ANY OBJECTION
TO THE
REMOVAL OR TRANSFER TO THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT LOCATED IN THE COUNTY
OF
DALLAS, STATE OF TEXAS OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING THAT IS INITIALLY BROUGHT
IN ANY
OTHER COURT.  OWNER AND CONTRACTOR ALSO EACH HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.  OWNER AND CONTRACTOR
EACH AGREE THAT IT WILL NOT FILE ANY MOTION OR ASSERT ANY DEFENSE IN ANY
SUCH
PROCEEDING THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE FOREGOING AGREEMENTS, WAIVERS,
CONSENTS
OR STIPULATIONS.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY
BELIEVES THAT THE REQUIREMENT OF DIVERSITY OF CITIZENSHIP OF THE PARTIES
(ONE OF
THE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED FOR A FEDERAL COURT TO HAVE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
OVER A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES) IS MET.



32.3           Work
to Continue.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Contractor shall
diligently carry on the Work during the pendency of any disputes  so
long as all undisputed amounts payable to Contractor hereunder have been
paid.



33.           MISCELLANEOUS



33.1           Severability.  The
invalidity or unenforceability of any portion or provision of this Agreement
shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other portion
or
provision hereof.  Any invalid or unenforceable portion or provision
shall be deemed severed from this Agreement and the balance of this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced as if this Agreement did not contain such
invalid or unenforceable portion or provision.  If any such provision
of this Agreement is so declared invalid, the Parties shall promptly negotiate
in good faith new provisions to eliminate such invalidity and to restore
this
Agreement as near as possible to its original intent and effect.



33.2           Governing
Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the
State of Texas, excluding its conflict of laws
provisions.

33.3           Survival
of Termination.  The provisions of this Agreement which by their
nature are intended to survive the termination, cancellation, completion
or
expiration of this Agreement including any express limitations of or releases
from liability shall continue as a valid and enforceable obligation of
the Party
notwithstanding any such termination, cancellation, completion or
expiration.



33.4           Amendments
and Modifications.  No oral or written amendment or modification
of this Agreement (including a Change In Work Form accepted under
Article 16) by any officer,
agent, or employee of Contractor or Owner, either before or after execution
of
this Agreement, shall be of any force or effect unless such amendment or
modification is in writing and is signed by a duly authorized representative
of
the Party to be bound thereby.



33.5           No
Waiver.  A Party’s waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any
of the terms, covenants, conditions, or other provisions of this Agreement
at
any time shall not in any way affect, limit, modify, or waive that Party’s right
thereafter to enforce or compel strict compliance with every term, covenant,
condition, or other provision hereof, any course of dealing or custom of
the
trade notwithstanding.  All waivers must be in writing and signed on
behalf of Owner and Contractor in accordance with Section 33.4.



33.6           Review
and Approval.  Notwithstanding Owner’s or the Financing Entities’,
if any, review or Owner’s approval of any items submitted to Owner or the
Financing Entities for review or approval, neither Owner nor the Financing
Entities, if any, or any of their representatives or agents reviewing such
items, including the Owner’s Engineer, shall have any liability for, under or in
connection with the items such Person reviews or approves and Contractor
shall
remain responsible for the quality and performance of the
Work.  Neither Owner’s nor the Financing Entities’ review or approval
of any items, including the drawings and specifications, shall constitute
a
waiver of any claim or right that Owner may then or thereafter have against
Contractor.  Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, Owner shall
not unreasonably delay its review of any item submitted by Contractor for
review
or approval.  Any inspection comment, review or approval of any
Contractor Deliverable shall be performed in Owner’s sole
discretion.  The review or approval by Owner of any Subcontractor
shall not constitute any approval of the Work undertaken by any such Person,
cause Owner to have any responsibility for the actions, the Work, or payment
of
such Person or to be deemed to be in an employer-employee relationship
with any
such Subcontractor, or in any way relieve Contractor of its responsibilities
and
obligations under this Agreement.



33.7           Time
is of the Essence.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the express provisions providing for adjustment of
the
Project Guaranteed Dates and the provisions limiting Contractor’s liability for
its failure to timely achieve Substantial Completion by the Substantial
Completion Guaranteed Date as set forth in Section 15.1, Contractor acknowledges
that timely
achievement of Substantial Completion by the Substantial Completion Guaranteed
Date is essential to Owner, and therefore TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE with respect
to
achieving Substantial Completion by the Substantial Completion Guaranteed
Date.



33.8           Third
Party Beneficiaries.  The provisions of this Agreement are
intended for the sole benefit of Owner and Contractor and there are no
third-party beneficiaries hereof, except the

Financing
Entities where expressly provided and assignees as contemplated by the
terms of
Section 26.1.



33.9           Financing
Matters.



33.9.1                Contractor
Cooperation.  Contractor understands that Owner may obtain
financing for the Project consisting of:  (a) one or more
construction or permanent loans, to be secured by all or a portion of the
Project and Owner’s rights under this Agreement; (b) lease financing
pursuant to which Owner may assign this Agreement to one or more Financing
Entities that may then collaterally assign this Agreement to other Financing
Entities or sub-assign all or any portion of Owner’s rights and obligations
hereunder to Owner or an Affiliate of Owner; or (c) a combination
thereof.  In connection therewith, Contractor
shall:  (x) execute any assignments, any amendments and
modifications hereto reasonably requested by the Financing Entities;
(y) promptly execute or consent to other documents to the extent reasonably
required by the Financing Entities, which consents may, among other things,
include provisions whereby Contractor agrees to:  (i) provide
such Financing Entities reasonable notice of and opportunity to cure Owner’s
defaults hereunder; (ii) allow such Financing Entities (as security for
Owner’s financing) to be assigned all of Owner’s rights hereunder and in such
assets in the event of an Owner’s Event of Default; provided,
however, that Owner shall keep Contractor currently informed of
such
assignment or reassignment; (iii) provide for other customary investor or
lender protection provisions that are not in violation of Applicable Law;
and
(iv) provide copies of any Certificate of Substantial Completion, Notice of
Non-Critical Deficiencies, request and use commercially reasonable efforts
to

by
such Major Subcontractor to date and disputed payments, and provide any
other
certificates, Notices and any documents and plans submitted to Owner for
review
or approval hereunder, to the Financing Entities and their designated agents
or
representatives; and (z) deliver customary legal opinions of counsel to
Contractor in accordance with Section 33.16.  Without limiting the
foregoing, Contractor shall enter into such arrangements as Owner or the
Financing Entities may reasonably request to ensure the continued availability
of the Contractor’s Equipment and Materials at the Project Site and the right to
use such Equipment and Materials (whether by Contractor, Owner, or Owner’s
nominees) in the prosecution of the Work as contemplated by this Agreement
until
the Work is completed, including the granting of security interests in
such
Equipment and Materials and shall keep such Equipment and Materials free
and
clear of any liens or encumbrances that could materially affect Contractor’s,
Owner’s, or Owner’s nominee’s rights with respect to such Equipment and
Materials.  Contractor shall respond promptly to requests for
information regarding the qualifications, experience, past performance
and
financial condition of Contractor and other matters pertaining to Contractor’s
obligations hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no
circumstances shall Contractor be obligated to enter into any amendment
and
modification of this Agreement, or any other agreement with Owner or the
Financing Entities, that materially (i) reduces Contractor’s rights as set
forth in this Agreement; (ii) increases Contractor’s cost or risk to
perform the Work, or (iii) reallocates to Contractor any risks or
obligations that are allocated to Owner under this Agreement.



33.9.2                Documents
Requested by Financing Entities.  Contractor shall provide such
data, reports, certifications and other documents, up to a maximum of
ten (10) copies each, or assistance related to the Work or this Agreement
as may be reasonably requested by the






EXECUTION
COPY







118

















Financing
Entities with respect to the financing of the Project; provided,
however, that the provision of this information shall not in any
manner
modify Contractor’s rights or obligations under any other provision of this
Agreement.



33.10                      Other
Assistance.  Contractor shall to the extent reasonably requested
by Owner, assist Owner in dealing with Governmental Authorities and Financing
Entities in any and all matters relating to the Work (including any
interconnection facilities).



33.11                      Further
Assurances.  Owner and Contractor will each use its
reasonable  efforts to implement the provisions of this Agreement, and
for such purpose each, at the reasonable request of the other, will, without
further consideration, promptly execute and deliver or cause to be executed
and
delivered to the other such assistance, or assignments, consents or other
instruments in addition to those required by this Agreement, in form and
substance satisfactory to the other, as the other may reasonably deem necessary
or desirable to implement any provision of this Agreement.



33.12                      Record
Retention.  Contractor agrees to retain for a period of
five (5) years from the Final Completion Date all records relating to its
performance of the Work or Contractor’s warranty obligations herein or for such
longer period of time as may be required pursuant to any applicable order
or
decree of any Governmental Authority, and to cause all Subcontractors engaged
in
connection with the Work or the performance by Contractor of its warranty
obligations herein to retain for the same period all their records relating
to
the Work; provided Contractor’s only obligation with respect to any order
or decree of any Governmental Authority shall be to deliver documents (to
the
extent required by such order or decree) within its possession to Owner,
and
Owner agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all such documents pursuant
to
Article 24.



33.13                      Binding
on Successors, Etc.  Subject to Articles 24 and 26,
this Agreement shall be binding on the Parties hereto and on their respective
successors, heirs and assigns.



33.14                      Merger
of Prior Contracts.  This Agreement supersedes any other
agreement, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered
into
between Owner and Contractor or by any office or officer of such Party
relating
to the Project or the Work including the Memorandum of Understanding dated
January 25, 2006 (as subsequently amended, the “MOU”), between
Owner and Contractor with respect to the Project and the related
TSA.  The MOU and TSA shall terminate upon the mutual execution of
this Agreement, except for any provision of such agreements that expressly
survive the termination thereof, respectively.  Any Work completed by
Contractor under such prior agreements shall be deemed part of the Work
for all
purposes hereunder.  This Agreement and Exhibits hereto constitute the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the Project, and there
are
no other agreements or commitments with respect to the Project except as
set
forth herein.



33.15                      Counterparts.  This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and any Party
hereto
may execute any such counterpart, each of which when executed and delivered
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts taken together
shall constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall
become
effective when each Party hereto shall have received a counterpart by facsimile
or electronic mail hereof signed by

119

















the
other Parties hereto. The Parties agree that the delivery of this Agreement
may
be effected by means of an exchange of facsimile signatures with original
copies
to follow by mail or courier service.



33.16                      Opinions

Utilities Plan to Increase Transmission Investment

(real $2003 in billions, except Newton-Evans estimates)

Historical and Projected Transmission Spending

The Handy-Whitman Index of Public Utility Construction Costs used to adjust for inflation from year to year.  Data represents shareholder-owned electric utilities.
Planned total industry expenditures estimated from 95% response rate to EEI's Electric Transmission Capital Budget & Forecast Survey as of May 2005
(before the Energy Policy Act of 2005).  Actual expenditures from EEI's Annual Property & Plant Capital Investment Survey and FERC Form 1s.

The 2004 and 2005 spending estimates are in nominal $ and from Newton-Evans Market Trends Digest (1st Quarter 2006 edition).

Utilities are planning a 60% increase in expenditures

NERC Projecting Significant Regional Investments

6,036 Miles of new Transmission Lines planned for installation in the U.S. through
2009

26% is Southeastern U.S.

38% is Western U.S.

2005-2009 total new line mile additions ~20% higher versus prior assessment

Source: NERC

Source: NERC 2005 Long-Term Reliability Assessment (Sept 2005)

NERC data covers ~ 55% of the new transmission market  (does not include: transmission
below 230kV, reconductoring, or maintenance)



















Energy Policy Act of 2005 Supports Increased Spending

Repeal of Public Utility Holding Company Act
(PUHCA)

Mandatory reliability rules with federal
oversight

Economic incentives for infrastructure
investment

Facilitates private investment to supplement
public funds

Federal permitting and siting authority for
transmission lines

Increased
investments

in electric
power
infrastructure

Tax, cost recovery benefits for LNG,
renewables, refineries, generation

Implementation progress continues as planned



















Recent Electric Transmission Developments

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued final rules regarding:

Long-term transmission rights

Incentive rates for transmission

Certification of an electric reliability organization (NERC)

Focus on tighter standards and ensuring compliance



FERC approved incentive rate plans for two proposed major transmission lines

Allegheny Energy 300-mile, 500 kV line from Southwestern Pennsylvania to Maryland

AEP 500-mil, 765 kV line from West Virginia to New Jersey




DOE published National Electric Transmission
Congestion Study (August 8, 2006)

Critical congestion areas: Southern California
and Coastal Mid-Atlantic Region

Seeking comments on the national corridors of
interest



Frequent announcements of transmission expansion
plans by utilities and regional planning organizations

PJM upgrades of $1.7B

California ISO approval of 3 projects

WAPA/Tri-State planning 600 miles

Minnesota utilities planning 600 miles



Renewable portfolio standards and Energy Act of
2005 provisions are fostering wind power growth and
related transmission investment




















Summer 2006 Peak Electric Power Developments

Reliability and peak power events highlight
infrastructure inadequacy:

All 7 NERC control areas reported record
demand during the week ending 7/22/06

Peak demands ranged from 0.9% to 4.5%
higher than 2005 peak levels

Regional Distribution Outages Experience:

Queens, NY

Stamford and Meriden, CT

Cleveland, OH

Los Angeles, CA and surrounding areas



Record demands and system limitations
resulted in:

Voltage reductions

Calls for conservation measures

Load curtailments

e.g., Stage 2 in Cal ISO and MISO

Consideration of rolling blackouts

29 July 2006

It is not just temperature records that are being smashed by the
nationwide heat wave; significant bits of America's electricity power-
supply system are breaking too. Across the country, hundreds of
thousands of people are being united in an air-conditioner-less,
candlelit sweat...

In Queens, several thousand New Yorkers have been without power for
ten days.  At one stage, 100,000 people were blacked out... Over in St
Louis, Missouri, at one point last weekend, over 1m people were
without electricity... Meanwhile in California, where occasional
blackouts have long been a fact of life, over 1.5m people have suffered
sporadic power cuts during some of the hottest days of the year. On
July 24th, a power failure even briefly knocked out the fashionable
online community MySpace, which is based in Los Angeles...

It is tempting to draw a simple connection between the record
temperatures and the record demand for electricity-on July 18th,
America consumed more electricity in a single day than ever before-
and conclude that the country's grid is unable to cope...

"Although there have been no cascading blackouts reported, the strain on the country's electric system in
times of high demand proves the need for new power plants that can increase supplies and new
transmission investment to ensure that power can be shipped to consumers." - FERC Chairman (7/18/06)

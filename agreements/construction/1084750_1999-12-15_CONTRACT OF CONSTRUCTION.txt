1.1  BASIC DEFINITIONS

1.1.1  THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

The Contract Documents consist of the Agreement between Owner and Contractor
(hereinafter the Agreement), Conditions of the Contract (General, Supplementary
and other Conditions), Drawings, Specifications, Addenda issued prior to
execution of the Contract, other documents listed in the Agreement and
modifications issued after execution of the Contract. A Modification is (1) a
written amendment to the Contract signed by both parties, (2) a Change Order,

the Work issued by the Architect. Unless specifically enumerated in the
Agreement, the Contract Documents do not include other documents such as bidding
requirements (advertisement or invitation to bid, Instructions to Bidders,
sample forms, the Contractor's bid or portions of Addenda relating to bidding
requirements).

1.1.2  THE CONTRACT

The Contract Documents form the Contract for Construction. The Contract
represents the entire and integrated agreement between the parties hereto and
supersedes prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either written or
oral. The Contract may be amended or modified only by a Modification. The
Contract Documents shall not be construed to create a contractual relationship
of any kind (1) [TEXT DELETED] (2) between the Owner and a Subcontractor or Sub-
subcontractor, (3) between the Owner and Architect or (4) between any persons or
entities other than the Owner and Contractor. [TEXT DELETED].

The Project Manual is a volume assembled for the Work which may include the
bidding requirements, sample forms, Conditions of the Contract and
Specifications.

1.2  CORRELATION AND INTENT OF THE CONTRACT DOCUMENTS

1.2.1  The intent of the Contract Documents is to include all
items necessary for the proper execution and completion of the Work by the
Contractor. The Contract Documents are complementary, and what is required by
one shall be as binding as if required by all; performance by the Contractor
shall be required only to the extent consistent with the Contract Documents and
reasonably inerrable from them as being necessary to produce the indicated
results.

1.2.2  Organization of the Specifications into divisions,
sections and articles, and arrangement of Drawings shall not control the
Contractor in dividing the Work among Subcontractors or in establishing the
extent of Work to be performed by any trade.

5.   SUBCONTRACTORS

5.1  DEFINITIONS

5.1.1  A Subcontractor is a person or entity who has a direct
contract with the Contractor to perform a portion of the work at the site. The
term "Subcontractor" is referred to throughout the Contract Documents as if
singular in number and means a Subcontractor or an authorized representative of
the Subcontractor. The term "Subcontractor" does not include a separate
contractor or subcontractors of a separate contractor.

5.1.2  A Sub-subcontractor is a person or entity who has a direct
or indirect contract with a Subcontractor to perform a portion of the Work at
the site. The term "Sub-subcontractor" is referred to throughout the Contract
Documents as if singular in number and means a Sub-subcontractor or an
authorized representative of the Sub-subcontractor.

5.2  AWARD OF SUBCONTRACTS AND OTHER CONTRACTS FOR PORTIONS OF THE
WORK

5.2.1  [TEXT DELETED]. The Contractor, as soon as practicable
after award of the Contract, shall furnish in writing to the Owner [TEXT
DELETED] the names of persons or entities (including those who are to furnish
materials or equipment fabricated to a special design) proposed for each
principal
<PAGE>

portion of the Work. The [TEXT DELETED] Owner will promptly reply to the
Contractor in writing stating whether or not the Owner [TEXT DELETED], after due
investigation, has reasonable objection to any such proposed person or entity.
[TEXT DELETED]

5.2.2  The Contractor shall not contract with a proposed person
or entity to whom the Owner [TEXT DELETED] has made reasonable and timely
objection. The Contractor shall not be required to contract with anyone to whom
the Contractor has made reasonable objection.


5.2.3  If the Owner [TEXT DELETED ] has reasonable objection to a
person or entity proposed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall propose
another to whom the Owner [TEXT DELETED] has no reasonable objection. If the
proposed but rejected Subcontractor was reasonably capable of performing the
Work, the Contract Sum and Contract Time shall be increased or decreased by the
difference, if any, occasioned by such change, and an appropriate Change Order
shall be issued before commencement of the substitute Subcontractor's work.
However, no increase in the Contract Sum or Contract Time shall be allowed for
such change unless the Contractor has acted promptly and responsively in
submitting names as required.

5.3  SUBCONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

5.3.1  By appropriate written agreement, [TEXT DELETED] the
Contractor shall require each Subcontractor, to the extent of the Work to be
performed by the Subcontractor, to be bound to the Contractor by terms of the
Contract Documents, and to assume toward the Contractor all the obligations and
responsibilities, including the responsibility for safety of the Subcontractor's
Work, which the Contractor, by these Documents, assumes toward the Owner [TEXT
DELETED]. Each subcontract agreement shall preserve and protect the rights of
the Owner [TEXT DELETED] under the Contract Documents with respect to the Work
to be performed by the Subcontractor so that subcontracting thereof will not
prejudice such rights, and shall allow to the Subcontractor, unless specifically
provided otherwise in the subcontract agreement, the benefit of all rights,
remedies and redress against the Contractor that the Contractor, by the Contract
Documents, has against
<PAGE>

the Owner. Where appropriate, the Contractor shall require each Subcontractor to
enter into similar agreements with Sub-subcontractors. The Contractor shall make
available to each proposed Subcontractor, prior to the execution of the
subcontract agreement, copies of the Contract Documents to which the
Subcontractor will be bound, and, upon written request of the Subcontractor,
identify to the Subcontractor terms and conditions of the proposed subcontract
agreement which may be at variance with the Contract Documents. Subcontractors
will similarly make copies of applicable portions of such documents available to
their respective proposed Sub-subcontractors.


5.4  CONTINGENT ASSIGNMENT OF  SUBCONTRACTS

5.4.1 Each subcontract agreement for a portion of the Work is

the Contract by the Owner for cause pursuant to Paragraph 14.2 and only for
those subcontract agreements which the Owner accepts by notifying the
Subcontractor and Contractor in writing; and

5.4.1.2  assignment is subject to the prior rights of the
surety, if any, obligated under bond relating to the Contract.

5.4.2  Upon such assignment, if the Work has been suspended for
more than 30 days, the Subcontractor's compensation shall be equitably adjusted
for increases in cost resulting from the suspension.

6.1  OWNER'S RIGHT TO PERFORM CONSTRUCTION AND TO AWARD SEPARATE
CONTRACTS

6.1.1  The Owner reserves the right to perform construction or
operations related to the Project with the Owner's own forces, and to award
separate contracts in connection with other portions of the Project or other
construction or
<PAGE>

operations on the site under Conditions of the Contract identical or
substantially similar to these including those portions related to insurance and
waiver of subrogation. If the Contractor claims that delay or additional cost is
involved because of such action by the Owner, the Contractor shall make such
Claim as provided in Paragraph 4.3.

6.1.2  When separate contracts are awarded for different portions
of the Project or other construction or operations on the site, the term
"Contractor" in the Contract Documents in each case shall mean the Contractor
who executes each separate Owner-Contractor Agreement.

6.1.3  [TEXT DELETED]. The Contractor shall make any revisions to
the construction schedule deemed necessary after a joint review and mutual
agreement. The construction schedules shall then constitute the schedules to be
used by the Contractor, separate contractors and the Other until subsequently
revised.

6.1.4  Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents, when
the Owner performs construction or operations related to the Project and the
Owner's own forces, the Owner shall be deemed to be subject to the same
obligations and to have the same rights which apply to the Contractor under the
Conditions of the Contract, including, without excluding others, those stated in
Article 3, this Article 6 and Articles 10, 11 and 12.

6.2  MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY

6.2.1  The Contractor shall afford the Owner and separate
contractors reasonable opportunity for introduction and storage of their
materials and equipment and performance of their activities, and shall connect
and coordinate the Contractor's construction and operations with theirs as
required by the Contract documents.

6.2.2  If part of the Contractor's Work depends for proper
execution or results upon construction or operations by the Owner or a separate
contractor, the Contractor shall, prior to proceeding with that portion of the
Work,
<PAGE>

promptly report to the [TEXT DELETED] apparent discrepancies or defects in such
other construction that would render it unsuitable for such proper execution and
results. Failure of the contractor so to report shall constitute an
acknowledgment that the Owner's or separate contractor's completed or partially
completed construction is fit and proper to receive the Contractor's Work,
except as to defects not then reasonably discoverable.

6.2.3  The Owner shall be reimbursed by the Contractor for costs
incurred by the Owner which are payable to a separate contractor because of
delays, improperly timed activities or defective construction of the Contractor.
The Owner shall be responsible to the Contractor for costs incurred by the
Contractor because of delays, improperly timed activities, damage to the Work or

6.3  OWNER'S RIGHT TO CLEAN UP

6.3.1  If a dispute arises among the Contractor, separate
contractors and the Owner as to the responsibility under their respective
contracts for maintaining the premises and surrounding area free from waste
materials and rubbish, the Owner may clean up and [TEXT DELETED] allocate the

7.1  GENERAL

<PAGE>

7.1.1  Changes in the Work may be accomplished after execution of
the Contract, and without invalidating the Contract, by Change Order,
Construction Change Directive or order for a minor change in the Work, subject
to the limitations stated in this Article 7 and elsewhere in the Contract
Documents.

7.1.2  A Change Order shall be based upon agreement among the
Owner, and Contractor [TEXT DELETED] a Construction Change Directive requires
agreement by the Owner [TEXT DELETED] and may or may not be agreed to by the
Contractor; an order for a minor change in the Work may be issued by the [TEXT
DELETED] Owner alone.

7.1.3  Changes in the Work shall be performed under applicable
provisions of the Contract Documents, and the Contractor shall proceed promptly,
unless otherwise provided in the Change Order, Construction Change Directive or
order for a minor change in the Work.

7.2  CHANGE ORDERS

7.2.1  [TEXT DELETED]

7.2.2  Methods used in determining adjustments to the Contract
Sum may include those listed in Subparagraph 7.3.3.

7.3  CONSTRUCTION CHANGE DIRECTIVES

7.3.1  A Construction Change Directive is a written order [TEXT
DELETED] signed by the Owner [TEXT DELETED], directing a change in the Work
prior to the agreement on adjustment, if any, in the Contract sum or Contract
Time, or both. The Owner may by Construction Change Directive, without
invalidating the Contract, order changes in the Work within the general scope of
the Contract consisting of additions, deletions or other revisions, the Contract
Sum and Contract Time being adjusted accordingly.

7.3.2  A Construction Change Directive shall be used in the
absence of total agreement on the terms of a Change Order.
<PAGE>

7.3.3  If the Construction Change Directive provides for an
adjustment to the Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be based on one of the
following methods:

.1   mutual acceptance of a lump sum properly itemized and supported
by sufficient substantiating data to permit evaluation;

.2   unit prices stated in the Contract Documents or subsequently
agreed upon

.3   cost to be determined in a manner agreed upon by the parties and
a mutually acceptable fixed or percentage fee; or

.4   as provided in Subparagraph 7.3.6.

7.3.4  Upon receipt of a Construction Change Directive, the
Contractor shall promptly proceed with the change in the Work involved and
advise the [TEXT DELETED] Owner of the Contractor's agreement or disagreement
with the method, if any, provided in the Construction Change Directive for
determining the proposed adjustment in the Contract Sum or Contract Time.

7.3.5  A Construction Change Directive signed by the Contractor
indicates the agreement of the Contractor therewith, including adjustment in
Contract Sum and Contract Time or the method for determining them. Such
agreement shall be effective immediately and shall be recorded as a Change
Order.

7.3.6  If the Contractor does not respond promptly or disagrees
with the method for adjustment in the Contract Sum, the method and the
adjustment shall be determined by the Architect on the basis of reasonable
expenditures and savings of those performing the Work attributable to the
change, including, in the case of an increase in the Contract Sum, a reasonable
allowance for overhead and profit. In such case, and also under Clause 7.3.3.3,
the Contractor shall keep and present, in such form as the Architect may
prescribe, an itemized accounting together with appropriate supporting data.
Unless otherwise provided in the Contract Docu-
<PAGE>

ments, costs for the purposes of this Subparagraph 7.3.6 shall be limited to the
following:

.1   costs of labor, including social security, old age and
unemployment insurance, fringe benefits required by agreement or
custom, and workers' compensation insurance;

.2   costs of materials, supplies and equipment, including cost of
transportation, whether incorporated or consumed;

.3   rental costs of machinery and equipment, exclusive of hand tools,
whether rented from the Contractor or others;

.4   costs of premiums for all bonds and insurance, permit fees, and
sales, use of similar taxes related to the Work; and

.5   additional costs of supervision and field office personnel
directly attributable to the change.

7.3.7  The amount of credit to be allowed by the Contractor to
the Owner for a deletion or change which results in a net decrease in the
Contract Sum shall be actual net cost [TEXT DELETED]. When both additions and
credits covering related Work or substitutions are involved in a change, the
allowance for overhead and profit shall be figured on the basis of net increase,
if any, with respect to that change.

7.3.8  Pending final determination of the total cost of a
Construction Change Directive to the Owner, amounts not in dispute for such
changes in the Work shall be included in Applications for Payment accompanied by
a Change Order indicating the parties' agreement with part or all of such costs.
[TEXT  DELETED]


7.3.9   When the Owner and Contractor agree with [TEXT DELETED]
the adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract Time, or otherwise reach
agreement upon the adjustments, such agreement shall be effective immedi-
<PAGE>

ately and shall be recorded by preparation and execution of an appropriate
Change Order.

and shall include the costs of applicable insurance, storage and transportation
to the site for such materials and equipment stored off the site.

9.7.1  [TEXT DELETED]

9.8  SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

9.8.1  [TEXT DELETED]

thereof which the Owner agrees to accept separately, is substantially complete,
the Contractor shall prepare and submit to the Owner [TEXT DELETED] a
comprehensive list of items to be completed or corrected prior to final payment.
Failure to include an item on such list does not alter the responsibility of the
Contractor to complete all Work in accordance with the Contract Documents.

9.8.3  Upon receipt of the Contractor's list, the [TEXT DELETED]
Owner will make an inspection to determine whether the Work or designated
portion thereof is substantially complete. If the [TEXT DELETED] Owner's
inspection discloses any item, whether or not included on the Contractor's list,
which is not sufficiently complete in accordance with the Contract Documents so
that the
<PAGE>

Owner can occupy or utilize the Work or designated portion thereof for its
intended use, the Contractor shall, before insurance of the Certificate of
Substantial Completion, complete or correct such item upon notification by the
[TEXT DELETED] Owner. In such case, the Contractor shall then submit a request

shall commence on the date of Substantial Completion of the Work or designated
portion thereof, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Substantial
Completion.

submitted to the [TEXT DELETED] Contractor for [TEXT DELETED] its written
acceptance of responsibilities assigned to them in such Certificate. Upon such
acceptance and consent of surety, if any Upon Substantial Completion of the Work

portion thereof. such payment shall be adjusted for Work that is incomplete or
not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.

9.9  PARTIAL OCCUPANCY OR USE

9.9.1  The Owner may occupy or use any completed or partially
completed portion of the Work at any stage when such portion is designated by
separate agreement with the Contractor, provided such occupancy or use is
consented to by the insurer as required under Clause 11.4.1.5 and authorized by
public authorities having jurisdiction over the Work. Such partial occupancy or
use may commence whether or not the portion is substantially complete, provided
the Owner and Contractor have accepted in writing the responsibilities assigned
to each of them for payments, retainage, if any, security, maintenance, heat,
utilities, damage to the Work and insurance, and have agreed in writing
concerning the period for correction
<PAGE>

of the Work and commencement of warranties required by the Contract Documents.
When the Contractor considers a portion substantially complete, the Contractor
shall prepare and submit a list to the [TEXT DELETED] Owner [TEXT DELETED].

or portion of the Work to be used in order to determine and record the condition
of the Work.

9.9.3  Unless otherwise agreed upon, partial occupancy or use of
a portion or portions of the Work shall not constitute acceptance of Work not
complying with the requirements of the Contract Documents.

9.10 FINAL COMPLETION AND FINAL PAYMENT

9.10.1 [TEXT DELETED]

9.10.2 neither final payment nor any remaining retained
percentage shall become due until the Contractor submits to the [TEXT DELETED]
Owner (1) an affidavit that payrolls, bills for materials and equipment, and
other indebtedness connected with the Work for which the Owner or the Owner's
property might be responsible or encumbered (less amounts withheld by Owner)
have been paid or otherwise satisfied, (2) a certificate evidencing that
insurance required by the Contract Documents to remain in force after final
payment is currently in effect and will not be canceled or allowed to expire
until at lease 30 days' prior written notice has been given to the Owner, (3) a
written statement that the Contractor knows of no substantial reason that the
insurance will not be renewable to cover the period required by the Contract
Documents, (4) consent of surety, if any, to final payment and (5), if required
by the Owner, other data establishing payment or satisfaction of obligations,
such as receipts, releases and waivers of liens, claims, security interests or
encumbrances arising out of the Contract, to the extent and in such form as may
be designated by the Owner. If a Subcontractor refuses to furnish a release or
waiver
<PAGE>

required by the Owner, the Contractor may furnish a bond satisfactory to the
Owner to indemnify the Owner against such lien. If such lien remains unsatisfied
after payments are made, the Contractor shall refund to the Owner all money that
the Owner may be compelled to pay in discharging such lien, including all costs
and reasonable attorneys' fees.

9.10.3  If, after Substantial Completion of the Work, final
completion thereof is materially delayed through no fault of the Contractor or
by issuance of Change Orders affecting final completion, [TEXT DELETED] the
Owner shall, upon application by the Contractor [TEXT DELETED], and without
terminating the Contract, make payment of the balance due for that portion of
the Work fully completed and accepted. If the remaining balance for Work not
fully completed or corrected is less than retainage stipulated in the Contract
Documents, and if bonds have been furnished, the written consent of surety to
payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed and
accepted shall be submitted by the [TEXT DELETED] Contractor to the [TEXT
DELETED] Owner prior to [DELETE- certification of] such payment. Such payment
shall be made under terms and conditions governing final payment, except that it
shall not constitute a waiver of claims.

9.10.4  The making of final payment shall constitute a waiver of
Claims by the Owner except those arising from:

.1   liens, Claims, security interests or encumbrances arising out of
the Contract and unsettled;

.2   failure of the Work to comply with the requirements of the
Contract Documents; or

.3   terms of special warranties required by the Contract Documents.
<PAGE>

which the Project is located such insurance as will protect the Contractor and
Owner from claims set forth below which may arise out of or result from the

be filed with the Owner prior to commencement of the Work. These certificates
and the insurance policies required by this Paragraph 11.1 shall contain a
provision that coverages afforded under the policies will not be canceled or

the Owner. If any of the foregoing insurance coverages are required to remain in
force after final payment and are reasonably available, an additional
certificate evidencing continuation of such coverage shall be submitted with the
final Application for Payment as required by Subparagraph 9.10.2. Information
concerning reduction of coverage on account of revised limits or claims paid

11.2 OWNER'S LIABILITY INSURANCE

11.2.1  The Owner shall be responsible for purchasing and
maintaining the Owner's usual liability insurance.

11.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROTECTIVE LIABILITY INSURANCE

11.3.1  Optionally, the Owner may require the Contractor to
purchase and maintain Project Management Protective Liability insurance from the
Contractor's usual sources as primary coverage for the Owner's, Contractor's and
Architect's vicarious liability for construction operations under the Contract.
Unless otherwise required by the Contract Documents, the Owner shall reimburse
the Contractor by increasing the Contract Sum to pay the cost of purchasing and
maintaining such optional insurance coverage, and the Contractor shall not be
responsible
<PAGE>

for purchasing any other liability insurance on behalf of the Owner.
The minimum limits of liability purchased with such coverage shall be equal to
the aggregate of the limits required for Contractor's Liability Insurance under
Clauses 11.1.1.2 through 11.1.1.5.

11.3.2  To the extent damages are covered by Project management
Protective Liability insurance, the Owner, Contractor and Architect waive all

Owner, Architect or other persons or entities as additional insureds on the
Contractor's Liability Insurance coverage under Paragraph 11.1.

11.4 PROPERTY INSURANCE

11.4.1  Unless otherwise provided, the Owner shall purchase and
maintain, in a company or companies lawfully authorized to do business in the
jurisdiction in which the Project is located, property insurance written on a
builder's risk "all-risk" or equivalent policy form in the amount of the initial
Contract Sum, plus value of subsequent Contract modifications and cost of
materials supplied or installed by others, comprising total value for the entire
Project at the site on a replacement cost basis without optical deductibles.
Such property insurance shall be maintained, unless otherwise provided in the
Contract Documents or otherwise agreed in writing by all persons and entities
who are beneficiaries of such insurance, until final payment has been made as
provided in Paragraph 9.10 or until no person or entity other than the Owner has
an insurable interest in the property required by this Paragraph 11.4 to be
covered, whichever is later. This insurance shall include interests of the
Owner, the Contractor, Subcontractors, and Sub-subcontractors in the Project.

11.4.1.1  Property insurance shall be on an "all-risk" or
equivalent policy form and shall include, without limitation, insurance against
the perils of fire (with extended coverage) and physical loss or damage

earthquake, flood, windstorm, falsework, testing and startup, temporary
buildings and debris removal including demolition occasioned by enforcement of
any applicable legal requirements, and shall cover reasonable compensation for
Architect's and Contractor's services and expenses required as a result of such
insured loss.

11.4.1.2  If the Owner does not intend to purchase such
property insurance required by the Contract and with all of the coverages in the
amount described above, the Owner shall so inform the Contractor in writing
prior to commencement of the Work. The Contractor may then effect insurance
which will protect the interests of the contractor, Subcontractors and Sub-
subcontractors in the Work, and by appropriate Change Order the cost thereof
shall be charged to the Owner. If the Contractor is damaged by the failure or
neglect of the Owner to purchase or maintain insurance as described above,
without so notifying the Contractor in writing, then the Owner shall bear all
reasonable costs properly attributable thereto.

11.4.1.3  If the property insurance requires deductibles,
the Owner shall pay costs not covered because of such deductibles.

11.4.1.4  This property insurance shall cover portions of
the Work stored off the site, and also portions of the Work in transit.

11.4.1.5  Partial occupancy or use in accordance with
Paragraph 9.9 shall not commence until the insurance company or companies
providing property insurance have consented to such partial occupancy or use by
endorsement or otherwise. The Owner and the Contractor shall take reasonable
steps to obtain consent of the insurance company or companies and shall, without
mutual written consent, take no action with respect to partial occupancy or use
that would cause cancellation, lapse or reduction of insurance.

11.4.2  Boiler and Machinery Insurance. The Owner shall purchase
and maintain boiler and machinery insurance required by the Contract Document or
by law, which shall specifically cover such insured objects during installation
and until final acceptance by the Owner, this insurance shall include
<PAGE>

interests of the Owner, Contractor, Subcontractors and Sub-subcontractors in the
Work, and the Owner and Contractor shall be named insureds.

11.4.3  Loss of Insurance. The Owner, at the Owner's option, may
purchase and maintain such insurance as will insure the Owner against loss of
use of the Owner's property due to fire or other hazards, however caused. The
Owner waives all rights of action against the Contractor for loss of use of the
Owner's property, including consequential losses due to fire or other hazards
however caused.

11.4.4  If the Contractor requests in writing that insurance for
risks other than those described herein or other special causes of loss be
included in the property insurance policy, the Owner shall, if possible, include
such insurance, and the cost thereof shall be charged to the Contractor by
appropriate Change Order.

11.4.5  If during the Project construction period the Owner
insures properties, real or personal or both, at or adjacent to the site by
property insurance under policies separate from those insuring the Project, or
if after final payment property insurance is to be provided on the completed
Project through a policy or policies other than those insuring the Project
during the construction period, the Owner shall waive all rights in accordance
with the terms of Subparagraph 11.4.7 for damages caused by fire or other causes
of loss covered by this separate property insurance. All separate policies shall
provide this waiver of subrogation by endorsement or otherwise.

11.4.6  Before an exposure to loss may occur, the Owner shall
file with the Contractor a copy of each policy that includes insurance coverages
required by this Paragraph 11.4. Each policy shall contain all generally
applicable conditions, definitions, exclusions and endorsements related to this
Project. Each policy shall contain a provision that the policy will not be
canceled or allowed to expire, and that its limits will not be reduced, until at
least 30 days' prior written notice has been given to the Contractor.

11.4.7  Waivers of Subrogation. The Owner and Contractor waive
all rights against (1) each other and any of their subcontractors, sub-subcon-
<PAGE>

tractors, agents and employees, each of the other, and (2) the Architect,
Architect's consultants, separate contractors described in Article 6, if any,
and any of their subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, agents and employees, for
damages caused by fire or other causes of loss to the extent covered by property
insurance obtained pursuant to this Paragraph 11.4 or other property insurance
applicable to the Work, except such rights as they have to proceeds of such
insurance held by the Owner as fiduciary. The Owner or Contractor, as
appropriate, shall required of the Architect, Architect's consultants, separate
contractors described in Article 6, if any, and the subcontractors, sub-
subcontractors, agents and employees of any of them, by appropriate agreements,
written where legally required for validity, similar waivers each in favor of
other parties enumerated herein. the policies shall provide such waivers of
subrogation by endorsement or otherwise. A waiver of subrogation shall be
effective as to a person or entity even though that person or entity would
otherwise have a duty of indemnification, contractual or otherwise, did not pay
the insurance premium directly or indirectly, and whether or not the person or
entity had an insurable interest in the property damaged.

11.4.8  A loss insured under Owner's property insurance shall be
adjusted by the Owner as fiduciary and made payable to the Owner as fiduciary
for the insureds, as their interests may appear, subject to requirements of any
applicable mortgagee clause and of Subparagraph 11.4.10. The Contractor shall
pay Subcontractors their just shares of insurance proceeds received by the
Contractor, and by appropriate agreements, written where legally required for
validity, shall require Subcontractors to make payments to their Sub-
subcontractors in similar manner.

11.4.9  If required in writing by a party in interest, the Owner
as fiduciary shall, upon occurrence of an insured loss, give bond for proper
performance of the Owner's duties. The cost of required bonds shall be charged
against proceeds received as fiduciary. The Owner shall deposit in a separate
account proceeds so received, which the Owner shall distribute in accordance
with such agreement as the parties in interest may reach, or in accordance with
an arbitration award in which case the procedure shall be as provided in
Paragraph 4.6. If after such loss not other special agreement is made and unless
the Owner terminates the Contract for conve-
<PAGE>

nience, replacement of damaged property shall be performed by the Contractor
after notification of a Change in the Work in accordance with Article 7.

11.4.10 The Owner as fiduciary shall have power to adjust and
settle a loss with insurers unless one of the parties in interest shall object
in writing within five days after occurrence of loss to the Owner's exercise of
this power, if such objection is made, the dispute shall be resolved as provided
in Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.6. The Owner as fiduciary shall, in the case of
arbitration, make settlement with insurers in accordance with directions of the
arbitrators. If distribution of insurance proceeds by arbitration is required,
the arbitrators will direct such distribution.

11.5 PERFORMANCE BOND AND PAYMENT BOND

to furnish bonds covering faithful performance of the Contract and payment of
obligations arising thereunder as stipulated in bidding requirements or
specifically required in the Contract Documents on the date of execution of the
Contract.

a potential beneficiary of bonds covering payment of obligations arising under

12.  UNCOVERING AND CORRECTION OF WORK

12.1 UNCOVERING OF WORK

12.1.1  If a portion of the Work is covered contrary to the [TEXT
DELETED] requirements specifically expressed in the Contract Documents, it must,
if required in writing by the [TEXT DELETED] requirements specifically expressed
in the Contract Documents, it must, if required in writing by the [TEXT DELETED]
Owner be uncovered for the [TEXT DELETED] Owner's examination and be replaced at
the Contractor's expense without change in the Contract Time.
<PAGE>

12.1.2  If a portion of the Work has been covered with the [TEXT
DELETED] Owner has not specifically requested to examine prior to its being
covered, the [TEXT DELETED] Owner may request to see such Work and it shall be
uncovered by the Contractor. If such Work is in accordance with the Contract
Documents, costs of uncovering and replacement shall, by appropriate Change
Order, be at the Owner's expense. if such Work is not in accordance with the
Contract Documents, correction shall be at the Contractor's expense unless the
condition was caused by the Owner or a separate contractor in which event the
Owner shall be responsible for payment of such costs.

12.2 CORRECTION OF WORK

12.2.1  BEFORE OR AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

12.2.1.1  The Contractor shall promptly correct Work
reject by the [TEXT DELETED] Owner or failing to conform to the requirements of
the contract Documents, whether discovered before or after Substantial
Completion and whether or not fabricated, installed or completed. Costs of
correcting such rejected Work, including additional testing and inspections and
[TEXT DELETED] expenses made necessary thereby, shall be at the Contractor's
expense.

12.2.2  AFTER SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION

12.2.2.1  In addition to the contractor's obligations
under Paragraph 3.5, if, within one year after the date of Substantial
Completion of the Work or designated portion thereof or after the date for
commencement of warranties established under Subparagraph 9.9.1, or by terms of
an applicable special warranty required by the Contract Documents, any of the
Work is found to be not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract
Documents, the Contractor shall correct it promptly after receipt of written
notice from the Owner to do so unless the Owner has previously given the
Contractor a written acceptance of such condition. The Owner shall give such
notice promptly after discovery of the condition. During the one-year period for
correction of Work, if the Owner fails to notify the contractor and give the
Contractor an opportunity to make the correction, the Owner waives the rights to
require correction by the Contractor and to make a claim for breach of
<PAGE>

warranty. If the Contractor fails to correct nonconforming Work within a
reasonable time during that period after receipt of notice from the Owner [TEXT
DELETED], the Owner may correct it in accordance with Paragraph 2.4.

12.2.2.2   The one-year period for correction of Work
shall be extended with respect to portions of Work first performed after

the actual performance of the Work.

12.2.2.3  [TEXT DELETED]

destroyed or damaged construction, whether completed or partially completed, of
the Owner or separate contractors caused by the Contractor's correction or
removal of Work which is not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract

12.2.5  Nothing contained in this Paragraph 12.2 shall be
construed to establish a period of limitation with respect to other obligations
which the contractor might have under the Contract Documents. Establishment of
the one-year period for correction of Work as described in Subparagraph 12.2.2
relates only to the specific obligation of the contractor to correct the Work,
and has no relationship to the time within which the obligation to comply with
the Contract Documents may be sought to be enforced, nor to the time within
which proceedings may be commenced to establish the Contractor's liability with
respect to the Contractor's obligations other than specifically to correct the
Work.

12.3 ACCEPTANCE OF NONCONFORMING WORK

12.3.1  If the Owner prefers to accept Work which is not in
accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the Owner may do so
instead of requiring its removal and correction, in which case the Contract Sum
will
<PAGE>

be reduced as appropriate and equitable. Such adjustment shall be effected
whether or not final payment has been made.

<PAGE>

limitation of duties, obligations, rights and remedies otherwise imposed or
available by law.

13.4.2  No action or failure to act by the Owner, [TEXT DELETED]
or Contractor shall constitute a waiver of a right or duty afforded them under
the Contract, nor shall such action or failure to act constitute approval of or
acquiescence in a breach thereunder, except as may be specifically agreed in
writing.

13.5 TESTS AND INSPECTIONS

required by the Contract Documents or by laws, ordinances, rules, regulations or

the Design/Builder's liability with respect to the Design/Builder's obligations
other than specifically to correct the Work.

9.4    If the Design/Builder fails to correct nonconforming Work as required or
fails to carry out Work in accordance with the Contract Documents, the Owner, by
written order signed personally or by an agent specifically so empowered by the
Owner in writing, may order the Design/Builder to stop the Work, or any portion
thereof, until the cause for such order has been eliminated; however, the
Owner's right to stop the Work shall not give rise to a duty on the part of the
Owner to exercise the right for benefit of the Design/Builder or other persons
or entities.

9.5    If the Design/Builder defaults or neglects to carry out the Work in
accordance with the Contract Documents and fails within seven (7) days after the

such default or neglect with diligence and promptness, the Owner may give a
second written notice to the Design/Builder and seven (7) days following receipt
by the Design/Builder of that second written notice and without prejudice to
other remedies, the Owner may have, correct such deficiencies.  In such case an
appropriate Change Order shall be issued deducting from payments then or
thereafter due the Design Builder, the costs of correcting such deficiencies.
If the payments then or thereafter due the Design/Builder are not sufficient to
cover the amount of the deduction, the Design/Builder shall pay the difference
to the Owner.  Such action by the Owner shall be subject to dispute resolution
procedures as provided in Article 10.

Add the following at the end of Subparagraph 7.1.1:

The parties hereby acknowledge the Project is being designed and built on a
so-called "fast track" basis.  As such, the Drawings and Specifications are

Specifications may require multiple rounds of drafting, review, comments,
changes and modifications.  The Project Construction Budget, and the
Project Schedule (including the date of Substantial Completion) shall be
subject to adjustment in connection with such changes and modifications to
the Drawings and Specifications.  However, subject to the provisions of
Section 7.2.1, no such change or modification to the Drawings and
Specifications shall constitute (or require) a "Change Order" or entitle
Contractor to any claim for an adjustment to Contractor's cost and fee,
notwithstanding whether any such change or modification requires
alteration, removal, replacement or reperformance of Work that has been
completed, provided the Work requested can be completed by the date of
11/1/99.  Should the "Change Order" cause an extension of Contractor
service beyond the date of 11/1/99, the Contractor will provide a revised

calculation as per the terms of Article 17.2.1.

or reasonably inferable therefrom.  If any item or material shown on the
Drawings is omitted from or excepted in the Specifications, or vice versa,
or if any omitted item or material is inferable to complete the detail
shown or specified, Contractor shall, without any increase in the Contract
Sum or extension of the Contract Time, furnish and install such item or
material of type and quality as established by the balance of the detail
shown and specified.

7.1.5  Contractor represents and warrants that, to the extent reasonable
under the circumstances, it has studied and familiarized itself with the
Contract Documents and the site and the utility services provided thereto.
Any change in the Work required because Contractor failed to anticipate or
discover a condition at the site or failed to anticipate or discover that
the utility services to the site or the Contract Documents are insufficient
to complete the Work, which change could have been avoided had Contractor
properly studied and familiarized itself with the Contract Documents and
the site and the utility services provided thereto, shall not result in any
increase in the Contract Sum or extension of the Contract Time.

7.1.6  If the adjustment to the Contract Sum resulting from a change in the
Work is determined under Paragraph 7.3.6, the following shall apply:

.1  The cost of the Work shall include an allowance for Contractor's
overhead or profit in the form of an adjustment in Contractor's
Fee (but only in accordance with Article 17 hereof) pursuant to
the terms of the Contract, subject to Owner's approval in all
cases.

architect and engineer), but not by Sub-subcontractors, the
Subcontractors' allowance for overhead and profit shall not
exceed 15% of direct costs.

a Change in the Project or the method or manner of performance and/or an
adjustment in the Project Construction Budget or the Substantial Completion
Date. Subcontractors shall be entitled to adjustment of their fees and
costs for Change Order work in accordance with the terms of their
respective Subcontracts. The Contractor shall be entitled to compensation
for all Costs of the Project incurred by Contractor in connection with the
applicable Change Order work as per the parameters outlined in Section
7.1.1 above.

In the second and fifth lines of Subparagraph 7.3.6 change "Architect" to
"Owner."

Add the following new Subparagraph at the end of Paragraph 7.3:

7.3.10  Contractor shall submit to Owner, within seven (7) days after a
written request therefor from Owner or within seven (7) days after an order
to proceed with a change in the Work pending issuance of a Change Order, an
accurate written estimate of any increase or decrease in costs and of any
delay in the time of completion that will result from the proposed change.

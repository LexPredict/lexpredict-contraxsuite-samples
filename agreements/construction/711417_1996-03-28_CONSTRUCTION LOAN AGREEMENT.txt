change order to Lender together with a cover letter specifying that Lender is to
reply within fifteen (15) days of its receipt thereof pursuant to this Section
4.05, Lender shall be deemed to have approved such change order if it fails to
object in writing within fifteen (15) days of Lender's receipt of any such
change order and notice. Upon Lender's request, Borrower, the project architect,
and the general contractor (if any), shall initial the copy of the Plans and
Specifications delivered to, and approved by, Lender as a true copy of the Plans
and Specifications for the Work. Borrower shall maintain at all times a full set
of working drawings for the Work available for inspection by Lender.

Notwithstanding the above, Borrower may make minor changes in the Plans and
Specifications without Lender's prior written consent unless such change: (i)
constitutes a material change in the building material or equipment
specifications, the architectural or structural design, value, architecture, or
quality of any of the Improvements; or (ii) would result in an increase in any
item of construction cost in excess of TEN THOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS
($10,000.00) for any single change or in excess of FIFTY THOUSAND AND NO/100THS
DOLLARS ($50,000.00) for all such changes in such items of construction cost; or
(iii) would affect the structural integrity, quality of building material or
equipment or overall efficiency of operating systems or utility systems of the
Improvements; or (iv) requires the approval (which has not been given as of the
date of any such change) of any Governmental Agency or any other person or
entity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall submit all proposed
changes to the Plans and Specifications to Lender at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the commencement of construction relating to such proposed change
whether or not any such change is subject to Lender's approval.

4.06 CONSTRUCTION INFORMATION; INSPECTIONS.  From time to time, and within
ten (10) business days of receipt from Lender of a request therefor, Borrower
shall deliver to Lender:

(a)  a complete list stating (i) the name, address and phone number of
each contractor, subcontractor and material supplier to be employed or used for
the Work, and (ii) the dollar amount, including changes if any, of each contract
and subcontract, and the portion thereof, if any, paid through the date of such
list;

(b)  copies of each contract and subcontract identified in such list,
including any changes thereto;

<PAGE>

(c)  a cost breakdown, in a form reasonably acceptable to Lender,
stating the projected total cost of the Work, and the portion, if any, of each
cost item (i) which has been incurred, and (ii) which has been paid, all as of
the date of such cost breakdown;

(d)  a construction progress schedule, in a form reasonably acceptable
to Lender, showing the progress of the Work and the projected sequencing and
completion time for uncompleted work, all as of the date of such schedule; and

(e)  with respect to any item designated above which has been
previously delivered, such update thereof as Lender may request.

Lender is expressly authorized to contact any contractor, subcontractor or
material supplier and, at all reasonable times, to enter the Property and
inspect the Improvements and the Work in order to verify information disclosed
pursuant to this Section, or for any other reasonable purpose.

4.07 PROHIBITED CONTRACTS.  Without Lender's prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Borrower shall not
contract for any materials, furnishings, equipment, fixtures or other parts or
components of the Work, or other property for the use or occupancy of the
Property or Improvements, if any third party retains or purports to retain any
interest (other than lien rights, if any, created by operation of law) in such
items after their delivery to the Property.  Borrower shall have five (5) days
to effect the removal of any such retained interest

4.08 CONTRACTORS.  Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, disapprove
any contractor, subcontractor or material supplier whom Lender deems financially
or otherwise unqualified; provided, however, that the absence of any such
disapproval shall not constitute a representation of qualifications.

4.09 LIENS AND STOP NOTICES.  If a claim of lien is recorded affecting the
Leasehold Interest or Improvements or a bonded stop notice is served upon Lender
which affects the Loan or Borrower's Funds, Borrower shall, within twenty (20)
days of such recording or service or within five (5) days of Lender's demand
(whichever occurs first), (a) pay and discharge the same, or (b) effect the
release thereof by recording or delivering to Lender a surety bond in sufficient
form and amount, or (c) otherwise provide Lender with other assurance which
Lender deems, in its sole discretion,

<PAGE>

to be satisfactory for the payment of such lien or bonded stop notice and for
the full and continuous protection of Lender from the effect of such lien or
bonded stop notice.

4.10 CONSTRUCTION RESPONSIBILITIES.  Borrower shall be solely responsible
for all aspects of Borrower's business and conduct in connection with the
Leasehold Interest and Improvements, including, without limitation, the quality
and suitability of the Plans and Specifications and their compliance with the
Requirements, the supervision of the Work, the qualifications, financial
condition and performance of all architects, engineers, contractors, material
suppliers, consultants and property managers, and the accuracy of all
applications for payment and the proper application of all disbursements.
Lender is not obligated to supervise, inspect or inform Borrower or any third
party of any aspect of the Work or any other matter referred to above.  Any
inspection or review by Lender is to determine whether Borrower is properly
discharging its obligations to Lender and may not be relied upon by Borrower or
any third party.  Lender owes no duty of care to Borrower or any third party to
protect against, or to inform Borrower or any third party of, any negligent,
faulty, inadequate or defective design or construction of the Work.

4.11 IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT.  Without Lender's prior written consent,
Borrower shall not, directly or indirectly, advocate or assist in the
incorporation of any of the Property or Improvements into any improvement or
other assessment district.

4.12 DELAY.  Borrower shall promptly notify Lender in writing of any event
causing delay or interruption of the Work, or the timely completion of the Work.
The notice shall specify the particular work delayed, and the cause and period
of each delay.

4.13 BONDS.  Within five (5) days of Lender's request, Borrower shall
procure from a surety acceptable to Lender, and deliver to Lender, dual obligee
performance and labor and material payment bonds in a form, substance and amount
reasonably acceptable to Lender and, if requested by Lender, cause any such bond
to be recorded and the Plans and Specifications and construction agreement, if
any, to be filed in the office of the County Recorder of the County where the
Property is located.

4.14 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND RESERVES.  Borrower shall not make any
capital improvement to the property other than those described in the Plans and
Specifications (as the same may be changed pursuant to Section 4.05 hereof) or
expend or reserve any income or revenue derived from the Property for any such
capital improvement without Lender's prior approval for each such capital
improvement, expenditure or reserve.

insurer reasonably satisfactory to Lender a policy of comprehensive public

satisfaction of Borrower's obligations to provide insurance.

its other obligations (in addition to those in Section 7.01(a) above) under any
of the Loan Documents within the Initial Cure Period, or, within ninety (90)
days after written notice so long as Borrower begins within the Initial Cure
Period and diligently continues to cure the failure, and Lender,

<PAGE>

exercising reasonable judgment, determines that the cure cannot reasonably be
completed at or before expiration of the Initial Cure Period; or

(c)  CONSTRUCTION; USE.  (i) Any material deviation in the Work from
the Plans and Specifications or Requirements or the appearance or use of
defective workmanship or materials in performing the Work, and Borrower's
failure to remedy the same to Lender's reasonable satisfaction within thirty
(30) days of Lender's written demand to do so; or (ii) the cessation of the Work
prior to completion for a continuous period of more than thirty (30) days,
unless such cessation is (A) a result of a casualty or taking and Borrower

of Section 5 of the Deed of Trust, or (B) caused by events for which delay may
be permitted under Section 4.02 hereof; or (iii) the curtailment in availability
to the Property or Improvements of utilities or other public services necessary
for the full occupancy and utilization of the Improvements for a continuous
period of more than thirty (30) days; or

condemnation, seizure or appropriation of, or occurrence of an uninsured
casualty with respect to any material, as determined by Lender in its sole and
absolute discretion, portion of the Property or Improvements, unless (A) within
sixty (60) days after any such condemnation, seizure or appropriation, or
occurrence of an uninsured casualty, Borrower submits to Lender a written
proposal reasonably satisfactory to Lender for the repair or restoration of the
Property or Improvements, as the case may be, using funds provided by Borrower,
such that the value of the Leasehold Interest or Improvements, as the case may
be, is not materially impaired as a result thereof, and (B) Borrower diligently
pursues such repair or restoration to completion in a good and workmanlike
manner; or

(e)  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  The failure of any of Borrower's
representations or warranties in any of the Loan Documents to be true within

management, organizational or other material change in the Borrower or the
partners or venturers thereof, including, without limitation, partnership or
joint venture disputes, which Lender

<PAGE>

determines, in its reasonable discretion, will have a material adverse effect on
the Loan, the Leasehold Interest, the security for the Loan or upon Borrower's
or its partners' and venturers' ability to perform their obligations under the
Loan Documents, without Lender's prior written consent; provided, however, that
Lender shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any (i)
distribution to any general or limited partner of Borrower of such partner's
respective interest therein or (ii) assignment or transfer by any general or
limited partner of Borrower of its respective interest so distributed to any
person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such

tax free exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and (B) any and all such Affiliates agree to assume all of the
liabilities and obligations of Borrower and such general or limited partner to
Lender pursuant to a written instrument satisfactory to Lender.

(g)  ACCELERATION UPON LOSS OF SECURITY.  If at any time the Deed of
Trust ceases to be a valid first lien upon the Leasehold Interest and
Improvements subject only to such other liens and encumbrances approved by
Lender and shown in the Title Policy.

(h)  CROSS-DEFAULT.  The occurrence of any Event of Default under the
Deed of Trust.

7.02 ACCELERATION.  Upon the occurrence of a Default specified in Sections
7.01, Lender may, at its option, declare all sums owing to Lender under the
Note, the Original Note and the other Loan Documents immediately due and
payable.  Upon the occurrence of any Default specified in any of the Loan
Documents which provides that acceleration shall be automatic, all sums owing to
Lender under the Note, the Original Note and the other Loan Documents shall
automatically become immediately due and payable.  Upon acceleration, Lender
may, in addition to other uses permitted under the Loan Documents, apply
undisbursed Loan proceeds and any sums in the Account and the Borrower's Funds
Account to the sums owing to Lender under the Loan Documents in such order as
Lender may elect.  Without limitation of the provisions of Section 7.04 hereof,
Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney-in-
fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, to accomplish the foregoing
actions and rights of Lender or transfer of such funds to Lender.

7.03 DISBURSEMENT BY LENDER.  Upon the occurrence of a Default which is
occasioned by Borrower's failure to pay money, Lender may but shall not be
obligated to make such payment from Loan proceeds, Borrower's Funds, or other
funds of Lender.  If

<PAGE>

such payment is made from proceeds of the Loan or from Borrower's Funds,
Borrower shall deposit in the Borrower's Funds Account, upon written demand
issued pursuant to Section 3.01(b), an amount equal to such payment. If such
payment is made from funds of Lender, Borrower shall repay such funds upon
demand issued pursuant to Section 7.06. In either case, the Default with respect
to which any such payment has been made by Lender shall not be deemed cured
until such deposit or repayment (as the case may be) has been made by Borrower.

7.04 LENDER'S COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION.  If a Default occurs, Lender
may, upon five (5) days written notice to Borrower, and with or without legal
process, take possession of the Property and Improvements, remove Borrower and
all agents, employees and contractors of Borrower from the Property and
Improvements, complete the Work and market and sell or lease the Leasehold
Interest and the Improvements.  Borrower irrevocably appoints Lender as its
attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest for the purposes of
effecting the provisions of this Section 7.04.  As attorney-in-fact, Lender may,
in Borrower's name, take or omit to take any action Lender may deem appropriate,
including, without limitation, exercising Borrower's rights under the Loan
Documents and all contracts concerning the Property and/or Improvements.

7.05 CESSATION OF CONSTRUCTION.  If Lender reasonably determines that the
Work is not being performed in accordance with the Plans and Specifications, the
Requirements, or the Loan Documents, Lender may order all Work affected by the
condition of nonconformance immediately stopped.  After that order, Borrower
shall not allow any Work, other than corrective work, to be performed on any of
the Property or Improvements affected by the condition of nonconformance until
Lender notifies Borrower in writing that the nonconforming condition has been
corrected, which notice shall be provided by Lender promptly after completion of
the corrective work and receipt of notice from Borrower that such work has been
completed.

7.06 REPAYMENT OF FUNDS ADVANCED.  If Lender spends its funds in
exercising any of its rights or remedies under the Loan Documents, the amount of
funds spent shall be payable to Lender upon demand, together with interest at
the rate applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified therein
plus 2% per annum, from the date the funds were spent.  Until repaid, such
amounts shall have the security afforded disbursements under the Note.

7.07 RIGHT OF CONTEST.  Borrower may contest in good faith any claim,
demand, levy or assessment (other than liens and stop notices, provision for
which is made in Section 4.09) by any

<PAGE>

person other than Lender which would constitute a Default if (a) Borrower
pursues the contest diligently and in a manner which Lender determines is not
prejudicial to Lender and does not impair the rights of Lender under any of the
Loan Documents; and (b) Borrower deposits with Lender any funds or other forms
of assurance which Lender in good faith from time to time reasonably determines
appropriate to protect Lender from the consequences of the contest being
unsuccessful. Borrower's compliance with this Section shall operate to prevent
such claim, demand, levy or assessment from becoming a Default.


ARTICLE VIII.  HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

8.01 COVENANTS.  Without limitation of the provisions of the Ground Lease
or any other agreement, covenant or restriction by which Borrower may be bound,
Borrower hereby agrees as follows:

(a)  NO HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES.  Borrower shall not cause or knowingly
permit any Hazardous Materials to be brought onto the Property in violation of
applicable law.

(b)  HAZARDOUS MATERIALS LAWS.  Borrower shall comply and cause the
Property to comply with all Hazardous Materials Laws in connection with the
Work.

(c)  NOTICES.  Borrower shall immediately notify Lender in writing of:
(i) the discovery by Borrower of any breach or violation of the foregoing
clauses (a) and (b) of this Section, or (ii) the receipt by Borrower of written
notice of any Hazardous Materials Claims.

(d)  REMEDIAL ACTION.  Subject to applicable law, in response to
Borrower's actual knowledge of the presence of any Hazardous Materials on or
under the Property resulting from any breach or violation of the foregoing
clauses (a) and (b) of this Section, Borrower shall promptly commence and
thereafter diligently pursue, at no cost or expense to Lender, all Remedial
Action in connection with such Hazardous Materials.  The foregoing, however,
shall be subject to Borrower's right of contest under Section 8.02, below.

8.02 RIGHT OF CONTEST.  Borrower may contest in good faith any claim,
demand, levy or assessment under the Hazardous Materials Laws or any Hazardous
Materials Claims made by any person or entity if: (a) the contest is based on a
material question of law or fact raised by Borrower in good faith; (b) Borrower
promptly commences and thereafter diligently pursues the contest; (c) the
contest will not materially impair the taking of any Remedial Action with
respect to such claim, demand, levy or

<PAGE>

assessment under Hazardous Materials Laws or Hazardous Materials Claims; and (d)
Borrower demonstrates to Lender's reasonable satisfaction that Borrower has the
financial capability to undertake and pay for such contest and any Remedial
Action when reasonably necessary. No Default shall be deemed to exist with
respect to any claim, demand, levy or attachment being contested by Borrower in
accordance with the foregoing terms of this Section 8.02.

8.03 INDEMNITY.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Section 9.29, the duty of Borrower to indemnify Lender and the liability of
Borrower to Lender under Section 9.02 shall not be secured by the Deed of Trust
or subject to any "non-recourse" or "limitation of liability" provisions of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document if such duty to indemnify arises out of a
breach of Section 8.01 hereof.  Borrower acknowledges that Lender's appraisal of
the Leasehold Interest and Improvements is such that Lender is not willing to
accept the consequences under California's "One Form of Action Rule" (i.e.
Section 726 of the CCP) and "Anti-Deficiency Rules" (i.e. Sections 580(a),
580(b) and 580(d) of the CCP) of the inclusion of Borrower's duty to indemnify
Lender with respect to the matters described above in this Section 8.03 among
the obligations secured by the Deed of Trust and that Lender would not make the
Loan but for the unsecured personal liability undertaken by Borrower in
connection with such matters.  Borrower further acknowledges that Lender's right
to indemnification with respect to such matters is in addition to, and not in
limitation of, all of the rights and remedies which Lender may possess at law or
in equity at any time under any Hazardous Materials Laws.

8.04 INSPECTION BY LENDER.  Upon reasonable prior notice to Borrower,
Lender, its employees and agents, may from time to time (whether before or after
the commencement of a nonjudicial or judicial foreclosure proceeding) enter and
inspect the Property for the purpose of determining the existence, location,
nature and magnitude of any past or present release or threatened release of any
Hazardous Materials into, onto, beneath or from the Property.


ARTICLE IX.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS


9.01 EXPENSES.  Borrower shall pay Lender immediately upon demand all
costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the enforcement or

harmless from, any losses, damages, liabilities, claims, actions, judgments,

the Loan, except for violations of lending laws or regulations by Lender; or

Agreement or any of the Loan Documents; or (iii) any failure at any time of any
of Borrower's representations or warranties to be true and correct, or (iv) any

indemnity together with interest from the date the indebtedness arises until
paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of the Note as

survive the release and cancellation of the Note and the reconveyance or partial
reconveyance of the Deed of Trust.

other records for the Work, the Leasehold Interest and Improvements and for
disbursement and use of the Loan proceeds and Borrower's Funds, and during

9.04 ERISA COMPLIANCE.  Borrower shall at all times comply with the
provisions of ERISA with respect to any retirement or other employee benefit
plan to which it is a party as employer, and as soon as possible after Borrower
knows, or has reason to know, that any Reportable Event (as defined in ERISA)
with respect to any such plan of Borrower has occurred, it shall furnish to
Lender a statement in writing setting forth details as to such Reportable Event
and the action, if any, which Borrower proposes to take with respect thereto,
together with a copy of the notice of such Reportable Event furnished to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

9.05 FURTHER ASSURANCES.  At Lender's request and at Borrower's expense,

the purposes of the Loan Documents or to perfect and preserve any liens created
by the Loan Documents.

9.06 FORM OF DOCUMENTS.  The form and substance of all documents,
instruments, and forms of evidence to be delivered to Lender under the terms of

Borrower and their permitted successors and assigns shall have any right of
action under any of the Loan Documents.

given when received or, if earlier, in the case of delivery by courier service
with guaranteed next day delivery, the next day or the day designated for
delivery, or in the case of delivery by certified United States mail, two days
after deposit therein.  No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall of
itself entitle Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or
other circumstances.

borrower and lender.  Lender neither undertakes nor assumes any responsibility
or duty to Borrower or to any third party with respect to the Leasehold
Interest, Improvements or Loan, except as expressly provided in the Loan
Documents and the Ground Lease.

9.12 LENDER'S DELAY.  Lender shall not be liable in any way for Lender's
failure to perform or delay in performing under the Loan Documents, and Lender
may suspend or terminate all or any portion of Lender's obligations under the
Loan Documents if Lender's delay or failure results directly or indirectly from,
or is based upon, the action, inaction, or purported action, of any Governmental
Agency, or any other cause or event identified in Section 4.02 hereof.

9.13 ATTORNEY'S FEES; ENFORCEMENT.  If any attorney is engaged by Lender
to enforce, or defend any provision of any of the Loan documents, or as a
consequence of any Default under the Loan Documents, with or without the filing
of any legal action or proceeding, Borrower shall pay to Lender, immediately
upon demand, the amount of all attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Lender in
connection therewith, together with interest thereon from the date of such
demand until paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of
the Note as specified therein plus 2% per annum.

<PAGE>

9.14 ASSIGNMENT.  Borrower shall not assign Borrower's interest under any
of the Loan Documents, or in any monies due or to become due thereunder, without
Lender's prior written consent.  Any assignment made without Lender's consent
shall be void.  Borrower recognizes that this is not an ordinary loan and that
Lender would not make this Loan except in reliance on Borrower's expertise and
reputation, Lender's knowledge of Borrower, and Lender's understanding that this
Agreement is more in the nature of an agreement involving personal services than
a standard loan where Lender would rely on security upon which no additional
work is planned.  In this instance, Lender is relying on Borrower's expertise
and prior experience to perform and complete the Work in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents.

9.15 LENDER'S AGENTS.  Lender may designate an agent or independent
contractor to exercise any of Lender's rights under the Loan Documents.  Any
reference to Lender in any of the Loan Documents shall include Lender's agents,
employees or independent contractors.

9.16 SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of the Loan Documents shall be
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that portion shall be deemed severed from the Loan Documents and
the remaining parts shall remain in full force as though the invalid, illegal,
or unenforceable portion had never been part of the Loan Documents.

9.17 HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  The terms of the Loan Documents shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors and assigns of
the parties; provided however, that this Section does not waive the provisions
of Section 9.14.

9.18 RIGHTS CUMULATIVE, NO WAIVER.  All Lender's rights and remedies
provided in the Loan Documents, granted by law or otherwise, are cumulative and
may be exercised by Lender at any time.  Lender's exercise of any right or
remedy shall not constitute a cure of any Default unless all sums then due and
payable to Lender under the Loan Documents are repaid and Borrower has cured all
other Defaults.  No waiver shall be implied from any failure of Lender to take,
or any delay by Lender in taking, action concerning any Default or failure of
condition under the Loan Documents, or from any previous waiver of any similar
or unrelated Default or failure of condition.  Any waiver or approval under any
of the Loan Documents must be in writing and shall be limited to its specific
terms.

9.19 TIME.  Time is of the essence of each term of the Loan Documents.

<PAGE>

9.20 HEADINGS.  All headings appearing in any of the Loan Documents are
for convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing the Loan Documents.

9.21 GOVERNING LAW.  The Loan Documents shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, except to the
extent preempted by Federal laws.  Borrower and all persons and entities in any
manner obligated to Lender under the Loan Documents consent to the jurisdiction
of any Federal or State Court within the State of California having proper venue
and also consent to service of process by any means authorized by California or
Federal Law.

9.22 INTEGRATION; INTERPRETATION.  The Loan Documents contain or expressly
incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
matters contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations.  The Loan
Documents shall not be modified except by written instrument executed by all
parties.  Any reference in any of the Loan Documents to the Property, the
Leasehold Interest or Improvements shall include all or any part of the
Property, the Leasehold Interest or Improvements.  Any reference to the Loan
Documents in any of the Loan Documents includes any amendments, renewals or
extensions approved by Lender.  Any reference in this Agreement to the Loan
Documents shall include all or any of the provisions of this Agreement and the
Loan Documents unless otherwise specified.

9.23 JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY.  The liability of all persons and
entities who are in any manner obligated under any of the Loan Documents shall
be joint and several.

9.24 EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement, and other Loan Documents
which expressly so provide, may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which when executed and delivered will be deemed to be an original and all of
which, taken together, will be deemed to be one and the same instrument.

9.25 INCORPORATION.  Exhibits A and B attached hereto are incorporated
into this Agreement.

9.26 CREDIT FOR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS.  Any payment made upon the outstanding
principal balance of the Loan shall be credited as of the business day upon
which the applicable following condition has occurred by no later than 11:00
a.m. (Pacific Standard Time or Pacific Daylight Time, as appropriate):

(a)  In the case of a principal payment made by a federal funds wire
transfer, upon receipt by Lender of written advice from the Federal Reserve
System confirming that the transferred amount has been credited for the account
of Lender; or

<PAGE>

(b)  In the case of a principal payment made by either a cashier's
check, or in the case of a check drawn upon a deposit account in which there are
then sufficient funds on deposit for the payment of said check, upon receipt by
Lender of such check or cashier's check at the address designated elsewhere
herein for the delivery to Lender of notices.

9.27 WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION (a) ARISING UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE ORIGINAL NOTE,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE MODIFICATION THEREOF OR (b)
IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE
PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE ORIGINAL
NOTE (AS NOW OR HEREAFTER MODIFIED) OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR
AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE; AND EACH PARTY
HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF
ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH
ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER
OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

9.28 OBLIGATIONS UNDER GROUND LEASE.  Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed to relieve or excuse Borrower of any of its obligations in
its capacity as ground tenant under the Ground lease.

9.29 NONRECOURSE.

(a)  Borrower shall be liable upon the indebtedness evidenced by the
Note, for all sums to accrue or to become payable thereunder, and for
performance of any covenants contained in any of the Loan Documents to the
extent, but only the extent, of Lender's security for the same, including,
without limitation, all properties, rights, estates, and interests covered by
this Agreement and the Loan Documents.  No attachment, execution or other writ
of process shall be sought, issued or levied upon any assets, properties or
funds of Borrower other than the properties, rights, estates and interest
described in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  In the event of
foreclosure of such title, liens, mortgages or security interests, by private
power of sale or otherwise, no judgment for any deficiency upon such
indebtedness, sums and amounts shall be sought or obtained by Lender against
Borrower.

<PAGE>

(b)  Subject to the limitations set forth in Subparagraph (a) above,
nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent Lender from exercising
and enforcing any other remedy allowed at law or in equity or by any statute or
by the terms of any of the Loan Documents.

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Subparagraphs (a) and
(b) above, or any provision of the Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document to
the contrary, no limitation of liability set forth herein, in the Deed of Trust
or in any other Loan Documents shall be deemed to limit any right Lender might
otherwise have to obtain injunctive relief against Borrower or any partner of
Borrower related to the Leasehold Interest or the Improvements or any personal
property security or to take any action to preserve, enforce or foreclose the
liens, mortgages, assignments and security interests now or at any time
hereafter securing the payment and performance of all sums and obligations
hereunder or any of the Loan Documents, or to collect rents or to collect
amounts which may become owing or payable under or on account of insurance,
condemnation awards or damages for other public actions or surety bonds
maintained or provided by Borrower.

(d)  In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.29,
neither the limitation of liability set forth herein, or in the Deed of Trust or
any other Loan Document:

(i)  shall apply to any damages sustained by Lender by reason of:

(A)  any misrepresentation by Borrower or any partner of
Borrower proving to have been an intentional or fraudulent
misrepresentation when made,

(B)  waste or intentional damage to the Property or
Improvements thereon by Borrower or any partner of Borrower,

(C)  any breach of Borrower's obligations under Section 8.03
hereof,

(D)  the failure of Borrower or any partner of Borrower to
pay any income or other taxes, assessments or charges attributable to
the Borrower or such partner (as the case may be) which can create
liens on any portion of the Leasehold Interest or Improvements (to the
full extent of any such taxes, assessments or other charges) as to
Borrower or the partner who fails to pay such taxes, assessments or
charges, or

<PAGE>

(E)  the making of any payment or any distribution (cash,
profits, fees or otherwise) of any assets of Borrower to any partner
of Borrower or to any affiliate of a partner of Borrower without the
prior written consent of Lender; and

(ii) shall apply should Borrower, or any partner of Borrower,
claim or contend at any time that the Deed of Trust securing the Loan is,
for any reason, invalid or unenforceable to an extent that would:

(A)  preclude Lender from foreclosing the Deed of Trust or
causing a trustee's sale in connection with the Deed of Trust upon the
occurrence of a Default hereunder, or

(B)  preclude Lender from foreclosing or otherwise enforcing
its security interest in the personal property covered by the Deed of
Trust or the Security Agreement upon the occurrence of a Default
hereunder.

(e)  Nothing herein contained shall limit or be construed to limit the
personal liability and obligations of Borrower in the event that and to the
extent that after a Default or an event or circumstance that with the passage of
time, the giving of notice, or both, could constitute a Default, Borrower
collects any rents, issues or profits of the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements or derived from the Leasehold Interest or the Improvements and does
not apply the same to the normal operating expenses of the Leasehold Interest or
the Improvements or any payments due under any of the Loan Documents, it being
intended hereby that Borrower shall be personally liable and obligated hereunder
to the full extent of such rentals and other items so collected and not so
applied, and that Lender or other holder hereof or of the Note, the Original
Note or any of the Loan Documents shall not be limited in any way in enforcing
such personal liability and obligations of Borrower.

<PAGE>

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Borrower and Lender have executed this Agreement as of
the date appearing on the first page of this Agreement.

Maturity Date at the Interest Rate, in accordance with the terms hereof.
Interest payable hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year.

3.   Payments of Interest and Principal.

(a)  Time and Method of Payment.

(i)  If the Disbursement Date does not occur on the first day of
a month, there shall be paid on the first day of the first month following
the Disbursement Date, for the period commencing on the Disbursement Date
and ending on and including the last day of the month in which the
Disbursement Date occurs, interest only on the portion of the Principal Sum
disbursed on the Disbursement Date at the Interest Rate. Thereafter,
subject to Paragraph 3(a)(ii) below, Maker shall pay the Principal Sum to
Lender, together with interest thereon calculated in arrears, in monthly
installments commencing on the first day of the second month following the
Disbursement Date and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter
until the Maturity Date. Each installment shall be in an amount sufficient

year

<PAGE>

amortization schedule at the Interest Rate, which schedule shall be deemed
to have commenced on the first day of the first month following the
Disbursement Date regardless of the date of any subsequent disbursement of
the Principal Sum by Lender under the Loan Agreement. Lender shall
recalculate the amount of such monthly installments after each disbursement
of the Principal Sum under the Loan Agreement.

(ii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 3(a)(i) above,
until January 1, 1996 Maker shall be required to make monthly installments
of interest and principal due to Lender only from and to the extent of Net
Operating Cash Flow realized by Maker for any month ending prior to January
1, 1996. Each such monthly installment (or portion thereof) of interest and
principal which is not paid by Maker when due in accordance with the
foregoing sentence shall accrue interest at the Interest Rate from the date
the same was due. The total of all such unpaid monthly installments (or
portions thereof), together with all interest accruals thereon, shall be
referred to herein as the "Accrued Amount." The Accrued Amount, or any
portion thereof remaining unpaid at any time and from time to time during
the term of this Note (the "Accrual Balance") shall bear interest at the
Interest Rate until fully repaid by Maker to Lender. At any time and from
time to time up to the Maturity Date, Maker may pay the then outstanding
Accrual Balance to Lender, in whole or in part. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Maker hereby agrees to apply all Net Operating Cash Flow
realized by Maker for any month during the term of this Note (in excess of
the amount required to be paid pursuant to the first sentence of this
Paragraph 3(a)(ii)) (A) to reduce the outstanding Accrual Balance until
paid in full, and (B) after the outstanding Accrual Balance has been paid
in full, to reduce the outstanding Principal Sum. In all events, the
Principal Sum, including any Accrual Balance, remaining unpaid on the
Maturity Date shall be paid to Lender in full on the Maturity Date.

(iii)  Net Operating Cash Flow.  For purposes of this Note, the
term "Net Operating Cash Flow" shall mean, as to any particular Fiscal Year
or portion thereof, the difference between (i) the aggregate of all fixed,
minimum and guaranteed rents, fees, overage rents, percentage or
participation rents and all rents and receipts from licenses and
concessions received from the Property, including all amounts received for
parking and all fees, income and revenue of a non-rental nature received by
Maker during such Fiscal

<PAGE>

Year, less (ii) Operating Expenses, capital expenditures and reserves
therefor (to the extent permitted by Lender under the Loan Agreement), cost
of tenant improvements, payments of principal, interest, loan fees or other
charges or amounts on the Original Note which are paid by Maker during such
Fiscal Year, all payments by Maker to Lender under the Ground Lease, and a
reasonable reserve as determined by Maker to cover such expenses in the
following Fiscal Year, all as determined on a cash accounting basis. Net
Operating Cash Flow shall be computed by Maker on a monthly basis.

(iv)  Definition of Operating Expenses.  "Operating Expenses"
shall mean all reasonable and necessary charges and expenses actually
incurred by Maker for the maintenance, protection, management and operation
of the Property in the manner required by the Ground Lease and consistent
with the management and operation of like properties in the Greater San
Francisco area, and shall include, but not be limited to:

(A)  normal, prevailing wages, salaries, and fringe benefits
and payroll taxes for on-site personnel engaged in the operation of
the Property (excluding home office personnel);

(B)  a management fee not in excess of the "Maximum
Management Fee", if, in fact, such fee is incurred, plus the actual
cost of on-site management. The "Maximum Management Fee" shall be
three percent (3%) of gross collected revenue;

(C)  payment of utilities, maintenance supplies, real estate
taxes, betterments and assessments (but not income taxes or interest
paid on taxes), cleaning, repairs, insurance, ordinary accounting,
auditing and legal fees, interest paid to others on funds held in
escrow, ordinary advertising;

(D)  normal, prevailing brokerage commissions payable to
third parties; and

(E)  expenses incurred for replacement of capital
improvements and reserves therefor (to the extent permitted by Lender
under the Loan Agreement).

"Operating Expenses" shall not include depreciation or any other non-
cash costs.
<PAGE>

(b)  Maturity Date.  On the Maturity Date, Maker shall pay to Lender
the entire then unpaid and outstanding Principal Sum, together with any accrued,
unpaid interest hereunder (including, without limitation any outstanding Accrual
Balance).

4.   Books and Records, Reports and Audits.  During the term of this Note,
Maker shall maintain books and records and cause reports and audits to be
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Deed of Trust.

5.   Additional Interest.  All expenditures by Lender pursuant to this Note
or the other Loan Documents which are not reimbursed by Maker immediately upon
demand, all amounts remaining due and unpaid after the Maturity Date and any
amounts due and unpaid after an Event of Default shall bear interest at the rate
of five percent (5%) per annum more than the Interest Rate, until such amounts
are paid to Lender.

6.   Manner and Place of Payment.  All payments hereunder shall be made in
lawful money of the United States of America, in immediately available funds, at
399 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, c/o Copley Real Estate
Advisors, Inc., or at such other place as Lender may from time to time designate
in writing.

7.   Application of Payments.  Unless an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, all payments hereunder shall be applied first to costs of
collection or enforcement and other similar amounts due, if any, under this Note
and the other Loan Documents, then to any accrued, unpaid interest due under the
Note (including, without limitation, any outstanding interest included in the
Accrual Balance), and then to the outstanding Principal Sum (including any
portion of the Principal Sum included in the Accrual Balance). If an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, such payments may be applied to sums due
hereunder or under the Loan Documents in any order and combination that Lender
may, in its sole discretion, determine.

8.   Waivers.  Other than as expressly provided herein with respect to
notice and cure rights, Maker waives presentment for payment, demand, notice of
nonpayment, notice of intention to accelerate the maturity of this Note,
diligence in collection, commencement of suit against any obligor, notice of
protest, and protest of this Note and all other notices in connection with the
delivery, acceptance, performance, default or enforcement of the payment of this
Note, before or after maturity of this Note, with or without notice to Maker,
and agrees that its liability shall

<PAGE>

not be in any manner affected by any indulgence, extension of time, renewal,
waiver or modification granted or consented to by Lender. Maker consents to any
and all extensions of time, renewals, waivers or modifications that may be
granted by Lender with respect to the payment or other provisions of this Note,
and to any substitution, exchange or release of the collateral for this Note, or
any part thereof, with or without substitution of said collateral.

9.   No Usury.  Lender and Maker intend to comply at all times with
applicable usury laws. If at any time such laws would ever render usurious any
amounts called for under this Note or the other Loan Documents, then it is
Maker's and Lender's express intention that Maker shall not be required to pay
interest on this Note at a rate in excess of the maximum lawful rate, that the
provisions of this Paragraph shall control over all other provisions or this
Note and the Loan Documents which may be in apparent conflict hereunder, that
such excess amount shall be immediately credited on the principal balance of
this Note (or, if this Note has been fully paid, refunded by Lender to Maker),
and the provisions hereof shall be immediately reformed and the amounts
thereafter collectible under this Note reduced, without the necessity of the
execution of any further documents, so as to comply with applicable usury laws,
but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for
under this Note. Any such crediting or refund shall not cure or waive any
default by Maker under this Note or the other Loan Documents. If at any time
following any reduction in the interest rate payable by Maker there remains
unpaid any principal amount under this Note and the maximum interest rate not
prohibited by applicable law is increased or eliminated, then the interest rate
payable under this Note shall be readjusted, to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, so that the total dollar amount of interest payable hereunder
shall be equal to the dollar amount of interest which would have been paid by
Maker without giving effect to the reduction in interest resulting from
compliance with applicable usury laws. Maker agrees that in determining whether
or not any interest payable under this Note or the other Loan Documents exceeds
the highest rate not prohibited by law, any non-principal payment (except
payments specifically stated in this Note or in the other Loan Documents to be
"interest"), shall, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, be an expense,
fee, or premium rather than interest. The term "applicable law" as used in this
Note shall mean the laws of the State of California, or the laws of the United
States, whichever laws allow the greater rate of interest, as such laws now
exist or may be changed or amended or come into effect in the future.

<PAGE>

10.  Remedies.  The rights and remedies of Lender are set forth in the Loan
Documents and include, without limitation, in case of an Event of Default, the
right to declare the outstanding Principal Sum and any accrued and unpaid
interest due under this Note (including, without limitation, any outstanding
Accrual Balance) immediately due and payable.

11.  Amendments.  This Note may not be changed or amended orally but only
by an agreement in writing, signed by the party against whom enforcement is
sought.

12.  Governing Law.  This Note shall be governed and construed by the laws
of the State of California.

13.  Permitted Prepayment.  Maker may prepay the entire unpaid Principal
Sum, with accrued and unpaid interest (including, without limitation, any
outstanding Accrual Balance), in whole or in part, at any time, without
prepayment penalty. Unless Lender otherwise agrees, the amount of the monthly
installments of principal and interest payable hereunder shall not be reduced in
the event of any partial prepayment.

14.  Non-Recourse Debt.

(a)  Maker shall be liable upon the indebtedness evidenced by this
Note, for all sums to accrue or to become payable thereunder, and for
performance of any covenants contained in any of the Loan Documents to the
extent, but only the extent, of Lender's security for the same, including,
without limitation, all properties, rights, estates, and interests covered by
the Loan Agreement and the Loan Documents. No attachment, execution or other
writ of process shall be sought, issued or levied upon any assets, properties or
funds of Maker other than the properties, rights, estates and interest described
in Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In the event of foreclosure of
such title, liens, mortgages or security interests, by private power of sale or
otherwise, no judgment for any deficiency upon such indebtedness, sums and
amounts shall be sought or obtained by Lender against Maker.

(b)  Subject to the limitations set forth in Subparagraph (a) above,

by the terms of any of the Loan Documents.

<PAGE>

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Subparagraphs (a) and
(b) above, or of any provision of the Deed of Trust or any other Loan Document
to the contrary, no limitation of liability set forth herein, in the Deed of
Trust or in any other Loan Document shall be deemed to limit any right Lender
might otherwise have to obtain injunctive relief against Maker or any partner of
Maker related to the Leasehold Interest or the Improvements or any personal
property security or to take any action to preserve, enforce or foreclose the
liens, mortgages, assignments and security interests now or at any time
hereafter securing the payment and performance of all sums and obligations
hereunder or any of the Loan Documents, or to collect rents or to collect
amounts which may become owing or payable under or on account of insurance,
condemnation awards or damages for other public actions or surety bonds
maintained or provided by Maker.

(d)  In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 14,
neither the limitation of liability set forth herein, or in the Deed of Trust or

(i)  shall apply to any damages sustained by Lender by reason of:

(A)  any misrepresentation by Maker or any partner of Maker
proving to have been an intentional or fraudulent misrepresentation
when made,

(B)  waste or intentional damage to the Property or
Improvements thereon by Maker or any partner of Maker,

(C)  any breach of Maker's obligations under Section 8.03 of
the Loan Agreement,

(D)  the failure of Maker or any partner of Maker to pay any
income or other taxes, assessments or charges attributable to the
Maker or such partner (as the case may be) which can create liens on
any portion of the Leasehold Interest or Improvements (to the full
extent of any such taxes, assessments or other charges) as to Maker or
the partner who fails to pay such taxes, assessments or charges, or

(E)  the making of any payment or any distribution (cash,
profits, fees or otherwise) of any assets of Maker to any partner of
Maker or to any

<PAGE>

affiliate of a partner of Maker without the prior written consent of
Lender; and

(ii)  shall apply should Maker, or any partner of Maker, claim or
contend at any time that the Deed of Trust securing the Loan is, for any
reason, invalid or unenforceable to an extent that would:

(A)  preclude Lender from foreclosing the Deed of Trust or
causing a trustee's sale in connection with the Deed of Trust upon the
occurrence of a Default under the Loan Agreement, or

(B)  preclude Lender from foreclosing or otherwise enforcing its
security interest in the personal property covered by the Deed of Trust or
the Security Agreement upon the occurrence of a Default under the Loan
Agreement.

(e)  Nothing herein contained shall limit or be construed to limit the
personal liability and obligations of Maker in the event that and to the extent
that after a Default or an event or circumstance that with the passage of time,
the giving of notice, or both, could constitute a Default, Maker collects any
rents, issues or profits of the Leasehold Interest or the Improvements or
derived from the Leasehold Interest or the Improvements and does not apply the
same to the normal operating expenses of the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements or any payments due under any of the Loan Documents, it being
intended hereby that Maker shall be personally liable and obligated hereunder to
the full extent of such rentals and other items so collected and not so applied,
and that Lender or other holder hereof or of this Note, the Original Note or any
of the Loan Documents shall not be limited in any way in enforcing such personal
liability and obligations of Maker.

15.  Security.  This Note is secured, in part, by the Deed of Trust, the
Assignment of Leases, the Security Agreement and all amendments, modifications,
supplements, substitutions, additions, renewals, replacements and extensions
thereof.

16.  Collection.  Any check, draft, money order or other instrument given
in payment of all or any portion hereof may be accepted by Lender and handled by
collection in the customary manner, but the same shall not constitute payment
hereunder or diminish any rights of Lender except to the extent that actual

<PAGE>

cash proceeds of such instrument are unconditionally received by Lender and
applied to this indebtedness in the manner elsewhere herein provided.

17.  Attorneys' Fees.  Upon any Event of Default, Maker shall pay all costs
of collection, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, whether or not suit is filed hereon.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Note has been executed and delivered of the 1st
day of January, 1995.

otherwise enforcing its security interest in the personal
property covered by this Indenture or the Security Agreement

construed to limit the personal liability and obligations of
Trustor in the event that and to the extent that after an
Event of Default or an event or circumstance that with the
passage of time, the giving of notice, or both, could
constitute an Event of Default, Trustor collects any rents,
issues or profits of the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements or derived from the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements and does not apply the same to the normal
operating expenses of the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements or any payments due under any of the Loan
Documents, it being intended hereby that Trustor shall be

(f)  Paragraph 7.14 of the Lease Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety and the following new Paragraph 7.14 is hereby inserted
in place thereof:

"Non-Recourse Debt.

(a) Assignor shall be liable upon the indebtedness
evidenced by the Notes, for all sums to accrue or to become
payable thereunder, and for performance of any covenants
contained in any of the Loan Documents to the extent, but
only the extent, of Assignee's security for the same,
including, without limitation, all properties, rights,
estates, and interests covered by this Lease Assignment and
the Loan Documents. No attachment, execution or other writ
of process shall be sought, issued or levied upon any
assets, properties or funds of other than the properties,
rights, estates and interest described in this Lease
Assignment and the other Loan Documents. In the event of
foreclosure of such title, liens, mortgages or security
interests, by private power of sale or otherwise, no
judgment for any deficiency upon such indebtedness, sums and
amounts shall be sought or obtained by Assignee against
Assignor.

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in
Subparagraph (a) above, nothing herein contained shall be
construed to prevent Assignee from exercising and enforcing
any other remedy allowed at law or in equity or by

<PAGE>

any statute or by the terms of any of the Loan Documents.

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
Subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, or of any provision of this
Lease Assignment or any other Loan Document to the contrary,
no limitation of liability set forth herein, in the
Indenture or in any other Loan Document shall be deemed to
limit any right Assignee might otherwise have to obtain
injunctive relief against Assignor or any partner of
Assignor related to the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements or any personal property security or to take
any action to preserve, enforce or foreclose the liens,
mortgages, assignments and security interests now or at any
time hereafter securing the payment and performance of all
sums and obligations hereunder or any of the Loan Documents,
or to collect rents or to collect amounts which may become
owing or payable under or on account of insurance,
condemnation awards or damages for other public actions or
surety bonds maintained or provided by Assignor.

(d)  In addition to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.14, neither the limitation of liability set forth
herein, or in the Indenture or any other Loan Document:

(i)  shall apply to any damages sustained by Assignee
by reason of:

(A)  any misrepresentation by Assignor or any
partner of Assignor proving to have been an intentional or
fraudulent misrepresentation when made,

(B)  waste or intentional damage to the Property
or Improvements thereon by Assignor or any partner of
Assignor,

(C)  any breach of Assignor's obligations under
Section 8.03 of the Loan Agreement,

(D)  the failure of Assignor or any partner of
Assignor to pay any income or other taxes, assessments or
charges attributable to

<PAGE>

the Assignor or such partner (as the case may be) which can
create liens on any portion of the Leasehold Interest or
Improvements (to the full extent of any such taxes,
assessments or other charges) as to Assignor or the partner
who fails to pay such taxes, assessments or charges, or

(E)  the making of any payment or any distribution
(cash, profits, fees or otherwise) of any assets of Assignor
to any partner of Assignor or to any affiliate of a partner
of Assignor without the prior written consent of Assignee;
and

(ii) shall apply should Assignor, or any partner of
Assignor, claim or contend at any time that the Indenture
securing the Loan is, for any reason, invalid or
unenforceable to an extent that would:

(A)  preclude Assignee from foreclosing the
Indenture or causing a trustee's sale in connection with the
Indenture upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under
the Indenture, or

(B)  preclude Assignee from foreclosing or
otherwise enforcing its security interest in the personal
property covered by the Indenture or the Security Agreement
upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the
Indenture.

(e)  Nothing herein contained shall limit or be
construed to limit the personal liability and obligations of
Assignor in the event that and to the extent that after an
Event of Default or an event or circumstance that with the
passage of time, the giving of notice, or both, could
constitute an Event of Default, Assignor collects any rents,
issues or profits of the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements or derived from the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements and does not apply the same to the normal
operating expenses of the Leasehold Interest or the
Improvements or any payments due under any of the Loan
Documents, it being intended hereby that Assignor shall be
personally liable and

<PAGE>

obligated hereunder to the full extent of such rentals and
other items so collected and not so applied, and that
Assignee or other holder hereof or of either of the Notes or
any of the Loan Documents shall not be limited in any way in
enforcing such personal liability and obligations of
Assignor."


3.   Affirmation of Lien; Full Force and Effect.  Except as amended by this
Amendment, the Indenture and the Lease Assignment shall remain unmodified and in
full force and effect.  The parties hereto hereby ratify and confirm the
Indenture and the Lease Assignment, as amended herein.  Without limitation of
the foregoing, Trustor hereby certifies that (i) the representations and
warranties of Trustor set forth in Section 3 of the Indenture and Paragraph 3 of
the Lease Assignment are true, correct and complete in all material respects on
and as of the date hereof as though made on and as of the date hereof; and (ii)
Trustor has performed and complied with, in all material respects, all
agreements, covenants and obligations required to be performed by Trustor under
the Indenture and the Lease Assignment prior to the date hereof.

4.   References to Indenture and Lease Assignment.  All references to the
Indenture and the Lease Assignment in the Loan Documents shall be deemed to
refer to the Indenture and the Lease Assignment, respectively, as amended by
this Amendment.

5.   Counterparts.  This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

6.   Governing Law.  This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California.

7.   Conflict.  In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions
of this Amendment and the provisions of the Indenture and/or the Lease
Assignment, as applicable, the provisions of this Amendment shall govern and
prevail.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Trustor and Beneficiary have executed this Amendment as
of the date first above written.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND COMPLETELY
RESTATED GROUND LEASE


This First Amendment to Amended and Completely Restated Ground Lease (this
"Amendment") is made and entered into as of the 1st day of January, 1995, by and
between NEW ENGLAND LIFE PENSION PROPERTIES; A REAL ESTATE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,
NEW ENGLAND LIFE PENSION PROPERTIES II; A REAL ESTATE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
(jointly, the "Landlord"), whose address is c/o Copley Real Estate Advisors,
Inc., 399 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02116, and WILLOWS CONCORD VENTURE, a
California limited partnership (the "Tenant"), whose address is 18802 Bardeen
Avenue, Irvine California 92715-1521, who, for and in consideration of the sum
of Ten Dollars ($10.00) each to the other paid, and the mutual covenants flowing
between the parties hereto, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, do hereby covenant, warrant and agree as follows:

1.  Recitals.  This Amendment is made with reference to the following
facts and objectives:

a.   Landlord and Tenant entered into a certain written Amended and
Completely Restated Ground Lease dated as of June 18, 1991 (the "Lease"),
pursuant to which Landlord leased to Tenant and Tenant leased from Landlord,
certain premises more particularly described therein (the "Premises").

b.   The parties hereto desire to amend the Lease on the effective date
hereof on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

2.   Representations.  As an inducement to Landlord to enter into this
Amendment, Tenant represents that (a) Tenant has not made any assignment,
sublease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of said lease or any
interest thereof; and that there exists no claim, demand, obligation, liability,
action or cause of action arising from said Lease; and (b) there are no liens
for past due taxes of any nature (except any lien for unpaid city, state and
county 1995 ad valorem taxes on said Premises), paving, sidewalk, curbing,
sewer, or any other street improvements of any kind against or affecting said
Premises.

3.   Amendment of Lease.

a.   Sections 16.08(b), 16.08(c) and 16.09 are hereby deleted in their entirety
from the Amended Lease, and the following new section 16.08(b) is hereby
substituted in their place:
<PAGE>

"16.08(b) On or after January 1, 1996, Landlord may at its sole discretion
offer the entire Property (Landlord's Estate together with Tenant's Estate)
for sale for such price and on such other terms and conditions as the
Landlord may determine in its sole discretion. In connection with any such
sale or proposed sale, the Landlord shall have the right to cause the
Property to be marketed to such prospective purchasers and upon such terms
as the Landlord shall determine in its sole discretion and to take such
other actions as it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with such
sale or proposed sale. The Tenant agrees, at the direction of the Landlord,
to execute and deliver such documents, including without limitation
purchase and sale agreements, deeds or assignments of lease, as may be
reasonably required in connection with any such sale or proposed sale;
provided, however, that Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such documents to provide that the partners of Tenant will have no
recourse liability pursuant to such documents."

b.   Section 16.10 of the Amended Lease is hereby amended by adding the
following language at the end thereof:

"Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or
delay its consent to any (i) distribution to any general or limited partner
of Tenant of such partner's respective interest therein or (ii) assignment
or transfer by any general or limited partner of Tenant of its respective
interest so distributed to any person or entity controlling, controlled by,
or under common control with such general or limited partner (each an
"Affiliate"), provided that (A) such distribution, assignment or transfer
is made for the purpose of accomplishing a tax free exchange under Section
1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and (B) any and all
such Affiliates agree to assume all of the liabilities and obligations of
Tenant and such general or limited partner to Landlord pursuant to a
written instrument satisfactory to Landlord."

4.   Effective Date.  The effective date of this Amendment shall be the
date first above written.

5.   Successors.  This Amendment shall be binding on and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their heirs, successors and assigns.

<PAGE>

6.   No Other Modification.  Except as specifically amended by this
Amendment, no other provision of the Lease is hereby modified, and the Lease
shall remain in full force and effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Amended as a
sealed instrument on the date first above written.

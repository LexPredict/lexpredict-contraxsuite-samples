NOTE 1.    GENERAL

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The audited 1995 annual report of Lundgren Bros. Construction, Inc. and
Subsidiaries (the Company), filed in its 1995 Form 10-K, contains a summary of
significant accounting policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The same accounting policies are followed in the preparation of the
interim financial statements.

PER SHARE AMOUNTS

Per share amounts are computed by dividing by the weighted average number of
shares of voting and nonvoting common stock outstanding during each period. The
number of outstanding shares of common stock for the three months ended March
31, 1996 and 1995 was 10,625.


BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND INTERIM PERIODS

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information
and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by
generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. The
interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a fiscal year
as a whole.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF NONCASH TRANSACTIONS

The Company acquired developed lots and land for future development under
promissory notes with the sellers aggregating $1,238 and $512 during the three
months ended March 31,1996 and 1995, respectively.


NOTE 3.    SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company operates principally in two business segments as follows:

*        The new homes division, engaged in the interrelated activities of land
acquisition and development and the design, construction, painting,
staining and sale of detached single family homes.

*        The remodeling division, engaged in the activities of designing and
construction of residential remodeling projects. These projects include
complete house renovations, kitchen remodelings, bathroom remodelings,
second story additions, finished basements, enclosed porches and patios
and other miscellaneous projects.

The following is a summary of the financial information relating to the
Company's two business segments. A substantial amount of cost allocations are
necessary to determine the operating income (loss) by segment. For this reason,
and because the Company is an integrated enterprise, management does not
represent that these segments, if operated as independent businesses, would
result in the operating income (loss) amounts shown. Intersegment sales are not
significant.

NOTE 4.    LAND OPTION AND EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS

The Company has entered into option and purchase agreements to acquire lots in
residential housing developments and land for future development. On exercise of
an option, option payments are generally applied to the purchase price of land
acquired in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Earnest money deposits
are to be credited against future purchases. The Company had land purchase
commitments totaling approximately $5,354 and $3,069 at March 31, 1996 and
December 31, 1995, respectively, related to the earnest money deposits.



ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company is organized in two business segments: new homes and remodeling. New
homes segment includes land acquisition and development, home building and home
sales and painting and staining services. Remodeling consists of home remodeling
design and construction services.

NEW HOMES

Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 1996 decreased $316,000 or 3.1%
from the same period in 1995. The Company closed on sales of 27 homes in the
first three months of 1996 as compared to 30 closings in the same period in
1995, and the average selling price of homes closed in the first three months of
1996 increased by 7.7% from the average selling price of homes closed in the
same period in 1995. The Company believes that the decrease in homes closed was
due to the timing of the removal of customer purchase contingencies and
subsequent house starts in 1996 compared to 1995. The increase in average
selling price is due to changes in the mix of homes closed in the first three
months of 1996 compared to the same period in 1995.

Gross profit for the new homes segment for the three months ended March 31, 1996
was $1.6 million, an increase from $1.5 million in the same period in 1995. The
Company's gross profit margin in the three months ended March 31, 1996 increased
to 16.0% as compared to 14.8% in the same period in 1995. The Company believes
that this increase in gross profit margin is due to changes in the location of
the home developments and increase in the mix of homes sold on land developed by
the Company versus lots purchased from other developers.

Operating expenses for the new homes segment (which include selling, general and
administrative expenses) for the three months ended March 31, 1996 were
approximately the same as in 1995. As a percentage of total new home revenues,
these expenses increased to 13.7% in 1996 as compared to 13.3% in 1995, as most
are fixed in nature.

REMODELING

Operating loss for the remodeling segment for the three months ended March 31,
1996 decreased to $110,000 from $136,000 in the same period in 1995. This
decrease is due to improved cost controls in 1996.


OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET

Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 1996 increased $129,000 or
39.6% from the same period in 1995. This increase is mainly due to higher
interest rates and increased borrowings for additional developed land
inventories in 1996. Other income (expense), net increased $114,000 in the three
months ended March 31, 1996 from the same period in 1995. The increase is mainly
due to a gain on the sale of an investment in a land development partnership.

NET INCOME (LOSS)

Net loss in the three months ended March 31, 1996 was $119,000, a decrease of
$711,000 from $592,000 of net income in the same period in 1995. This decrease
is mainly due to the 1995 change in accounting for land acquisition and
development costs of $763,000 and increased interest expense of $129,000 which
is partially offset by a gain on the sale of an investment in a land development
partnership and improved operating income from new home sales.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows used in operating activities were $2.7 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1996, a decrease of approximately $3.2 million from the same
period in 1995, during which operating activities used $5.9 million of cash. The
decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $4.8 million, relative to 1995, in
the amount of cash used to reduce accounts payable and increase prepaid expenses
for land acquisition projects. These decreased cash uses are partially offset by
an increase of $1.3 million, relative to 1995, of cash used for inventory.

Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by approximately $116,000 from
$187,000 for the three months ended March 31, 1995 to $71,000 for the same
period in 1996. The decrease was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of an
investment in a land development partnership and a reduction of expenditures for
property and equipment, which were partially offset by an increase in cash
surrender value of life insurance.

Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased approximately $4.2 million
to $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 1996 from $5.5 million in
the same period in 1995. The decrease was primarily due to decreased net
borrowings on the Company's bank lines of credit primarily due to the decrease,
relative to 1995, in cash used in operating activities.


Financing

The Company believes that internally generated funds, amounts available under
its two lines of credit and borrowing arrangements entered into in the ordinary
course of business will continue to be the primary sources of capital for
liquidity. However, the Company may seek additional long-term financing.

The Company's financing needs depend primarily upon sales volume, asset
turnover, land acquisition and inventory balances. The Company presently
finances substantially all of its land acquisition and development and home
construction activities through borrowing arrangements for individual projects
or homes under construction. The borrowing arrangements evolve with each stage
of the process from land acquisition, to development, to construction of a home
and sale of the home and lot.

The Company also utilizes secured lines of credit to finance its operations. The
Company has approved aggregate credit of $6.5 million. At March 31, 1996, the
aggregate maximum credit available under the lines of credit was $6.1 million,
of which $3.7 million was utilized and $2.4 million was available.

The Company's outstanding indebtedness as of March 31, 1996 included $17.5
million due within one year. The Company has historically operated with a
substantial amount of its outstanding indebtedness due within one year and has
historically paid such debt out of earnings or through refinancing, where
applicable. The Company believes that the amounts available under its credit and
amounts generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its debt
obligations due in the next year. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to continue to obtain adequate short-term financing,
including bank financing, in the future.

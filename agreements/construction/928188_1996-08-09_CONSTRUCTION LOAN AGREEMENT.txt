2  THE CONSTRUCTION LOAN.

2.1. AGREEMENT TO MAKE CONSTRUCTION ADVANCES. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Loan Agreement, the Bank agrees to advance to the
Borrower on each Construction Loan Advance Date, upon notice by the Borrower to
the Bank given in accordance with (S)2.6 hereof, an amount equal to the
Construction Advance requested in such notice, provided that (i) the amount
requested shall not exceed the amount required to be paid at such time in
accordance with the payment terms of the Contract and (ii) the sum of the
Outstanding amount of all Construction Advances made by the Bank to the Borrower
pursuant to this (S)2.1 (after giving effect to all amounts requested) shall not
at any time exceed the Total Commitment and, provided further, the
<PAGE>

14

proceeds of such Construction Advance shall be used to finance the Project Costs
incurred as of such Construction Loan Advance Date in accordance with the
Contract. The aggregate principal amount requested pursuant to (S)2.6 hereof to
be advanced by the Bank to the Borrower on any given Construction Loan Advance
Date is referred to herein, in each instance, as a "Construction Advance", and
the aggregate cumulative principal amount of all sums advanced by the Bank to
the Borrower from time to time pursuant to this (S)2.1 is referred to herein as
the "Construction Loan". Each request for a Construction Advance hereunder shall
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the conditions set
forth in (S)10 and (S)11 hereof, in the case of the initial Construction Advance
to be made on the Closing Date, and (S)11 hereof, in the case of all other
Construction Advances, have been satisfied on the date of such request.

2.2. COMMITMENT FEE. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank a commitment
fee calculated at the rate of one-half of one percent (1/2%) per annum on the
average daily amount during each calendar quarter or portion thereof from the
Closing Date to the Maturity Date by which the Total Commitment exceeds the
Outstanding amount of the Construction Loan during such calendar quarter. The
commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each
calendar quarter for the immediately preceding calendar quarter commencing on
the first such date following the date hereof, with a final payment on the
Maturity Date or any earlier date on which the Commitment shall terminate.

2.3. REDUCTION OF TOTAL COMMITMENT. The Borrower shall have the right at
any time and from time to time upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice
to the Bank to reduce by $500,000 or an integral multiple thereof or terminate
entirely the unborrowed portion of the Total Commitment, whereupon the Total
Commitment shall be reduced by the amount specified in such notice or, as the
case may be, terminated. In the case of a reduction of the Total Commitment, the
amount of each remaining Construction Advance shall be reduced pro rata as a
result of such reduction of the Total Commitment. Upon the effective date of any
such reduction or termination, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank the full
amount of any commitment fee then accrued on the amount of the reduction. No
reduction of the Total Commitment may be reinstated.

2.4. THE NOTE. The Construction Loan shall be evidenced by a promissory
note of the Borrower, substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto
(the "Note"), dated as of the Closing Date and completed with appropriate
insertions. The Note shall be payable to the order of the Bank in a principal
amount equal to the Total Commitment or, if less, the Outstanding amount of all
Construction Advances made by the Bank, plus interest accrued thereon, as set
forth below. The Borrower irrevocably authorizes the Bank to make or cause to be
made, at or about the time of the Drawdown Date of any
<PAGE>

15

Construction Advance or at the time of receipt of any payment of principal on
the Note, an appropriate notation on the Note Record reflecting the making of
such Construction Advance or (as the case may be) the receipt of such payment.
The Outstanding amount of the Construction Advances set forth on the Note Record
shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount thereof owing and unpaid
to the Bank, but the failure to record, or any error in so recording, any such
amount on the Note Record shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of
the Borrower hereunder or under the Note to make payments of principal of or
interest on the Note when due.

2.5. INTEREST ON CONSTRUCTION ADVANCES. Except as otherwise provided in
(S)4.10,

(a)  Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest for the period
commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of the
Interest Period with respect thereto at the rate per annum equal to the
Base Rate plus one-quarter percent ( 1/4%).

(b)  Each Eurodollar Rate Advance shall bear interest for the period
commencing with the Drawdown Date thereof and ending on the last day of the
Interest Period with respect thereto at the rate per annum equal to the
Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus two and one-quarter percent
(2  1/4%).

(c)  The Borrower promises to pay interest on each Construction
Advance in arrears on each Interest Payment Date with respect thereto.

2.6. REQUESTS FOR CONSTRUCTION ADVANCES. The Borrower shall give to the
Bank written notice in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto (or telephonic
notice confirmed in a writing in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto) of each
Construction Advance requested hereunder (a "Construction Advance Request") no
less than (a) two (2) Business Days prior to any Drawdown Date of any Base Rate
Advance or (b) three (3) Eurodollar Business Days prior to any Drawdown Date of
any Eurodollar Rate Advance. Each such notice shall specify (i) the principal
amount of the Construction Advance; (ii) the amount of the Project Costs to be
funded by the requested Construction Advance (with reference to the Builder's,
subcontractor's or supplier's invoices relating to such Project Costs and/or
other supporting documentation, a copy of which shall have been delivered to the
Bank prior to or together with the Construction Advance Request); (iii) the
aggregate principal amount of the Construction Loan outstanding after giving
effect to the Construction Advance requested; (iv) the Interest Period for such
Construction Advance; and (v) the Type of such Construction Advance. Each such
notice shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower and shall obligate the
Borrower to accept from the Bank on the applicable Construction Loan Advance
Date the requested Construction Advance provided in such notice. The amount of
each Base Rate
<PAGE>

16

Advance requested pursuant to each Construction Advance Request shall be in a
minimum aggregate amount of $50,000. The amount of each Eurodollar Rate Advance
requested pursuant to each Construction Advance Request shall be in a minimum
aggregate amount of $250,000.

2.7. CONVERSION OPTIONS.

2.7.1. CONVERSION TO DIFFERENT TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION ADVANCE.
The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert any Outstanding
Construction Advance to a Construction Advance of another Type, provided
that (a) with respect to any such conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Advance
to a Base Rate Advance, (i) the Borrower shall give the Bank at least two
(2) Business Days prior written notice of such election and (ii) such
conversion shall only be made on the last day of the Interest Period with
respect thereto; (b) with respect to any such conversion of a Base Rate
Advance to a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall give the Bank at
least three (3) Eurodollar Business Days prior written notice of such
election and (c) no Construction Advance may be converted into a Eurodollar
Rate Advance when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing.  On the date on which such conversion is being made the Bank
shall take such action as is necessary to transfer such Construction
Advances to its Domestic Lending Office or its Eurodollar Lending Office,
as the case may be.  All or any part of Outstanding Construction Advances
of any Type may be converted as provided herein, provided that partial
conversions shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $250,000 or a
whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.  Each Conversion Request
relating to the conversion of a Construction Advance to a Eurodollar Rate
Advance shall be irrevocable by the Borrower.

2.7.2. CONTINUATION OF TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION ADVANCE. Any
Construction Advances of any Type may be continued as such upon the
expiration of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the
Borrower with the notice provisions contained in (S)2.7.1; provided that no
Eurodollar Rate Advance may be continued as such when any Default or Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, but shall be automatically
converted to a Base Rate Advance on the last day of the first Interest
Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or
Event of Default of which the officers of the Bank active upon the
Borrower's account have actual knowledge.  In the event that the Borrower
fails to provide any such notice with respect to the continuation of any
Eurodollar Rate Advance as such, then such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be
automatically converted to a Base Rate Advance on the last day of the first
Interest Period relating thereto.
<PAGE>

17

2.7.3. EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES. Any conversion to or from
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to
such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate
principal amount of all Eurodollar Rate Advances having the same Interest
Period shall not be less than $250,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in
excess thereof.

2.8. FUNDS FOR CONSTRUCTION ADVANCES.

2.8.1. FUNDING PROCEDURES. Upon the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in (S)10 and (S)11 the Bank will make available to the Borrower
the requested Construction Advance in the manner provided in (S)2.8.2.

2.8.2. CONSTRUCTION ADVANCES TO BORROWER OR BUILDER. All
Construction Advances made pursuant to this (S)2.8.2 shall be made, at the
sole and absolute discretion of the Bank, either directly to the Borrower
or directly to the Builder for deposit in an appropriately designated
special bank account. In the event that a Construction Advance is made to
the Borrower, the Borrower covenants and agrees that it will, within three
(3) Business Days after the Drawdown Date of such Construction Advance,
provide the Bank with evidence, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Bank, that the Borrower shall have paid the invoices
for work performed or materials supplied which were submitted by the
Borrower to the Bank with the Construction Advance Request corresponding to
such Construction Advance. In addition, the execution of this Loan
Agreement by the Borrower shall, and hereby does, constitute an irrevocable
authorization to disburse the proceeds of the Construction Advances to fund
progress payments to the Builder when due, in accordance with the
provisions of the Contract. No further authorization from the Borrower
shall be necessary to warrant such direct disbursements of the proceeds of
the Construction Advances to the Builder and all such disbursements shall
(i) be deemed to be Construction Advances hereunder, (ii) satisfy the
obligations of the Bank hereunder and (iii) be secured by the Security
Documents as fully as if made directly to the Borrower.

2.8.3. CONSTRUCTION ADVANCES TO OTHERS. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default and following
five (5) days prior written notice to the Borrower (provided that such
prior notice is not required if in the reasonable opinion of the Bank such
prior notice would adversely affect the Collateral or the rights and
benefits of the Bank in respect of the Collateral), the Bank may disburse
all or any portion of the proceeds of any Construction Advance to any
Person to whom the Bank after reasonable inquiry and in good faith
determines payment is due for goods delivered, services rendered or
<PAGE>

18

expenditures incurred in connection with the Project, or in order to
preserve and protect the Collateral in relation to the Project, and any
portion of a Construction Advance so disbursed by the Bank shall be deemed
disbursed as of the date on which the Bank makes such disbursement. Subject
to the provisions of this paragraph, the execution of this Loan Agreement
by the Borrower shall, and hereby does, constitute an irrevocable
authorization so to disburse the proceeds of any Construction Advance and
no further authorization from the Borrower shall be necessary to warrant
such direct disbursements and all such disbursements shall (i) be deemed to
be Construction Advances hereunder, (ii) satisfy the obligations of the
Bank hereunder and (iii) be secured by the Security Documents as fully as
if made directly to the Borrower.

2.8.4. ADVANCES PURSUANT TO CONTRACT. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Bank may fund
additional Construction Advances to the Builder or any other Person the
Bank deems necessary to continue and complete all or a portion of the
construction of the Vessel (the Bank hereby agreeing to promptly notify the
Borrower of any such funding). The execution of this Loan Agreement by the
Borrower shall, and hereby does, constitute an irrevocable authorization to
make such Construction Advances and disburse the proceeds in accordance
with this (S)2.8.4, and such Advances shall (i) be deemed to be
Construction Advances hereunder, and (ii) be secured by the Security
Documents as fully as if requested directly by the Borrower and made
directly to the Borrower.

2.8.5. CONSTRUCTION ADVANCES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER.
No Construction Advance made by the Bank shall constitute a waiver of any
of the conditions to the obligation of the Bank to make further
Construction Advances nor, in the event that the Borrower or either of the
Guarantors fails to satisfy any such condition, shall any such Construction
Advance have the effect of precluding the Bank from thereafter declaring
such failure to satisfy a condition to be an Event of Default.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Bank shall have no
obligation to make a Construction Advance if the conditions set forth in
(S)10 and (S)11 have not been satisfied.

3.  REPAYMENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION LOAN.

the Borrower shall immediately pay the amount of such excess to the Bank for

3.3. OPTIONAL REPAYMENTS OF CONSTRUCTION LOAN. The Borrower shall have the
right, at its election, to repay the Outstanding amount of the Construction

and three (3) Eurodollar Business Days notice of any proposed repayment of
Eurodollar Rate Advances pursuant to this (S)3.3, in each case, specifying the
proposed date of payment of Construction Advances and the principal amount to be

integral multiple of $100,000, shall be accompanied by the payment of accrued
interest on the principal repaid to the date of payment and shall be applied, in
the absence of instruction by the Borrower, first to the principal of Base Rate
Advances and then to the principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances.

compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature now or hereafter
imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof
or taxing or other authority therein unless the Borrower is compelled by
law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such obligation is
imposed upon the Borrower with respect to any amount payable by it
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrower will pay
to the Bank, on the date on which such amount is due and payable hereunder
or under such other Loan Document, such additional amount in Dollars as
shall be necessary to enable the Bank to receive the same net amount which
the Bank would have received on such due date had no such obligation been
imposed upon the Borrower. The Borrower will deliver promptly to the Bank
certificates or other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges
deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the Borrower
hereunder or under such other Loan Document.

4.3. COMPUTATIONS. All computations of interest on the Construction
Advances and of commitment or other fees shall be based on a 360-day year and

definition of the term "Interest Period" with respect to Eurodollar Rate
Advances, whenever a payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents
becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall accrue
during such extension. The Outstanding amount of the Advances as reflected on
the Note Record from time to time shall be prima facie evidence of the amounts
so Outstanding.

4.4. INABILITY TO DETERMINE EURODOLLAR RATE. In the event that, prior to
the commencement of any Interest Period relating to any Eurodollar Rate Advance,
the Bank shall determine that adequate and reasonable methods do not exist for
ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate that would otherwise determine the rate of
interest to be applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Advance during any Interest
Period, the Bank shall forthwith give notice of such determination (which shall
be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) to the Borrower. In such event (a)
each Construction Advance Request or Conversion Request with respect to each
Eurodollar Rate Advance shall be automatically withdrawn and shall be deemed a
request for a Base Rate Advance, (b) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, on the last day of the then current Interest Period thereof,
become a Base Rate Advance, and (c) the obligations of the Bank to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Bank determines that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, whereupon the Bank
shall so notify the Borrower.
<PAGE>

4.5. ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any
present or future law, regulation, treaty or directive or the interpretation or
application thereof shall make it unlawful for the Bank to make or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Bank shall forthwith give notice of such
circumstances to the Borrower and thereupon (a) the commitment of the Bank to
make Eurodollar Rate Advances or convert Advances of another Type to Eurodollar
Rate Advances shall forthwith be suspended and (b) the Advances then Outstanding
as Eurodollar Rate Advances, if any, shall be converted automatically to Base
Rate Advances on the last day of each Interest Period applicable to such
Eurodollar Rate Advances or within such earlier period as may be required by
law. The Borrower hereby agrees to promptly pay the Bank, upon demand, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate the Bank for any costs incurred by
the Bank in making any conversion in accordance with this (S)4.5, including any
interest or fees payable by the Bank to lenders of funds obtained by it in order
to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder.

4.6. ADDITIONAL COSTS, ETC. If any present or future applicable law, which
expression, as used herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations thereunder
and interpretations thereof by any competent court or by any governmental or
other regulatory body or official charged with the administration or the
interpretation thereof and requests, directives, instructions and notices at any
time or from time to time hereafter made upon or otherwise issued to the Bank by
any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority (whether or not
having the force of law), shall:

(a)  subject the Bank to any tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, fee,
deduction or withholding of any nature with respect to this Loan Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, the Commitment or the Advances (other than taxes
based upon or measured by the revenue, income or profits of the Bank), or

(b)  materially change the basis of taxation (except for changes in
taxes on revenue, income or profits) of payments to the Bank of the
principal of or the interest on the Advances or any other amounts payable
to the Bank under this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or

(c)  impose or increase or render applicable (other than to the extent
specifically provided for elsewhere in this Loan Agreement) any special
deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other similar
requirements (whether or not having the force of law) against assets held
by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans by, or commitments of an
office of the Bank, or

(d)  impose on the Bank any other conditions or requirements with
respect to this Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
<PAGE>

22

Advances, the Commitment, or any class of loans or commitments of which the
Advances or the Commitment forms a part, and the result of any of the
foregoing is

(i)  to increase the cost to the Bank of making, funding,
issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining the Advances or the
Commitment, or

(ii)  to reduce the amount of principal, interest or other amount
payable to the Bank hereunder on account of the Commitment or the
Advances, or

(iii)  to require the Bank to make any payment or to forego any
interest or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment
or foregone interest or other sum is calculated by reference to the
gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by the Bank from
the Borrower hereunder,

then, and in each such case, the Borrower will, upon demand made by the Bank at
any time and from time to time and as often as the occasion therefor may arise,
pay to the Bank such additional amounts as will be sufficient to compensate the
Bank for such additional cost, reduction, payment or foregone interest or other
sum.

4.7. CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If after the date hereof the Bank determines that
(a) the adoption of or change in any law, governmental rule, regulation, policy,
guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) regarding
capital requirements for banks or bank holding companies or any change in the
interpretation or application thereof by a court or governmental authority with
appropriate jurisdiction, or (b) compliance by the Bank or any corporation
controlling the Bank with any law, governmental rule, regulation, policy,
guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
entity regarding capital adequacy, has the effect of reducing the return on the
Commitment or the Advances to a level below that which the Bank could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
the Bank's then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming
full utilization of the Bank's capital) by any amount deemed by the Bank to be
material, then the Bank may notify the Borrower of such fact. To the extent that
the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not reflected in the
Base Rate, the Borrower agrees to pay the Bank for the amount of such reduction
in the return on capital as and when such reduction is determined upon
presentation by the Bank of a certificate in accordance with (S)4.8 hereof. The
Bank shall allocate such cost increases among its customers in good faith and on
an equitable basis.

4.8. CERTIFICATE. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts
payable pursuant to (S)4.6 or 4.7 and a brief explanation of such amounts which
<PAGE>

23

are due, submitted by the Bank to the Borrower, shall be conclusive evidence,
absent manifest error, that such amounts are due and owing.

4.9. INDEMNITY. Except to the extent of breakage costs arising from a
prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance as a result of an event set forth in
(S)4.4, the Borrower agrees to indemnify the Bank and to hold the Bank harmless
from and against any loss, cost or expense (including loss of anticipated
profits) that the Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by
the Borrower in payment of the principal amount of or any interest on any
Eurodollar Rate Advances as and when due and payable, including any such loss or
expense arising from interest or fees payable by the Bank to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to maintain its Eurodollar Rate Advances, (b) default by
the Borrower in making a borrowing after the Borrower has given (or is deemed to
have given) a Construction Advance Request or a Conversion Request relating
thereto in accordance with (S)2.6 or (S)2.7 or (c) the making of any payment on
a Eurodollar Rate Advance or the making of any conversion of any such Advance to
a Base Rate Advance on a day that is not the last day of the applicable Interest
Period with respect thereto, including interest or fees payable by the Bank to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain any such Advances.

4.10. INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.

4.10.1. OVERDUE AMOUNTS. Overdue principal and (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) interest on the Advances and all other overdue
amounts payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents shall
bear interest compounded monthly and payable on demand at a rate per annum
equal to two percent (2%) above the rate applicable to Base Rate Advances
until such amount shall be paid in full (after as well as before judgment).

4.10.2. AMOUNTS NOT OVERDUE. During the continuance of an Event of
Default the principal of the Advances not overdue shall, from and after the
fifth day after such Event of Default and until such Event of Default has
been cured or remedied or such Event of Default has been waived by the Bank
pursuant to (S)24, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater
of (i) two percent (2%) above the rate of interest otherwise applicable to
the Advances pursuant to (S)2.5 and (ii) the rate of interest applicable to
overdue principal pursuant to (S)4.10.1.

4.11. RIGHT TO RETAIN THE CONSTRUCTION INSPECTOR.

The Bank shall have the right to retain, at the Borrower's cost and expense
(not to exceed $8,000), the Construction Inspector to perform the following
services on behalf of the Bank:

(a)  to make periodic inspections (i) for the purpose of providing the Bank
with an opinion to satisfy the conditions set forth in (S)10.12 and (S)11.5
hereof, and (ii) otherwise for the purpose of assuring that construction of the
Vessel to the date thereof is in accordance with the Plans and Specifications,
and to advise the Bank of the anticipated cost of and time for completion of
construction of the vessel; and

forthwith upon billing therefor and expenses incurred by the Bank on account
thereof shall be reimbursed to the Bank forthwith upon request therefor, but the
Bank shall not have any liability to the Borrower on account of (i) the services
performed by the Construction Inspector, (ii) any neglect or failure on the part
of the Construction Inspector to properly perform its services, or (iii) any
approval by the Construction Inspector of construction of the Vessel.  Neither
the Bank nor the Construction Inspector assumes any obligation to the Borrower
or any other Person concerning the quality of construction of the Vessel or the
absence therefrom of defects.

5. SECURITY AND GUARANTIES.

guaranteed by the Guarantors pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty.

and deposits of documents or instruments have been made and all other actions
have been taken that are necessary, under applicable law, to establish and

6.15. CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. Except for transactions permitted under the
Parent Credit Agreement, none of the officers, directors, or employees of the
Borrower or either of the Guarantors is currently a party to any transaction
with Borrower or either of the Guarantors (other than for services as employees,
officers and directors), including any contract, agreement or other arrangement
providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing for rental of real
or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from any
officer, director or such employee or, to the knowledge of the Borrower or
either of the Guarantors, any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity in
which any officer, director, or any such employee has a substantial interest or
is an officer, director, trustee or partner.

6.16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

6.16.1. IN GENERAL. Except as disclosed on Schedule 6.16, each
Employee Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated in compliance in all
material respects with the provisions of ERISA and, to the extent
applicable, the Code, including but not limited to the provisions
thereunder respecting prohibited transactions. The Borrower has heretofore
delivered to the Bank the most recently completed annual report, Form 5500,
with all required attachments, and actuarial statement required to be
submitted under (S)103(d) of ERISA, with respect to each Guaranteed Pension
Plan.

6.16.2. TERMINABILITY OF WELFARE PLANS. Under each Employee Benefit
Plan which is an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of
(S)3(1) or (S)3(2)(B) of ERISA, no benefits are due unless the event giving
rise to the benefit entitlement occurs prior to plan termination (except as
required by Title I, Part 6 of ERISA). The Borrower, each Guarantor or an
ERISA Affiliate, as appropriate, may terminate each such plan at any time
(or at any time subsequent to the expiration of any applicable bargaining
agreement) in the discretion of the Borrower, such Guarantor or such ERISA
Affiliate without liability to any Person other than for premiums, payments
and contributions accrued but unpaid as of such date of termination or
subsequently accrued for periods prior to such date.

6.16.3. GUARANTEED PENSION PLANS. Each contribution required to be
made to a Guaranteed Pension Plan, whether required to be made to avoid the
incurrence of an accumulated funding deficiency, the notice or lien
provisions of (S)302(f) of ERISA, or otherwise, has been timely made. No
waiver of an accumulated funding deficiency or extension of amortization
periods has been received with respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan. No
liability to the PBGC (other than required insurance premiums, all of which
have been paid) has been incurred by the Borrower, either Guarantor or any
ERISA Affiliate with respect to any
<PAGE>

30

Guaranteed Pension Plan and since January 1, 1991 there has not been any
ERISA Reportable Event, or any other event or condition which presents a
material risk of termination of any Guaranteed Pension Plan by the PBGC.
Based on the latest valuation of each Guaranteed Pension Plan (which in
each case occurred within twelve months of the date of this
representation), and on the actuarial methods and assumptions employed for
that valuation, the aggregate benefit liabilities of all such Guaranteed
Pension Plans within the meaning of (S)4001 of ERISA did not exceed the
aggregate value of the assets of all such Guaranteed Pension Plans,
disregarding for this purpose the benefit liabilities and assets of any
Guaranteed Pension Plan with assets in excess of benefit liabilities.

6.16.4. MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS. Neither the Borrower, either Guarantor
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material liability (including
secondary liability) to any Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or
partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan under (S)4201 of ERISA or
as a result of a sale of assets described in (S)4204 of ERISA. Neither the
Borrower, either Guarantor nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified that
any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization or insolvent under and within
the meaning of (S)4241 or (S)4245 of ERISA or that any Multiemployer Plan
intends to terminate or has been terminated under (S)4041A of ERISA.

6.17. PURPOSE; REGULATIONS U AND X. The proceeds of the Construction Loan
shall be used to finance the construction of the Vessel. No portion of the
Construction Loan is to be used for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any
"margin security" or "margin stock" as such terms are used in Regulations U and
X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R. Parts 221
and 224.

6.18. SUBSIDIARIES, ETC. Moran and Towing have only those Subsidiaries
listed on Schedule 6.18 hereto. The Borrower has no Subsidiaries. Except as set
forth on Schedule 6.18 hereto, neither the Borrower nor either Guarantor is
engaged in any joint venture or partnership with any other person.

6.19. REAL PROPERTY. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.19, neither of the
Guarantors nor the Borrower owns or leases (as lessee or sublessee) any real
property.

6.20. DISCLOSURE. Neither this Loan Agreement nor any of the other Loan
Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements herein or therein not
misleading. There is no fact known to either the Borrower or either of the
Guarantors which materially adversely affects, or which would reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect in the future, exclusive of
<PAGE>

31

effects resulting from changes in general economic or industry conditions, the
business, assets, financial condition or prospects of the Borrower or of the
Guarantors and their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

6.21. FISCAL YEAR. The fiscal year of the Borrower, Moran and the other
Guarantors is the twelve months ending December 31 of each year.

6.22. INSURANCE. Schedule 6.23 attached hereto lists the P&I and hull
policies and types and amounts of coverage (including deductibles) owned or held
by the Borrower and the Guarantors on the date hereof. Such policies of
insurance are maintained with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies, funds, underwriters or mutual indemnification associations and are of
the kinds, cover such risks and are in such amounts, with such deductibles and
exclusions, as are required under (S)7.7 hereof and under the Security
Documents. All such policies are in full force and effect; are sufficient for
compliance by the Borrower and the Guarantors with all requirements of law and
all agreements to which the Borrower or the Guarantors are a party; are by their
terms valid and enforceable policies that will remain in full force and effect
through the respective dates set forth in such schedule; and coverage thereunder
will not be reduced by, or terminate or lapse by reason of, the transactions
contemplated by this Loan Agreement.

6.23. CONTRACT. The Contract is in full force and effect and both the
Borrower and the Builder are in compliance in all material respects with their
respective obligations under such contract. The work to be performed under the
Contract is the work called for by the Plans and Specifications. All work
required to complete the construction in accordance with the Plans and
Specifications is provided for under the Contract.

7. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS OF THE BORROWER AND THE GUARANTORS.

The Borrower and the Guarantors covenant and agree that, so long as the
Construction Loan or the Note is Outstanding or the Bank has any obligation to

discretion make proper allowance to take into account any Obligations not
then due and payable;

The Borrower and each of the Guarantors hereby waive their right to a jury
trial with respect to any action or claim arising out of any dispute in
connection with this Loan Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan
Documents, any rights or obligations hereunder or thereunder or the performance
of such rights and obligations.  Except as prohibited by law, the Borrower and
each of the Guarantors hereby waive any right they may have to claim or recover
in any litigation referred to in the preceding sentence any special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages or any damages other than, or in addition to,
actual damages.  The Borrower and each of the Guarantors (a) certify that no
representative, agent or attorney of the Bank has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that the Bank would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waivers and (b) acknowledge that the Bank has been induced to
enter into this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a
party by, among other things, the waivers and certifications contained herein.

instance and either retroactively or prospectively) with, but only with, the
written consent of the Borrower and the written consent of the Bank. No waiver
shall extend to or affect any obligation not expressly waived or impair any
right consequent thereon. No course of dealing or delay or omission on the part
of the Bank in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or
otherwise be prejudicial thereto. No notice to or demand upon the Borrower shall
entitle the Borrower to other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

in any manner affect such clause or provision in any other jurisdiction, or any
other clause or provision of this Loan Agreement in any jurisdiction.

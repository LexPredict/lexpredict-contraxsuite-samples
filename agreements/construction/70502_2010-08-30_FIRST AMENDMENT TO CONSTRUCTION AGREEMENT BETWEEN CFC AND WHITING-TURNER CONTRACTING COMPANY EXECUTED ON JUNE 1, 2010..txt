Glazing System Clarifications:









28.


The exterior glazing aluminum framing system is based on a system manufactured by Accura Systems, Inc. This is system can be reglazed from the exterior in a repair situation by the way of an adaptor. The system is not a pressure glazed system at the punched openings. The system will be unitized with the exception of the stairwells. The curtainwalls at stairs A and B will be pressure glazed. (Re: 0841 0-5-2.I-A.2). The system will have dimensions of 2 1/2" x 6" at typical punched opening locations and 2 1/2" x 7 1/2 at the stairwells as shown on the documents.














29.


The ACCQ-WALL system by Accura at the stairwell is a classic "pressure equalized" system with the primary seal to the inside face of glass. The ACCUNIT system by Accura at all other locations is not classified as a "classic" pressure equalized system since the primary line of seal is the exterior face of glass. Both of the systems incorporate basic "rain screen" principles, but the primary vapor/air seal is not the interior face of system. Both of the proposed systems have been tested in accordance with AAMA guidelines by independent laboratories and will meet or exceed the air and water performance specified. The systems will offer the 5 year warranty specified. (Re: 08400-7-1.6-G)














30.


The exterior glazing aluminum framing system is designed to accommodate +/-3/8" live load deflection in either direction for a total deflection of 3/4" as specified (Re: 08400-5-1.6-C.7b and 08410-5-1.6-C.I). The system requires a 3/4" caulk joint. If a 3/4" deflection in either direction is required for both floors, the framing system would require modification and a 1-1/2" caulk joi
nt at the head, the cost for which is not included in Amendment No.1.














31.


The glazing aluminum framing system specifications contain conflicting information on warranties. Specification Section 08400: 1.13.B & 08520: 1.13.A.1(a) calls for a 5 yr. performance warranty and Section 08410: 1.4.A.1(a) indicates a 10 yr. performance warranty (note: 08410: l.4.B also calls for a 5 yr. performance warranty). Specification Section 05080: 1.5.A calls for a 20 yr. finish warranty, but Section 08520: 1.1 3.1 (c) calls for a 10 yr. finish warranty. A 5-year material warranty and a 20-year finish warranty are included. Warranty on workmanship is for a period of two (2) years from the date of substantial completion.














32.


Warranties from the manufacturer (ACCURA) and Glass Contractor/Installer will be issued separately and will not be jointly signed (Re: 08400-9-1.13-B).














33.


An insulated glass manufacturer warranty against glass breakage is not available. Glass Contractor/lnstaller and ACCVRA will replace glass damaged by their workmanship (Re: Section 08400-9-1.13-B & Section 08520).














34.


The specified U-Factor of .08 is not attainable. The aluminum framing system being provided is tested to meet a U-Value of .50 at all frames except the stair towers, and a .59 U-Factor at the stair tower curtainwalls (Re: 08400-6-1.6­-E.2).














35.


All field testing shall be done in accordance with AAMA and ASTM. In accordance with these entities, a field tested product is not required to meet the same performances as the laboratory tested frame. (Re: 08400-11-3.3-C). An informal non certified laboratory test will be completed at Service Glass' shop in Frederick, MD, including the stainless steel cavity closure. Test will be conducted using AAMA guidelines. Onsite field testing will be by Service Glass Personnel using AAMA 501.2 and ASTM standards. No other field testing is to be done other than the 501.2 hose test. Glass Contractor workmanship warranty duration is for a duration of two (2) years. ACCURA will warrant materials for a 5-year duration but this does not include labor; it is a parts only warranty. (Re: 08410-4-1.4­-A).














36.


Glass Contractor workmanship warranty duration is for a duration of two (2) years. ACCURA will warrant








































materials for a 5-year duration but this does not include labor; it is a parts only warranty. (Re: 08410-4-1.4-A).









37.

43.


Aluminum framing system Specification Section 08520 calls for a 5-year material duration which is in agreement with paragraph B of the Aluminum Entrances and Window Walls specification (Re: 08410-4-1.4-B)














44.


The glass warranty from the specified manufacturer for fritted and silkscreened glass is a of 5-year warranty, not a ten-year warranty as specified (Re: 08800-6-1.14-A).














45.


Certifications and manufacturers or subcontractors special statements indicated in Specification Section 08800-2-1.5-­B are may not be available from the manufacturers. These will be available when available.














46.


Note the following manufacturer notes regarding warranties as they apply to edge flaws (Re: 08800-6-1.14-A.2 and 3):














•


The following conditions will be considered unacceptable for annealed glass. These conditions are allowable in heat-treated glass provided dimensional tolerances are met:







• Vee chips.


• Shark teeth that exceed one half of the glass thickness.


• Serration hackle which exceeds one quarter of the glass thickness or if spalling is present.


• A flare that exceeds one eighth of the glass thickness.


• A bevel that exceeds one quarter of the glass thickness.


• Plier-nipped edges.


•             The following is allowable for heat treated glass.


• Shell Chips which exceed the following dimensions:


a.  Covered Edge: 1/4" (6mm) L X 1/4" (6mm) W Max.


b. Exposed Edge: 1/4" (6mm) L X 1/8" (3mm) W Max.





























•


These edge conditions will not affect glass strength in heat-treated glass when they exist prior to heat-treating. This process is severe and will break glass with weakening edge conditions.














47.


Except for the Visual Mock-up, samples are based on providing manufacturers' standard size samples. Special size samples are not included (Re: 08400-2-1.3-F, 08410-3-1.3-F, 08520-3-1.3-H, and 08800-2-1.3-B).














48.

(Re: 08400-3-1.4­-B,08410-3-I.3-C,and 08520-3-1.4). Calculationswillbeprovidedinbookletformincorporatingdetailsfromthe shop drawings. The shop drawings themselves are not stamped since they incorporate materials from other trades (e.g. concrete, metal studs, precast. etc.).














49.

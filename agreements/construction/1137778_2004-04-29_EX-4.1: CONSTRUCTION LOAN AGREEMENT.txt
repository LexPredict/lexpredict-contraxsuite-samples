Services) as of 11:00 a.m. London time on the day that is two (2) London

Dow Jones Market Services on any applicable interest determination date, the
LIBOR rate shall be the rate (rounded upward, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point), determined on the basis of the
offered rates for deposits in U.S. Dollars for a period of time comparable to
the Interest Period for such LIBOR Advance which are offered by four major banks
in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time, on the
day that is two (2) London Business Days preceding the first day of the Interest

In the event that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall
impose a Reserve Percentage with respect to LIBOR deposits of any Lender, then
for any period during which such Reserve Percentage shall apply, LIBOR with
respect to Advances owing to such Lender shall be equal to the amount determined
above divided by an amount equal to one (1) minus the Reserve Percentage.

ARTICLE 2
AGREEMENT TO MAKE ADVANCES: LIMITATIONS.

2.1      AGREEMENT TO MAKE ADVANCES. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Lenders, each to their respective Commitment,
agree to lend to Borrower and Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow from time
to time after the Effective Date and upon submission by Borrower of a Draw
Request in accordance with Section 3.1, such amounts as are requested by
Borrower up to a maximum aggregate principal amount equal to the Loan Amount,
provided that (i) the sum of the Outstanding Advances (after giving effect to
all amounts requested) shall not at any time exceed the Borrowing Base; and (ii)
such amounts are to pay for Project Costs actually incurred by Borrower and
reflected in and with respect to the Project Budgets as being funded by the
Loan. Each Draw Request for an Advance hereunder shall constitute a
representation and warranty by Borrower that, with respect to the applicable
Projects, the conditions set forth in Article 11, in the case of the initial
Advance, and Article 12, in the case of all other Advances have been satisfied
on the date of such Draw Request. The parties hereto agree that each Lender's
obligation to make Advances under the Loan is limited to each such Lender's
respective Commitment. The Commitments shall terminate, and the Loan shall
mature and become due and payable on the Maturity Date or on such earlier date
on which Borrower terminates the Commitments hereunder or on which the maturity
thereof is accelerated pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.2. Borrower
agrees to pay all Obligations on the Maturity Date, to the extent not paid
earlier as required herein.

2.2      LOAN AMOUNT PROJECT ALLOCATIONS.

2.2.1    For the purpose of allocating the use of the Loan
Amount, Borrower and Lenders agree that the Loan Amount Project Allocations
shall be as shown in the Project Schedules attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that,

21

<PAGE>

notwithstanding that the amount of the aggregate Loan Amount Project Allocations
may exceed the Loan Amount, it is anticipated that the Projects will be in
varying stages of completion at any given time and, thus, the Loan Amount
Project Allocations will not be fully funded or some will be repaid or partially
repaid as to certain Projects before the Loan Amount Project Allocations as to
certain other Projects are fully funded.

2.2.2    Borrower recognizes and agrees that the Lenders made
the Loan secured by all Projects based on the Lenders' valuation of all Projects
combined having sufficient value to support the Loan; therefore, it is the
intention of Borrower, Agent, and Lenders that the Loan is secured in whole by
all the property described in the Security Instruments, including all of the
Projects.

2.2.3    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.2, the parties agree that they have not "designated a portion of the
construction loan proceeds" within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ss.713.3471 (2003),
and that any disbursement of the proceeds of the Loan shall be subject to and
conditioned on compliance with the applicable terms, covenants, conditions and
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

2.3      UNUSED FEE. Borrower shall pay to Agent an unused fee ("Unused
Fee") quarterly in arrears on the first day of each Fiscal Quarter for the
immediately preceding Fiscal Quarter and on the Maturity Date. The Unused Fee
shall be distributed to the Lenders (excluding Defaulting Lenders) pro rata in
accordance with their respective Loan Percentage. The amount of the Unused Fee
shall be calculated for any Fiscal Quarter by multiplying 0.20% per annum times
a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of the calculations of the Unused
Fee Availability for each day in such period and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such period. For the purposes of this calculation, the term
"Unused Fee Availability" shall mean, as of any date, the first fifty percent
(50%) of the Loan Amount minus the Outstanding Advances.

2.4      INCREASE IN TOTAL COMMITMENT. At any time prior to the last
twelve (12) months of the term of this Agreement, as same may be extended
pursuant to Section 4.6, Agent may in its discretion (which discretion shall not
be arbitrarily or unreasonably exercised so long as the conditions set forth
below are satisfied), from time to time at the request of Borrower, increase the
Loan Amount by (i) admitting additional Lenders hereunder (each a "Subsequent
Lender"), or (ii) increasing the Commitment of any Lender (each an "Increasing
Lender"), subject to the following conditions:

2.4.1    each Subsequent Lender is an Eligible Assignee;

2.4.2    the Borrower executes in replacement of the Accordion
Note (i) a new Note payable to the order of each Subsequent Lender, or a
replacement Note payable to the order of each Increasing Lender; and (ii) to the
extent the amount of the increase is less than the then current face amount of
the Accordion Note, a replacement Accordion Note payable to the order of the
Agent;

2.4.3    each Subsequent Lender executes and delivers to Agent
a signature page to this Agreement;

22

<PAGE>

2.4.4    Borrower and Agent shall have executed modifications
of the Security Instruments and other Loan Documents to reflect the increase in
the Loan Amount and Borrower shall have paid to Agent any and all documentary
stamp tax, non-recurring intangible tax or other taxes imposed in connection
with the recording of such modifications of the Security Instruments or increase
in the Loan Amount;

2.4.5    Borrower shall have delivered to Agent endorsements
to the Title Policies increasing the amount of the Title Policies to the new
Loan Amount and insuring Agent and the Lenders that the Security Instruments, as
modified to reflect the increase in the Loan Amount, shall continue to
constitute a first priority lien on the Projects (subject to customary pending
disbursements language in such Title Policies);

2.4.6    after giving effect to the admission of any
Subsequent Lender or the increase in the Commitment of any Increasing Lender,
the Loan Amount does not exceed $340,000,000.00;

2.4.7    each increase in the Loan Amount shall be in the
amount of at least $10,000,000.00 for Subsequent Lenders, or at least
$5,000,000.00 for Increasing Lenders, or, in either case, a greater integral
multiple of $5,000,000.00;

2.4.8    no admission of any Subsequent Lender shall increase
the Commitment of any existing Lender without the written consent of such
Lender;

this Agreement.

2.5.4    With respect to Projects added after the Effective
Date of this Agreement and owned by Guarantors, all of the agreements,
undertakings, representations, warranties, and covenants of and provisions

25

<PAGE>

reduction or termination, Borrower shall pay to Agent for the account of the
Lenders the full amount of any accrued but unpaid Unused Fee.

2.7      PROJECT BUDGETS. Each of the Project Budgets reflects, by
category and line items, the purposes and the estimated amounts for which funds
to be advanced by Agent and Lenders under this Agreement are to be used. Agent
and Lenders shall not be required to disburse for any category or line item more
than the amount specified therefor in the applicable Project Budget, except as
provided in Sections 2.10 and 2.11 hereof.

2.8      AMOUNT OF ADVANCES.

2.8.1    With respect to each Project, in no event shall Agent

applicable Loan Amount Project Allocation for such Project, (ii) the aggregate
Adjusted Project Costs actually incurred by Borrower for such Project, or (iii)
the Borrowing Base for such Project.

2.8.2    With respect to each Project, in no event shall any

<PAGE>

2.10     COST OVERRUNS; CHANGE ORDERS.

2.10.1   If Borrower becomes aware of any change in Project
Costs which will increase the corresponding Project Budget (as the Project
Budgets are revised from time to time and approved by Agent) by more than five
percent (5%) of the total of such Project Budget, Borrower shall immediately
notify Agent in writing and shall promptly submit to Agent for its approval a
revised Project Budget. In such event, no further Advances with respect to such
Project need be made by the Lenders unless and until (i) the revised Project
Budget so submitted is approved by Agent, (ii) Borrower has deposited with Agent
any Required Equity Funds or additional equity funds to offset such increase or
Agent has otherwise approved a timetable for the making of such deposits, or
(iii) the Majority Lenders have approved an adjustment to the Loan Amount

<PAGE>

(d)      all Stored Materials stored off-site shall

ARTICLE 3
MAKING THE ADVANCES.

3.1      DRAW REQUEST. At such time as Borrower shall desire to obtain
an Advance for a particular Project, in addition to satisfying the conditions
set forth in Article 12 hereof on a Project-by-Project basis, and providing to
Agent and Lenders the items set forth in Section 12.5 hereof on a
Project-by-Project basis, Borrower shall complete, execute and deliver to Agent,
Borrower's Requisition for Advance in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto and
by this reference incorporated herein (hereinafter referred to as "Borrower's
Requisition for Advance"). Each Borrower's Requisition for Advance shall be
accompanied by the following items in form reasonably acceptable to Agent:

3.1.1    If Borrower's Requisition for Advance includes Direct
Costs to be paid to a Contractor under the applicable Construction Contract, a
completed and fully itemized Application and Certificate for Payment (AIA
Document G702 and G703) containing the certification of Borrower, such
Contractor and the applicable Architect as to the accuracy of same, and a
payment requisition and lien affidavit signed by such Contractor and Borrower,
respectively, in the forms of Exhibits D and E attached hereto and by this
reference incorporated herein;

3.1.2    If Borrower's Requisition for Advance includes
payments for Indirect Costs in excess of the amount described in Section 2.10.1
above, a completed Indirect Cost statement executed by Borrower;

3.1.3    A Draw Request Summary for each applicable Project;

3.1.4    If Borrower's Requisition for Advance includes
Project Costs under subparagraphs (b) or (c) of the definition of "Borrowing
Base", a current Borrowing Base Report;

28

<PAGE>

3.1.5    An affidavit and partial waiver of lien in the form
of Exhibit F attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein from the
applicable Contractor and such laborers, subcontractors and materialmen for work
done and materials supplied by them since the previous Draw Request;

3.1.6    An inspection report and certification from
Construction Inspector, at Borrower's expense; and

3.1.7    Such other information, documentation and
certification as Agent and Lenders (acting through Agent) shall reasonably
request.

3.2      NOTICE, FREQUENCY, AND AMOUNT OF ADVANCES; EFFECT OF DRAW
REQUEST. Each Draw Request shall be submitted to Agent at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date of the requested Advance, and no more frequently
than once each month for each of the Projects. As required in Section 12.3
below, each Draw Request submitted to Agent and Lenders as provided in Section
3.1 hereof shall constitute an affirmation that the representations and
warranties contained in Article 8 of this Agreement and in the other Loan
Documents remain true and correct as of the date thereof; and, unless Agent and
Lenders are notified in writing to the contrary prior to the Drawdown Date of
the requested Advance or any portion thereof, shall constitute an affirmation
that the same remain true and correct in all material respects on the Drawdown
Date (except to the extent of changes resulting from transactions contemplated
or permitted by the Loan Documents and changes occurring in the ordinary course
of business that either individually or in the aggregate do not result in a
Material Adverse Change); provided, however, that (i) the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 8.3 and 8.4 below shall refer back to the date
of the most recent audited financial statements of Borrower as of the Drawdown
Date rather than December 31, 2003; (ii) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 8.30 below shall refer back to the date of the most recent
sales report for the Projects provided by Borrower pursuant to Section 9.6.3
below; and (iii) the affirmation as to representations and warranties relating
to the Projects shall only be made with respect to Projects covered by each Draw
Request.

3.3      DEPOSIT OF FUNDS ADVANCED. Except as otherwise provided for in
this Section 3.3 and Section 3.4 hereof, Agent shall deposit the proceeds of
each Advance into Borrower's general operating account with Agent and Borrower
hereby authorizes such deposits by Agent. At the request of Agent following an
Event of Default, Borrower shall open and maintain a non-interest bearing loan
checking account with Agent (the "Loan Checking Account"), and during the
continuance of such Event of Default, Agent shall deposit the proceeds of each
Advance into the Loan Checking Account, and Borrower hereby authorizes such
deposits by Agent. Agent shall disburse any Advance from the Loan Checking
Account in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. During the
continuance of such Event of Default, Net Sales Proceeds (Actual) paid to Agent
pursuant to Section 6.3.1 and not applied against payment of the Outstanding
Advances shall also be deposited into the Loan Checking Account.

3.4      ADVANCES TO TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY OR TO OTHERS. At its
option, Agent may make any or all Advances through the Title Insurance Company
and any portion of the Loan so disbursed by Agent shall be deemed disbursed as
of the date on which Agent makes such disbursement. At its option, Agent may
make Advances to any Person to whom Agent in good

29

<PAGE>

faith determines payment is due and any portion of the Loan so disbursed by
Agent shall be deemed disbursed as of the date on which Agent makes such
disbursement. Agent shall endeavor to give Borrower five (5) days prior written
notice of each such Advance unless the giving of such notice is impractical for
reasons of safety or preservation of Collateral. The execution of this Agreement
by Borrower shall, and hereby does, constitute an irrevocable authorization so
to advance the proceeds of the Loan. No further authorization from Borrower
shall be necessary to warrant such direct Advances and all such Advances shall
satisfy the obligations of Agent and Lenders hereunder and shall be secured by
the Security Instruments and the other Security Documents as fully as if made
directly to Borrower.

3.5      ADVANCES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER. No Advance made by Agent
and Lenders shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions to the Lenders'
obligation to make further Advances nor, in the event Borrower fails to satisfy
any such condition, shall any such Advance have the effect of precluding Agent
and Lenders from thereafter declaring such failure to satisfy a condition to be
an Event of Default.

ARTICLE 4
THE NOTES; INTEREST; MATURITY AND PREPAYMENT.

4.1      THE NOTES. The obligation of Borrower to pay the Loan Amount
or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Advances made by Agent
and Lenders hereunder, plus accrued interest thereon, shall be evidenced by the
Notes. In the event any of the Notes is lost, destroyed or mutilated at any time
prior to payment in full of the indebtedness evidenced thereby, Borrower shall,
upon certification of such loss, destruction or mutilation by the applicable
Lender and such Lender's agreement to reimburse Borrower for any reasonable
out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and costs related thereto, execute a new note
substantially in the form of such lost, destroyed or mutilated Note and
designated as a replacement note for such lost, destroyed or mutilated Note. The
Notes shall not be necessary to establish the indebtedness of Borrower to Agent
and Lenders on account of Advances made under this Agreement. The Notes are
executed and delivered by the Borrower in consolidation, renewal and replacement
of the "Notes" as defined in the Existing Loan Agreements. As part of any
amendment, restatement or modification of this Agreement and the issuance of the
new Notes pursuant thereto, each Lender agrees to promptly surrender its
respective Note to Agent upon request therefor. With regard to the Treasury
Note, Borrower shall not be permitted to draw any Advances with respect thereto
unless the Lenders have unanimously agreed to increase the Total Commitment
beyond the amount of the increase which Borrower is permitted to request
pursuant to Section 2.4 of this Agreement, and the other conditions described in
Section 2.4 with respect to such request have been satisfied.

4.2      THE RECORD. Borrower irrevocably authorizes Agent to make or
cause to be made, at or about the time of the Drawdown Date of any Advance or at
the time of receipt of any payment of the principal of the Notes, an appropriate
notation on Agent's Record reflecting the making of such Advance or (as the case
may be) the receipt of such payment. The outstanding amount of the Loan set
forth on Agent's Record shall be prima facie evidence of the principal amount
thereof owing and unpaid to Agent, but the failure to record, or any error in so
recording, any such amount on Agent's Record shall not limit or otherwise affect
the Obligations of

30

<PAGE>

Borrower hereunder or under the Notes to make payments of principal or interest
on the Notes when due.

4.3      INTEREST ON ADVANCES. From and after the date hereof (until
maturity or the occurrence of an Event of Default as provided hereinafter)
interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the Notes which is outstanding
from time to time at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate or the LIBOR, as
selected by Borrower, plus the Applicable Margin for Prime Rate Advances or
LIBOR Advances, as applicable, subject to and in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. Accrued but unpaid interest on each Prime Rate Advance and
LIBOR Advance shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
applicable thereto.

4.4      MATURITY. The entire outstanding principal of the Notes,
together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable
in full, unless sooner paid, on the Maturity Date. Borrower promises to pay to
the Lenders on the Maturity Date, and there shall become absolutely due and
payable on the Maturity Date, all of the Advances outstanding on such date,
together with any and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other sums
and fees due and payable to Lenders hereunder or any other Loan Documents.

4.5      REPAYMENTS. Borrower may, on any Business Day, repay the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of a Type of Advance extended to
Borrower, in whole at any time, or ratably in part from time to time; provided,
however, that:

(a)      With respect to a repayment of a Prime Rate Advance:
(i) Borrower gives same day written notice to Agent not later than 12:00 noon
(Boston time) of any such repayment specifying the principal amount to be
repaid; and (ii) accrued interest to the date of such repayment on the principal
amount repaid shall be billed to Borrower by Agent and paid by Borrower on the
next Interest Payment Date; and

(b)      With respect to a repayment of a LIBOR Advance,
Borrower may repay a LIBOR Advance only upon at least three (3) Business Days
prior written notice to Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable), and unless
such repayment shall occur on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR
Advance, Borrower shall pay such sums as may be due pursuant to Section 4.11
below. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Amounts repaid may be
reborrowed.

4.6      EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE. The Maturity Date may be extended
one (1) time for one (1) year upon Borrower's written request actually received
by Agent at least sixty (60) days prior to the Maturity Date, provided that the
following conditions are met by Borrower:

4.6.1    No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

4.6.2    The representations and warranties in the Loan
Documents shall be true and correct and in all material respects and shall be
recertified by Borrower as of the Maturity Date.

31

<PAGE>

4.6.3    No mechanic's or materialmen's lien or other
encumbrance (excluding Permitted Liens) is likely to result in a Material
Adverse Change shall have been filed and remain in effect against any of the
Projects.

4.6.4    The Title Policies shall have been endorsed and
down-dated in a manner satisfactory to Agent with no additional title change or
exception, except the matters permitted in Section 10.3 or specifically approved
in writing by Agent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

4.6.5    As of the date of the granting of such extension,
there is no Material Adverse Change.

4.6.6    The Loan Amount shall not exceed seventy percent
(70%) of the aggregate appraised value of the Projects (excluding any Units
released from the Security Instruments) and Borrower shall have delivered to
Agent such other information, documents, and supplemental legal opinions as may
be reasonably required by Agent.

4.6.7    Borrower shall execute such modifications and other
documents that Agent may reasonably require and shall pay or reimburse Agent for
all expenses and costs it incurs in connection with such extension.

4.6.8    The Net Sales Proceeds (Projected) are at least
ninety percent (90%) of the aggregate Loan Amount Project Allocations with
respect to unreleased Projects.

4.6.9    Borrower shall pay to Agent for the account of the
Lenders an extension fee on the original Maturity Date in the amount equal to
0.15% of the Loan Amount in effect on the date of such extension request.

4.7      INTEREST RATE SELECTION.

4.7.1    Borrower agrees that each Borrower's Requisition for
Advance submitted to Agent pursuant to Section 3.1 of this Agreement shall be
accompanied by a written notice of Borrower (a "Notice of Borrowing") specifying
(i) the requested Type of Advance comprising such Advance, (ii) in the case of a
LIBOR Advance, the initial Interest Period, and (iii) the amount of each Type of
Advance; provided, however, that each LIBOR Advance shall be in an amount of
$1,000,000.00 or more. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
obligation of Agent and Lenders to make any and all Advances is subject to
Section 4.10 of this Agreement and to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

4.7.2    A Notice of Borrowing with respect to a LIBOR Advance
shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrower. If the information described in
Section 4.7.1 above is not specified by Borrower, Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected a Prime Rate Advance.

4.7.3    If after giving a Notice of Borrowing, Borrower fails
to borrow any LIBOR Advance, Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders against
any loss or expense incurred by Agent and Lenders as a result of such failure as
provided for in Section 4.11 below.

32

<PAGE>

4.8      CONVERSION OF ADVANCES.

4.8.1    Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, upon notice given by Borrower to Agent not later than 12:00 noon
(Boston, Massachusetts time) (i) in the case of Conversions into Prime Rate
Advances on the date of the proposed Conversion, and (ii) in the case of
Conversions into LIBOR Advances on the second Business Day prior to the date of
the proposed Conversion, Borrower may Convert, on any Business Day, one Type of
Advance made to Borrower into another Type of Advance; provided, however, that
(a) any Conversion of LIBOR Advances may be made only on the last day of the
respective Interest Period for such Advances, (b) any Advance Converted to a
LIBOR Advance shall be in an amount of $1,000,000.00 or more, and (c) no Advance
may be Converted to a LIBOR Advance during the continuance of any event which
would entitle Agent to accelerate the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section
13.2 hereof.

4.8.2    Each such notice of Conversion (a "Notice of
Conversion") shall be by telephone, telecopy, telex or cable, in each case
confirmed immediately in writing in the manner specified in Article 23 of this
Agreement, and shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the
date of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such
Conversion is to LIBOR Advances the duration of the initial Interest Period for
such Advances. Each Notice of Conversion with respect to LIBOR Advances shall be
irrevocable and binding on Borrower. Any part of the Loan outstanding which is
not accruing interest at LIBOR or the Default Rate shall accrue interest at the
Prime Rate.

4.9      INTEREST PERIOD SELECTION; ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATES, ETC.

4.9.1    Borrower shall have the option to select Interest
Periods (i) in accordance with Section 4.7 of this Agreement with respect to the
duration of an initial Advance; and (ii) in accordance with Section 4.8 of this
Agreement with respect to the duration of a Converted Advance. As to subsequent
Interest Periods applicable to such Advances, Borrower may select the duration
of the Interest Period by giving notice (which may be by telephone, telecopy,
telex or cable, in each case confirmed immediately in writing in the manner
specified in Article 23 of this Agreement) to Agent not less than two (2)
Business Days prior to the first day of such subsequent Interest Period in the
case of LIBOR Advances. If no such notice is received with respect to an
outstanding Advance, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to Convert the
Advance into a Prime Rate Advance.

4.9.2    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in no event may Borrower have more than six (6) LIBOR Advances in effect
at any one time, which number shall be in addition to any Prime Rate Advances.

4.10     ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (a) if the introduction of or any change in any law or regulation (or
change in the interpretation thereof) applicable to Agent, its LIBOR Lending
Office or to a Lender shall make it unlawful, or (b) if any central agency or
other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Agent, its LIBOR Lending
Office or a Lender shall assert that it is unlawful for Agent or its LIBOR
Lending Office to make LIBOR Advances to Borrower or to continue to fund or
maintain LIBOR Advances to Borrower, then, on giving notice (which may be by
telephone, telecopy, telex or cable, in each

33

<PAGE>

case confirmed immediately in writing in the manner specified in Article 23 of
this Agreement) thereof by Agent to Borrower, (i) the obligation of Agent and
Lenders to Borrower to make LIBOR Advances and to Convert Advances into LIBOR
Advances shall terminate, and (ii) each LIBOR Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then current Interest Period thereof or within such earlier
period as may be required by law or regulation, Convert into a Prime Rate
Advance.

4.11     INDEMNIFICATION. If, due to payments or Conversion to Types of
Advances made by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or due to acceleration of
the maturity of the Advances pursuant to this Agreement or due to any other
reason, including without limitation (i) the events specified in Section 4.10
above, (ii) any failure by Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Advance on the date
specified in Borrower's written notice, or (iii) any failure by Borrower to pay
a LIBOR Advance on the date for payment specified in Borrower's written notice,
Agent receives payments of principal of, or is subject to a Conversion of a
LIBOR Advance into another Type of Advance, other than on the last day of an
Interest Period relating thereto, Borrower shall, upon demand by Agent, pay to
Agent any amounts required to compensate Agent and Lenders for any losses, costs
or expenses incurred as a result of such payment or Conversion, including,
without limitation, any loss, costs or expenses incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by Agent and
Lenders to fund or maintain such Advances. Such compensation, and the
compensation provided for elsewhere in this Agreement shall include, without
limitation, an amount calculated as follows:

4.11.1   First, Agent shall determine the amount by which (i)
the total amount of interest which would have otherwise accrued hereunder on
each installment of principal so paid or not borrowed, during the period
beginning on the date of such payment or failure to borrow and ending on the
date such installment would have been due (the "Reemployment Period"), exceeds
(ii) the total amount of interest which would accrue, during the Reemployment
Period, on any readily marketable bond or other obligation of the United States
of America designated by Agent in its sole discretion at or about the time of
such payment, such bond or other obligation of the United States of America to
be in an amount equal (as nearly as may be) to the amount of principal so paid
or not borrowed and to have a maturity comparable to the Reemployment Period,
and the interest to accrue thereon to take account of amortization of any
discount from par or accretion of premium above par at which the same is selling
at the time of designation. Each such amount is hereafter referred to as an
"Installment Amount."

4.11.2   Second, each Installment Amount shall be treated as
payable as of the date on which the related principal installment would have
been payable by Borrower had such principal installment not been prepaid or not
borrowed.

4.11.3   Third, the amount to be paid on each such date shall
be the present value of the Installment Amount determined by discounting the
amount thereof from the date on which such Installment Amount is to be treated
as payable, at the same annual interest rate as that payable upon the bond or
other obligation of the United States of America designated as aforesaid by
Agent.

4.12     LATE CHARGE. Without limiting the right of Agent and Lenders
to accelerate the maturity of the Notes or to exercise any other right hereunder
or under the other Loan

34

<PAGE>

Documents, if any payment under the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents is
not received by Agent and Lenders within ten (10) days of the date such payment
is due, without notice or demand, Borrower shall pay to Agent and Lenders a late
charge equal to four percent (4%) of the amount of such payment; provided, that,
in connection with the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes, the late
charge shall not be collected on the aggregate amount of the accelerated
Obligations.

4.13     INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT. Any amount of principal of the Notes
or other amounts due under the Loan Documents which is not paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise and subject to any
applicable notice and/or cure periods contained herein or in any of the Loan
Documents) and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any amount of
interest under the Notes or other Loan Documents which is not paid when due,
subject to any applicable notice and/or cure periods contained herein or in any
of the Loan Documents, shall bear interest, from the date on which such overdue
amount shall have become due and payable by Borrower until payment in full of
the amount then due (whether before or after judgment), payable on demand, at a
rate per annum equal to four percent (4%) plus the Prime Rate, or if such
increased rate of interest may not be collected under applicable law, then at
the maximum rate of interest, if any, which may be collected from Borrower under
applicable law (the "Default Rate").

4.14     INTEREST NOT TO EXCEED MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE AMOUNTS.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Notes, or in any instrument
securing the Notes, the total liability for payments legally regarded as
interest shall not exceed the maximum amounts allowed by applicable law, and any
payment of same in excess of the amount allowed thereby shall, as of the date of
such payment, automatically be deemed to have been applied to the payment of the
principal indebtedness evidenced hereby, or, if same has been fully repaid,
shall be repaid to Borrower. Any notation or record of Agent with respect to
such required application which is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section shall be disregarded for all purposes and shall not be binding upon
either Agent or Lenders.

4.15     UNCONDITIONAL LIABILITY. From time to time, without affecting
the obligation of Borrower or any sureties, guarantors, endorsers, accommodation
parties or other persons liable or to become liable on the Notes to pay the
outstanding principal balance of the Notes and observe the covenants of Borrower
contained herein, without giving notice to or obtaining the consent of Borrower
or any such sureties, guarantors, endorsers, accommodation parties or other
persons, and without liability on the part of Agent and Lenders, Agent and
Lenders may, at the option of Agent and Lenders, grant extensions or
postponements of the time for payment of said outstanding principal balance,
interest or any part thereof, release anyone liable on any of said outstanding
principal balance, accept a renewal of the Notes, release or accept a
substitution of all or any collateral given to secure the Notes, join in any
extension or subordination agreement, agree in writing with Borrower to modify
the rate of interest or terms and time of payment of said outstanding principal
balance or period of amortization of the Notes or change the amount of the
monthly installments payable hereunder, or grant any other indulgence or
forbearance whatsoever. No one or more of such actions shall constitute a
novation.

ARTICLE 5
PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS; CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

5.1      FUNDS FOR PAYMENTS.

5.1.1    All payments of principal, interest, fees and any
other amounts due under the Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents shall
be made to Agent at Agent's Head Office, or at such other location in the
continental United States that Agent may from time to time designate, in each
case not later than 3:00 p.m. (Boston, Massachusetts time) on the day when due
in immediately available funds in lawful money of the United States.

5.1.2    All payments by Borrower under the Notes and under
any of the other Loan Documents shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and
free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or
conditions of any nature now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction
or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein unless
Borrower is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such
obligation to deduct or withhold is imposed upon Borrower with respect to any
amount payable by it under the Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents,
Borrower will pay to Agent, on the date on which such amount is due and payable
under the Notes or under such other Loan Document, such additional amount as
shall be necessary to enable the Lenders to receive the same amount which the
Lenders would have received on such due date had no such obligation been imposed
upon Borrower, subject to the provisions of Sections 5.2 and 5.3 below. Borrower
will deliver promptly to Agent certificates or other valid vouchers for all
taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by
Borrower under the Notes or under such other Loan Document.

5.2      COMPUTATIONS.

5.2.1    All computations of interest hereunder shall be made
by Agent on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days for the actual
number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) elapsed. The
outstanding amount of the Advances as reflected on Agent's records from time to
time shall be presumed to be correct and binding on Borrower unless within
twenty (20) days after receipt by Borrower of any notice from Agent of such
outstanding amount, Borrower notifies Agent to the contrary.

5.2.2    Any change in the rate of interest payable hereunder
resulting from a change in the Prime Rate shall become effective as of the
opening of business on the day on which such change in the Prime Rate becomes
effective.

5.2.3    Each determination of an interest rate by Agent
pursuant to the Notes and this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on
Borrower in the absence of error.

5.2.4    Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day (except as provided in the definition of
Interest Period), and such extension of time shall in such case be included in
the computation of payment of interest.

36

<PAGE>

5.3      ADDITIONAL COSTS. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any present or future applicable law, which expression, as used
herein, includes statutes, rules and regulations thereunder and interpretations
thereof by any competent court or by any Governmental Authority charged with the
administration or the interpretation thereof and requests, directives,
instructions and notices at any time or from time to time hereafter made upon or
otherwise issued to Agent or Lenders by any central bank or other fiscal,
monetary or other authority (whether or not having the force of law), shall:

(a)      subject Agent or Lenders to any tax, levy,
impost, duty, charge, fee, deduction or withholding of any nature with respect
to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Loan or the Advances (other
than taxes based upon or measured by the income or profits of such Agent or
Lenders); or

(b)      materially change the basis of taxation
(except for changes in taxes on income or profits) of payments to Agent or
Lenders of the principal of or the interest on any Advances or any other amounts
payable to Agent or Lenders under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; or

(c)      impose or increase or render applicable
(other than to the extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement)
any special deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other
similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law) against assets
held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans by, or commitments of an
office of Agent or Lenders; or

(d)      impose on Agent or Lenders any other
conditions or requirements with respect to this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the Loan, or any of the Advances;

and the result of any of the foregoing is

(i)      to increase the cost to Agent or
Lenders of making, funding, issuing, renewing, extending or maintaining any of
the Advances or the Loan; or

(ii)     to reduce the amount of principal,
interest or other amount payable to Agent or Lenders hereunder on account of any
of the Advances or the Loan; or

(iii)    to require Agent or Lenders to make
any payment or to forego any interest or other sum payable hereunder, the amount
of which payment or foregone interest or other sum is calculated by reference to
the gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by Agent and Lenders
from Borrower hereunder;

then, and in each such case under the foregoing subparagraphs (i), (ii) and
(iii) of this Section 5.3, Borrower will, upon prompt written demand made by
Agent or Lenders at any time and from time to time and as often as the occasion
therefor may arise, pay to Agent and the Lenders such additional amounts as will
be sufficient to compensate Agent and the Lenders for such additional cost,
reduction, payment or foregone interest or other sum. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Borrower shall not be required to reimburse any Lender organized or
formed under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States for any
such amounts imposed upon such

37

<PAGE>

Lender by virtue of its alien status and not generally imposed on Lenders
organized or formed under the laws of the United States or any state or
jurisdiction thereof.

5.4      CAPITAL ADEQUACY. Agent or any Lender shall promptly notify
Borrower if Agent or Lenders shall have determined that the adoption of any
applicable law, rule, regulation, guideline, directive or request (whether or
not having force of law) regarding capital requirements for banks or bank
holding companies as a whole, or any change therein or in the interpretation or
administration thereof of any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by Agent or Lenders with any of the foregoing imposes or increases a requirement
by Agent or Lenders to allocate capital resources to Agent or Lenders'
commitment to make Advances under this Agreement which has or would have the
effect of reducing the return on Agent and Lenders' capital to a level below
that which Agent and Lenders could have achieved (taking into consideration
Agent and Lenders' then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and
assuming full utilization of Agent and Lenders' capital) but for such
applicability, change, interpretation, administration or compliance, by any
amount deemed in good faith by such Lender or Agent to be material, and which is
not reflected in an increase in the Prime Rate or LIBOR, as the case may be.
Borrower and such Lender shall thereafter attempt to negotiate in good faith an
adjustment to the compensation payable hereunder which will adequately
compensate such Lender for such modification. If Borrower and such Lender are
unable to agree to such adjustment within ninety (90) days of the day on which
Borrower shall receive such written notice, then commencing on the date of such
notice (but not earlier than the effective date of any such applicability,
change, interpretation, administration or compliance), then the fees payable
hereunder shall increase by an amount which will, in the reasonable
determination of such Lender, compensate such Lender for such modification. In
determining the amount of income, such Lender may use any reasonable and
equitable methods of averaging, allocating or attributing such modification
among its customers. The affected Lender shall deliver to Borrower a certificate
demonstrating the calculation of the amount of such increased fees. Borrower
shall be required to pay the increased amount within fifteen (15) days after its
receipt of such certificate.

ARTICLE 6
COLLATERAL SECURITY; GUARANTIES

6.1      COLLATERAL. The Obligations shall be secured by a perfected
first priority lien or security title and security interest in the Collateral,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired, pursuant to the terms of the Security
Documents.

6.2      GUARANTY. Each Subsidiary of Borrower owning a Project (a
"Guarantor") shall execute and deliver to Agent and the Lenders an Unconditional
Guaranty of Payment and Performance (a "Guaranty") in form reasonably acceptable
to Agent, as more particularly described in Section 2.5.2 above. Each Guarantor
shall be jointly and severally liable with Borrower and any other Guarantors for
the repayment of the Obligations.

38

<PAGE>

6.3      RELEASE OF COLLATERAL.

6.3.1    Borrower shall pay to Agent for the benefit of
Lenders one hundred percent (100%) of the Net Sales Proceeds (Actual) of each
sold Unit, cabana or other appurtenance in a Project, which will be applied to
payment of the Outstanding Advances with respect to such Project. Upon
completion of a Project, consummation of the closing of the respective Sales
Contracts with respect to such Project pursuant to the terms thereof and upon
receipt by Agent of the Net Sales Proceeds (Actual) of each such sold Unit,
cabana or other appurtenance thereto in such Project, and provided Agent has not
commenced the exercise of any remedies under this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, Agent shall execute a partial release from the lien of the
applicable Security Instrument for such sold Unit, cabana or other appurtenance
thereto in such Project.

6.3.2    With respect to any Project, at such time as the
portion of the Loan used to construct such Project has been repaid and Agent is
satisfied that:

(i)      the Net Sales Proceeds (Projected)
of Sales Contracts from the remaining Projects in the aggregate are at least one
hundred ten percent (110%) of the aggregate Loan Amount Project Allocations for
the remaining Projects;

(ii)     the aggregate Loan Amount Project
Allocations for the remaining Projects are in balance with the aggregate cost to
complete as provided in the Project Budgets for the remaining Projects (taking
into consideration Required Equity Funds and any additional equity contributions
by Borrower); and

(iii)    no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing;

then Agent shall execute partial releases from the applicable Security
Instrument for the remainder of the Units of such Project for which the total
portion of the Loan, attributable to such Project, has been repaid. Upon the
full and complete release of a Project owned by a Guarantor, Agent and the
Lenders shall release such Guarantor from its Guaranty (but not under its
applicable Indemnity Agreement), assuming such Guarantor does not own any other
Projects at the time of such release.

6.3.3    Notwithstanding the requirement in clause (i) of
Section 6.3.2 above, but subject to the requirements in clauses (ii) and (iii)
of Section 6.3.2, if the Net Sales Proceeds (Projected) of Sales Contracts from
the remaining Projects do not provide the required coverage levels described in
Section 6.3.2, then Borrower may make such cash payment against the outstanding
balance of the Loan as may be necessary to comply with such required coverage
levels.

ARTICLE 7
CERTAIN RIGHTS OF AGENT.

7.1      RIGHT TO RETAIN THE CONSTRUCTION INSPECTOR. Agent shall have
the right to retain, at Borrower's cost and expense, the Construction Inspector

7.1.1    to review and advise the Lenders whether in the
opinion of the Construction Inspector, each of the Project Budgets accurately
reflects all applicable Project Costs;

7.1.2    to review and advise the Lenders whether, in the
opinion of the Construction Inspector, the applicable Plans and Specifications
are satisfactory for the intended purposes thereof;

7.1.3    to make periodic inspections (approximately at the
date of each Draw Request) for the purpose of assuring that construction of the
Improvements to date is in accordance with the applicable Plans and
Specifications and to approve Borrower's then current Draw Request as being
consistent with the applicable Project Budget and Borrower's obligations under
this Agreement, and to advise the Lenders of the anticipated cost of and time
for completion of construction of the Improvements and the adequacy of any
Contingency Reserve;

7.1.4    to review and advise the Lenders on any proposed
change orders or construction change directives requiring Agent's consent; and

7.1.5    to review the Construction Contracts and
subcontracts, for the purpose of providing the Lenders with an opinion as to the
cost of construction to be incurred to complete the Projects, and also for the
purpose of assuring that all such subcontracts are for work required by the
applicable Plans and Specifications to be performed.

The reasonable fees of the Construction Inspector shall be
paid by Borrower forthwith upon billing therefor and the reasonable expenses
incurred by Agent and Lenders on account thereof shall be reimbursed to Agent
and Lenders forthwith upon request therefor, but neither Agent, the Lenders nor
the Construction Inspector shall have any liability to Borrower on account of
the services performed by the Construction Inspector, any neglect or failure on
the part of the Construction Inspector to properly perform its services, or any
approval by the Construction Inspector of construction of the Improvements.
Neither Agent, the Lenders nor the Construction Inspector assumes any obligation
to Borrower or any other Person concerning the quality of construction of the
Improvements or the absence therefrom of defects.

7.2      RIGHT TO OBTAIN APPRAISALS. Agent shall have the right to
obtain, from time to time, at Borrower's cost and expense, updated Appraisals of
the Projects, provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred

expenses associated with one such Appraisal of each of the Projects during any
twenty-four (24) month period, except for any such Appraisal obtained by Agent
in connection with the extension contemplated by Section 4.6 hereof. The
reasonable costs and

40

<PAGE>

expenses incurred by Agent in obtaining such Appraisals shall be paid by
Borrower forthwith upon billing or request by Agent for reimbursement therefor.

7.3      CHARGES AGAINST LOAN CHECKING ACCOUNT. After the occurrence of
an Event of Default, Agent shall have the right, and Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes Agent, to charge the Loan Checking Account held with Agent without
the further approval of Borrower, for any installment of interest due under the
Notes, any reasonable costs or expenses incurred by Agent and Lenders which are
to be paid or reimbursed by Borrower under the terms of this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents (including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, all Construction Inspector, Appraisal and reasonable attorneys'
fees), and all principal and interest and all other sums due to Agent and
Lenders under the Notes, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, all
to the extent that the same are not paid by the respective due dates thereof. If
the balance of the Loan Checking Account is not sufficient to satisfy the
foregoing obligations on the respective due dates thereof and so long as an
Event of Default is continuing, the Agent shall have the right, and Borrower
hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent, to fund Advances into the Loan Checking
Account to satisfy such foregoing obligations.

8.14     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS; GUARANTEED

<PAGE>

8.15.1   With respect to the Projects, to Borrower's
Knowledge, neither Borrower, nor any operations thereon is in violation, or
alleged violation, of any judgment, decree, order, law, license, rule or
regulation pertaining to environmental matters, including, without limitation,
those arising under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as
amended ("CERCLA"), the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986
("SARA"), the Federal Clean Water Act, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Toxic
Substances Control Act, or any state or local statute, regulation, ordinance,
order or decree relating to health, safety or the environment (hereinafter
collectively, as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Environmental
Laws"), which violation could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the environment or result in a Material Adverse Change.

8.15.2   With respect to the Projects, Borrower has not
received notice from any third party including, without limitation, any
Governmental Authority, that (i) it has been identified by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") as a potentially responsible party under
CERCLA with respect to a site listed on the National Priorities List, 40 C.F.R.
Part 300 Appendix B (1986), which could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change; (ii) any hazardous waste, as defined by 42 U.S.C.

valid permits as required under applicable Environmental Laws, which
transporters and facilities have been and are, to the best of Borrower's
Knowledge, operating in compliance with such permits and applicable
Environmental Laws.

8.15.4   No portion of the Projects is or shall be subject to
any applicable environmental clean-up responsibility law or environmental
restrictive transfer law or regulation, by virtue of the transactions set forth
herein and contemplated hereby.

8.15.5   Without limiting the foregoing, to the best of
Borrower's Knowledge, Borrower is operating in compliance with all applicable

Revolving Credit Agreement.

8.17     AVAILABILITY OF UTILITIES. All utility services necessary and
sufficient for the construction, development and operation of each of the
Projects for its intended purposes are presently available (or will be available
by the Completion Date) to the boundaries of the respective Projects through
dedicated public rights of way or through perpetual private easements approved
by the Agent, including, without limitation, water supply, storm and sanitary
sewer, electric and telephone facilities, cable, and drainage. The Security

Projects.

8.18     ACCESS. The rights of way for all roads necessary for the full
utilization of the Improvements for their intended purposes have been completed,
or are in the process of being completed by others (or will be completed by the

Governmental Authority, and the owners of the Projects and the Units to be
constructed thereon either have direct access to a public road or a
non-exclusive access easement over one or more private roads which are
contiguous and have access to a public road. All curb cuts and driveways shown
on the Plans and Specifications are existing, have been fully approved by the

and are in full force and effect. Borrower has no reason to believe that any of
the Project Approvals not heretofore obtained by Borrower will not be obtained
by Borrower in the ordinary course following completion of the construction of
the Improvements in accordance with the Plans and Specifications. To the best of
Borrower's Knowledge, no Project Approvals will terminate, or become void or
voidable or terminable, upon any sale, transfer or other disposition of the
Projects, including any transfer pursuant to a foreclosure sale under any
Security Instrument; provided, however, that a subsequent owner may be required

force and effect and Borrower and the Contractors are in compliance with their
respective obligations under the Construction Contracts in all materials

and effect and Borrower and the Architects are in compliance with their
respective obligations under the Architects' Contracts in all material respects.

8.24     OTHER CONTRACTS. Other than Permitted Liens, the Construction
Contracts (and subcontracts thereunder), the Architects' Contracts and
agreements with landscape architects, designers, engineers, or other
professionals providing services in connection with the construction of the
Projects, Borrower has not made any contract or arrangement of any kind or type
whatsoever (whether oral or written, formal or informal), the performance of
which by the other party thereto could give rise to a lien or encumbrance on the
Projects.

8.25     REAL PROPERTY TAXES; SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. There are no unpaid
or outstanding real estate or other taxes or assessments on or against the
Projects or any part thereof which are payable by Borrower (except only real
estate taxes, community development district assessments and other installments
of assessments not yet due and payable). Borrower has delivered to Agent true
and correct copies of real estate tax bills for the Projects for the past fiscal
tax year. No abatement proceedings are pending with reference to any real estate
taxes assessed against the Projects.

8.26     VIOLATIONS. Borrower has not received written notices of, nor
has any Knowledge of, any violations of any applicable Requirements or Project
Approvals which have not been corrected or are in the process of being corrected
in the manner specified in such notice.

designee with true and complete sets of the Plans and Specifications. After
thorough independent investigation

46

<PAGE>

and consultation with all appropriate Governmental Authorities and with the
Architects and Contractors, to the best of Borrower's Knowledge and belief, the
Plans and Specifications so furnished to Agent comply with all Requirements, all
Project Approvals, and all restrictions, covenants and easements affecting the
Projects, and have been approved by the Contractors, the Architects, and such
Governmental Authorities as are required for construction of the Improvements
(except for the Project Approvals set forth in Part XII of the Project Schedules
attached hereto as Exhibit A).

8.28     PROJECT BUDGETS. Subject to adjustment as permitted in Section
2.10 above, the Project Budgets accurately reflect all Project Costs.

8.29     FEASIBILITY. Each of the Construction Schedules and the Pro
Forma Draw Schedules is realistic and feasible.

8.30     SALES CONTRACTS; ESCROW DEPOSITS. Borrower has entered into
the Sales Contracts with bona fide third party purchasers (except for Insider
Sales) as set forth in Part X of the Project Schedules attached hereto as
Exhibit A. Such Sales Contracts are in full force and effect (any rescission
periods having expired) and Borrower and the purchasers thereunder are all in
full compliance with their respective obligations under such Sales Contracts.
Borrower has not received any notice of default of any purchaser or Borrower,
under any of the Sales Contracts. Borrower makes the additional representations
and warranties regarding the Sales Contracts and Escrow Deposits set out in Part
XIV of the Project Schedules attached hereto as Exhibit A.

8.31     DIVISION OF FLORIDA LAND SALES, CONDOMINIUMS AND MOBILE HOMES
COMPLIANCE.'Except for any minor technical deficiencies which Borrower routinely
cures in the ordinary course of business, Borrower and each of the Projects are
in compliance with the Requirements of the Division of Florida Land Sales,
Condominiums and Mobile Homes, the Condominium Act, the Florida Uniform Land
Sales Practices Law (or similar Requirements of any other state in which a
Project is located) and the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act.

8.32     COMMON ENTERPRISE AND CONSIDERATION. Borrower and Guarantor
are collectively engaged in a common enterprise for the furtherance of the Core
Businesses. Accordingly, Borrower and Guarantor have received good and adequate
consideration for entering into this Agreement and the Loan Documents.
Furthermore, Borrower and Guarantor agree that an advance to Borrower that is
subsequently disbursed by Borrower to Guarantor for use by such entity shall
benefit all of Borrower and Guarantor, even if the advance is based upon a
Borrowing Base which includes assets of a Person that does not receive the
disbursement from Borrower. Borrower and Guarantor agree that they will each
receive good and adequate benefit from this common arrangement given the common
enterprise of all of the foregoing as set forth above.

not constitute a waiver of Agent and Lender's right to require compliance with
this Section 9.3.

purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as such term is defined in

the Loan Amount Project Allocation, together with the undisbursed portion of the
Escrow Deposits which can be utilized for construction, plus additional equity
or any other sums previously deposited by Borrower with Agent in connection with
the Loan, is or will be insufficient to fully complete and equip the
Improvements substantially in accordance with the Plans and Specifications, to
operate and carry each of such Projects covered by the Security Instruments at
such time, after completion of the Improvements until payment in full of the
Loan by Borrower, to pay all other Project Costs, to pay all interest accrued or
to accrue on the Loan during the term of the Loan from and after the date
hereof, and to pay all other sums due or to become due under the Loan Documents
(or as to any budget category or line item in the Project Budgets, but subject
to the provisions of Section 2.10 hereof, if the undisbursed funds for such
category or line item are or will be insufficient to fully pay for the costs
attributed to such budget category or line item), regardless of how such
condition may

53

<PAGE>

be caused, then Borrower will, within seven (7) days after written notice of
such determination from Agent, deposit into a non-interest bearing loan checking
account set up with Agent, or following the occurrence of an Event of Default,
into the Loan Checking Account, such sums of money in cash as the Lenders may
require, in an amount sufficient to remedy the condition described in such
notice, and sufficient to pay any liens for labor and materials alleged to be
due and payable at that time in connection with the Improvements, and, at
Agent's option, no further Advances of the Loan shall be made by the Lenders
until the provisions of this Section 9.15 have been fully complied with. All
such deposited sums shall stand as additional security for the Obligations and
shall be disbursed by the Lenders in the same manner as Advances under this
Agreement before any further Advances of the Loan proceeds shall be made.

commercially reasonable steps within the power of Borrower to consummate the
closing of the sale of Units to such purchasers and upon such terms and

least three (3) Business Days prior written notice before the date for the
consummation of the closing of such sales. Borrower will make, or cause to be
made, such amendments, modifications or additions thereto as may be required by
any Requirements or as may be necessary to qualify for any exceptions under any
applicable Requirement as requested by Agent. The Net Sales Proceeds (Actual)

furnished labor or material to the Projects or any part thereof, together with
affidavits, or other evidence satisfactory to Agent, showing that such parties

waiver.

13.2     TERMINATION OF COMMITMENT AND ACCELERATION.

occur and not be cured within the applicable cure period, if any, Agent may, and
shall if directed by the Required

69

<PAGE>

Lenders, by notice to Borrower declare Lenders' obligations to make Advances
hereunder to be terminated, whereupon the same shall terminate and Agent and
Lenders shall be relieved of all obligations to make Advances to Borrower,
and/or declare all unpaid principal of and accrued interest on the Notes,
together with all other amounts owing under the Loan Documents, to be
immediately due and payable, without further notice or demand, whereupon same
shall become and be immediately due and payable, anything in the Loan Documents
to the contrary notwithstanding, and without presentment, protest, demand or
other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower;
provided that if any one or more of the Events of Default specified in Section
13.1.15 or Section 13.1.16 hereof shall occur with respect to Borrower, the
Lenders' obligations to make Advances hereunder automatically shall so terminate
and all unpaid principal of and accrued interest on the Notes, together with all
other amounts owing under the Loan Documents, automatically shall become and be
immediately so due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part
of Agent or Lenders. Failure to exercise such option shall not constitute a
waiver of the right to exercise such option in the future upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default.

13.2.2   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document to the contrary, any reference in this Agreement or in any
other Loan Document that an "Event of Default is continuing" or to "the
continuance of an Event of Default" or any similar phrase shall not create or be
deemed to create any right on the part of the Borrower, Guarantor or any other
party to cure any default following the expiration of any applicable grace or
notice and cure period.

13.3     COMPLETION OF PROJECTS. If any one or more of the Events of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and whether or not Agent shall
have terminated Lenders' obligations to make Advances and accelerated the
maturity of the Loan pursuant to Section 13.2, Agent, if the construction of the
Improvements has not been fully completed, may cause the Projects to be
completed and may enter upon the Land and construct, equip and complete the
Projects in accordance with the Plans and Specifications, with such changes
therein as Agent may, from time to time, and in its sole discretion, deem
appropriate. In connection with any construction of the Projects undertaken by
Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 13.3, Agent may:

13.3.1   use any funds of Borrower which may be held by Agent
as security or in escrow in connection with this Loan to the extent such are
allowed to be used under applicable condominium laws, and any funds remaining
unadvanced under the Loan;

13.3.2   employ existing contractors, subcontractors, agents,
architects, engineers, and the like, or terminate the same and employ others;

13.3.3   employ security watchmen to protect the Projects;

13.3.4   make such additions, changes and corrections in the
Plans and Specifications as shall, in the judgment of Agent, be necessary or
desirable;

13.3.5   take over and use any and all Personal Property
contracted for or purchased by Borrower, if appropriate, or dispose of the same
as Agent sees fit;

70

<PAGE>

13.3.6   execute all applications and certificates on behalf
of Borrower which may be required by any Governmental Authority or Requirements
or contract documents or agreements;

13.3.7   pay, settle or compromise all existing or future
bills and claims which are or may be liens against the Projects, or may be
necessary for the completion of the Improvements or the clearance of title to
the Projects;

13.3.8   complete the marketing of Units, enter into Sales
Contracts, and modify or amend existing Sales Contracts, all as Agent shall deem
to be necessary or desirable;

13.3.9   prosecute and defend all actions and proceedings in
connection with the construction of the Improvements or in any other way
affecting the Land or the Improvements and take such action and require such
performance as Agent deems necessary under any Payment and Performance Bonds;
and

13.3.10  take such action hereunder, or refrain from acting
hereunder, as Agent may, in its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time
determine, and without any limitation whatsoever, to carry out the intent of
this Section 13.3.

Borrower shall be liable to Agent and Lenders for all
reasonable costs paid or incurred for the construction, equipping and completion
of the Projects, whether the same shall be paid or incurred pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 13.3 or otherwise, and all payments made or
liabilities incurred by Agent and Lenders hereunder of any kind whatsoever shall
be deemed Advances made to Borrower under this Agreement and shall be secured by
the Security Instruments and the other Security Documents. To the extent that
any reasonable costs so paid or incurred by Agent or Lenders, together with all
other Advances made by the Lenders hereunder, exceed the Loan Amount, the amount
of such excess costs shall be added to the Loan Amount, and Borrower's
obligation to repay the same, together with interest thereon at the Default
Rate, shall be deemed to be evidenced by this Agreement and secured by the
Security Instruments and the other Security Documents. In the event Agent takes
possession of the Projects and assumes control of such construction as
aforesaid, it shall not be obligated to continue such construction longer than
it shall see fit and may thereafter, at any time, change any course of action
undertaken by it or abandon such construction and decline to make further
payments for the account of Borrower whether or not the Projects shall have been
completed. For the purpose of this Section 13.3, the construction, equipping and
completion of the Projects shall be deemed to include any action necessary to
cure any Event of Default by Borrower under any of the terms and provisions of
any of the Loan Documents.

13.4     OTHER REMEDIES. If any one or more of the Events of Default
shall have occurred, and whether or not Agent shall have terminated Lenders'
obligations to make Advances or accelerated the maturity of the Loan pursuant to
Section 13.2 hereof, Agent may proceed to protect and enforce its and the
Lenders' rights and remedies under this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other
Loan Documents by suit in equity, action at law or other appropriate proceeding,
whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any instrument pursuant to which
the Obligations are evidenced, including as permitted by applicable law the
obtaining of the ex-

71

<PAGE>

parte appointment of a receiver, and, if any amount owed to the Lenders shall
have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the payment
thereof or any other legal or equitable right of Agent and Lenders. No remedy
conferred upon Agent, the Lenders or the holder of the Notes in this Agreement
or in any of the other Loan Documents is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to
every other remedy given hereunder or thereunder or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Obligations
shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

13.5     DISTRIBUTION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS. In the event that,
following the occurrence or during the continuance of any Event of Default,
Agent receives any monies in connection with the enforcement of any the Security
Documents, or otherwise with respect to the realization upon any of the
Collateral, such monies shall be distributed for application as follows:

13.5.1   First, to the payment of, or (as the case may be) the
reimbursement of the Lenders for or in respect of all reasonable costs,
expenses, disbursements and losses which shall have been incurred or sustained
by Agent and Lenders in connection with the collection of such monies by Agent
and Lenders, for the exercise, protection or enforcement by the Lenders of all
or any of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of Agent and Lenders under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or in respect of the
Collateral or in support of any provision of adequate indemnity to Agent and
Lenders against any taxes or liens which by law shall have, or may have,
priority over the rights of Agent and Lenders to such monies, provided, however,
that any distribution to Agent and Lenders under this Section 13.5.1, shall be
first made to Agent for costs incurred by Agent on behalf of Lenders, then pro
rata to each Lender based on its respective Loan Percentage;

13.5.2   Second, to all other Obligations in such order or
preference as Agent may determine; provided, however, that Agent may in its
discretion make proper allowance to take into account any Obligations not then
due and payable, and provided, however, that any distribution to the Lenders
shall be made pro rata to each Lender based on its respective Loan Percentage;

13.5.3   Third, upon payment and satisfaction in full or other
provisions for payment in full satisfactory to Agent and Lenders of all of the
Obligations, to the payment of any obligations required to be paid pursuant to
revised Section 9-504(1)(c) of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of
Georgia, provided that all distributions to the Lenders shall be made pro rata
to each Lender based on its respective Loan Percentage; and

13.5.4   Fourth, the excess, if any, shall be returned to
Borrower or to such other Persons as are entitled thereto.

13.6     POWER OF ATTORNEY. For the purposes of carrying out the
provisions and exercising the rights, remedies, powers and privileges granted by
or referred to in this Article 13, Borrower hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Agent its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power of
substitution, to execute, acknowledge and deliver any instruments and do and
perform any acts which are referred to in this Article 13, in the name and on
behalf of Borrower.

72

<PAGE>

The power vested in such attorney-in-fact is, and shall be deemed to be, coupled
with an interest and irrevocable.

13.7     WAIVERS. Except to the extent required by the provisions
hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby waives to the
extent not prohibited by applicable law all presentments, demands for
performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, and
notices of dishonor, any requirement of diligence or promptness on Agent's and
Lenders' part in the enforcement of their rights (but not fulfillment of its
obligations) under the provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, and any and all notices of every kind and description which may be
required to be given by any statute or rule of law and any defense of any kind
which Borrower may now or hereafter have with respect to its liability under
this Agreement, the Notes, or under any of the other Loan Documents.

ARTICLE 14
SETOFF

Regardless of the adequacy of any Collateral, but subject to
the provisions of Section 20.7 below, during the continuance of any Event of
Default, any deposits (general or specific, time or demand, provisional or
final, regardless of currency, maturity, or the branch of Agent where such
deposits are held) or other sums credited by or due from Agent to Borrower and
any securities or other property of Borrower in the possession of Agent may be
applied to or set off against the payment of the Obligations and any and all
other liabilities, direct, or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become
due, now existing or hereafter arising, of Borrower to Agent and Lenders.

shall be specifically excluded from the foregoing indemnification any claims,
actions, suits, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses arising from disputes
among Lenders with respect to the Loans or the Loan Documents. In the event that
any such claims, actions, suits, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses
involve both a dispute among Lenders and other matters covered by this
indemnification provision, Agent shall make a reasonable good faith allocation
of all losses, damages and expenses incurred between Lenders' dispute and the
other matters covered by this indemnification provision, which allocation by
Agent shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto.

ARTICLE 16
INDEMNIFICATION

Except to the extent of liability arising from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or any Lender (and their respective
officers, directors and employees), Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Agent and Lenders (and their respective officers, directors and
employees) from and against any and all claims, actions and suits, whether
groundless or otherwise, and from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages and expenses of every nature and character arising out of this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby including, without limitation:

(a)      any brokerage, leasing, finders or similar
fees;

(b)      any disbursement of the proceeds of any of
the Advances;

74

<PAGE>

(d)      any actual or proposed use by Borrower of
the proceeds of any of the Advances;

(e)      any actual or alleged violation of any
Requirements or Project Approvals;

(f)      Borrower entering into or performing this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; and

injury or damage to property); provided, that indemnification obligations
hereunder shall not apply to any costs incurred by or imposed upon Agent or the
Lenders which arise solely as a consequence of a condition coming into existence
on any Project subsequent to the time Agent or its nominee takes both title to
such Project by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and possession of
such Project, unless such costs are incurred in connection with an event related
to a condition existing at such Project prior to or at the time of transfer of
title and possession to Agent or its nominee through such foreclosure or deed in
lieu of foreclosure; provided, however, Borrower shall bear the burden of proof
that the events (i) occurred subsequent to the transfer of title and possession
and (ii) did not occur as a result of any action of Borrower;

in each case including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any such investigation,
litigation or other proceeding relating thereto. In litigation, or the
preparation therefor, Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to select its own
counsel and, in addition to the foregoing indemnity, Borrower agrees to pay
promptly the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The obligations of
Borrower under this Article 16 shall survive the repayment of the Loan, or if
earlier, the foreclosure of any Security Instrument or any deed given in lieu of
foreclosure, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as the
possibility of such claim, action or suit exists. If, and to the extent that the
obligations of Borrower under this Article 16 are unenforceable for any reason,
Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment in
satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under applicable law.
There shall be specifically excluded from the foregoing indemnification any
claims, actions, suits, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses arising from
disputes among Lenders with respect to the Loans or the Loan Documents. In the
event that any such claims, actions, suits, liabilities, losses, damages and
expenses involve both a dispute among Lenders and other matters covered by this
indemnification provision, Agent shall make a reasonable good faith allocation
of all losses, damages and expenses incurred between Lenders' dispute and the
other matters covered by this indemnification provision, which allocation by
Agent shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto.

ARTICLE 17

17.1     EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. Agent may exercise its powers and
execute its duties by or through employees or agents and shall be entitled to
take, and to rely on, advice of counsel

75

<PAGE>

concerning all matters pertaining to its rights and duties under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents. Borrower shall be permitted to rely on the
authority of the Agent to act for the Banks and shall have no obligation to
inquire into the extent of such authority. Agent may utilize the services of
such Persons as Agent in its sole discretion may reasonably determine, and all
reasonable fees and expenses of any such Persons shall be paid by Borrower in
accordance with Article 15 hereof. Agent may from time to time appoint such
Persons as it desires to act on its behalf under this Agreement in such
capacities and with such powers as it may specify. Agent shall promptly notify
Borrower of the appointment of any such Person and the capacity in which they
are authorized to act on behalf of Agent. Agent may, upon giving written notice
to Borrower, revoke the appointment of any such Person.

17.2     NO LIABILITY. Neither Agent nor any of its shareholders,
directors, officers or employees nor any other Person assisting them in their
duties nor any agent or employee thereof, shall be liable for any waiver,
consent or approval given or any action taken, or omitted to be taken, in good
faith by it or them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in
connection herewith or therewith, or be responsible for the consequences of any
oversight or error of judgment whatsoever except as set forth in the first
sentence of Section 20.9 hereof.

17.3     REMOVAL OF AGENT. Provided no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, Borrower shall have the right to replace the Agent in its
capacity as "Agent" under this Agreement (without affecting such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement as "Lender") on the following terms and
conditions:

(a)      Borrower may appoint any "titled" Lender
appearing on the cover page or preamble of this Agreement as Agent without the
approval of the other Lenders, but the appointment of any other Lender as Agent
must be approved by a vote of the Majority Lenders.

(b)      Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the removed Agent, and the removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder. After the removal of any Agent as "Agent" pursuant to
this Section 17.3, the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent. The removed Agent shall
cooperate with the successor Agent in the turning over of all records,
information and other administrative matters regarding the Loan.

ARTICLE 18
RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

18.1     NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY. All conditions to the performance
of the obligations of Agent and Lenders under this Agreement, including the
obligation to make Advances, are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit
of Agent, Lenders and Borrower and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Agent and Lenders will refuse to make Advances in the
absence of strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall,
under any circumstances, be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any
and all of which may be

76

<PAGE>

freely waived in whole or in part by Agent at any time if in its sole discretion
it deems it desirable to do so. In particular, Agent and Lenders make no
representations and assume no obligations as to third parties concerning the
quality of the construction by Borrower of the Improvements or the absence
therefrom of defects.

18.2     SUBORDINATION OF THIRD-PARTY CONTRACT. The rights of all
contractors, subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, laborers, suppliers and
materialmen performing any work in connection with the Improvements, or
furnishing any services, labor or materials thereto or to the Projects, shall be
subordinate and inferior to the Security Instruments and the rights of Agent and
Lenders. Agent and Lenders shall not be liable to materialmen, contractors,
subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, laborers, suppliers or others for goods or
services delivered by them in or upon the Projects or employed in the
construction of the Improvements, or for any debts or claims accruing to any of
said parties against Borrower or against the Projects, and it is distinctly
understood and agreed that there is no contractual relation, either express or
implied, between Agent and Lenders and any materialmen, contractors,
subcontractors, sub-subcontractors, craftsmen, suppliers, laborers or any person
supplying any work, labor or material. Borrower is not, nor shall be, an agent
of Agent or Lenders for any purpose, nor shall Agent or Lenders be an agent of
Borrower for any purpose, except, as to both, as may be specifically set forth
herein. It is specifically understood and agreed that no party shall be a third
party beneficiary of the terms, covenants and agreements set forth in the Loan
Documents, except and unless it is specifically provided herein that any
provision shall operate or inure to the use and benefit of a particular Person.
No purchaser under any of the Sales Contracts and no contractor, subcontractor,
sub-subcontractor or materialman, laborer or supplier shall have any rights
hereunder against Agent or Lenders, or be entitled to have any benefit of or the
protection of any of the terms, covenants and agreements herein contained.

ARTICLE 19
SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS

All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made
herein, in the Notes, in any of the other Loan Documents or in any documents or
other papers delivered by or on behalf of Borrower or any of them pursuant
hereto and thereto shall be deemed to have been relied upon by Agent, the
Lenders, their successors and assigns, notwithstanding any investigation
heretofore or hereafter made by any of them, and shall survive the making by the
Lenders of the Advances, as herein contemplated, and shall continue in full
force and effect so long as any amount due under this Agreement or the Notes or
any of the other Loan Documents remains outstanding or the Lenders have any
obligation to make any Advances. All statements contained in any certificate or
other paper delivered to Agent or Lenders at any time by or on behalf of
Borrower or any of them pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby shall constitute representations and warranties by Borrower
or any of them hereunder.

ARTICLE 20
AGENT AND LENDERS RELATIONSHIP

The provisions of this Article 20 are included in the
Agreement to govern the relationship among the Lenders and Agent. Borrower
hereby acknowledges and agrees (i) to the

77

<PAGE>

foregoing sentence; (ii) that, except with respect to certain rights of Borrower
set forth in Sections 20.13.1, 20.14.4, 20.24 and 20.27 and provisions regarding
Advances to Borrower set forth in Sections 20.3.1 and 20.3.2, Borrower is not a
beneficiary of any of the covenants, conditions, rights and obligations set
forth in this Article 20; and (iii) that without any consent, approval or
agreement from Borrower and without, in any way, changing or modifying any of
the other terms and provisions of this Agreement, Agent and Lenders, from time
to time, may modify and amend this Article 20 either by an amendment to this
Agreement or by another document that does not include Borrower as a signatory
thereto, except that any modification or amendment of the rights of Borrower
described in Sections 20.3.1, 20.3.2, 20.13.1, 20.14.4, 20.24 or 20.27 shall
require the Borrower's prior written consent.

20.1     APPOINTMENT. Subject to the terms hereof, the Lenders hereby
appoint Agent as their agent to administer and enforce the obligations of
Borrower under the Loan, the Agreement, and the Loan Documents, and authorize
Agent to take such actions on Lenders' behalf as are delegated to Agent by the
terms of this Article 20 or any of the Loan Documents, together with such powers
as are reasonably incidental to Agent's authority. Agent agrees to perform in
such capacity upon the express conditions contained in this Article 20. Subject
to the terms of this Article 20, and except with regard to the rights and powers
expressly granted to Agent, Lenders hereby agree to perform the obligations and
duties of the "lender", "bank", "mortgagee", "secured party" or other similar
designation for a Lender under this Agreement. No Lender shall have any priority
of ownership or interest over the other in the Loan, Loan Documents or the
Collateral. The relationship between Agent and the Lenders is and shall be that
of agent and principal only, and nothing contained in this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents shall be construed to constitute Agent as a trustee or
fiduciary for any Lender.

20.2     POWERS. Agent shall have and may exercise such powers as are
available to the Lenders under the Loan Documents, subject to the provisions of
this Article 20, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental to
Agent's authority. Lenders hereby authorize Agent to act on behalf of Lenders to
exercise such powers as are reasonably incidental to Agent's exercise of its
rights hereunder and under the Loan Documents, including the receipt of all
payments of principal, interest, fees and expenses reimbursed or payable under
or in connection with the Loan and/or the Loan Documents.

20.3     ADVANCES.

20.3.1   Subject to the terms hereof, each Lender shall make
its Loan Percentage of the Advances called for under this Agreement and of all
Advances required by the Lenders under the Loan Documents to preserve or protect
the Property or the continued perfection and priority of Agent's security title
and lien on the Property or to enforce Agent's rights under the Loan Documents.
Agent shall notify Lenders, by telephone, facsimile or electronic email
transmission, of each Advance and the date on which such deposit is required to
be made, and shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each Lender a complete
copy of Borrower's Requisition for Advance and all supporting documentation no
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the scheduled date of the Advance.

20.3.2   Lenders shall deposit by wire transfer their
respective Loan Percentage of each Loan Advance in the loan account designated
by Agent, on the date of, and not later than

78

<PAGE>

12:00 noon (Boston, Massachusetts time) on the scheduled date of the Advance.
Interest shall accrue from the date the same is deposited with Agent. Upon such
deposit by each Lender, Agent shall deliver to each Lender a certificate as to
such Advance. Agent will disburse funds so deposited by Lenders for the purposes
and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

20.3.3   Unless Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to 11:00 a.m. (Boston, Massachusetts time) on the date of any Advance that
such Lender will not make available to Agent such Lender's ratable portion of
such Advance, Agent may assume that such Lender has made or will make such
portion available to Agent on the date of such Advance and Agent may, in its
sole discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower
on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to Agent, such Lender agrees to
repay to Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to
Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to Agent, (i) for the first two
(2) Business Days, at the rate on overnight Federal funds transactions with
members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers, as
published for such day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and (ii)
thereafter, at the interest rate then in effect with respect to such Advance. If
such Lender shall repay to Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so
repaid shall constitute such Lender's portion of the applicable Advance for
purposes of this Agreement, and if both such Lender and Borrower shall pay and
repay such corresponding amount, Agent shall promptly relend to Borrower such
corresponding amount. If such Lender does not repay such corresponding amount
immediately upon Agent's demand therefor, Agent shall notify Borrower, and
Borrower shall immediately repay such corresponding amount to Agent. The failure
of any Lender to fund its portion of any Advance shall not relieve any other
Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to fund its respective portion of
the Advance on the date of such borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible
for any such failure of any other Lender and no Lender shall be required to fund
any amounts in excess of its Commitment.

20.4     PAYMENTS. Agent will receive all payments made by Borrower and
by others on account of principal, interest, expenses, and fees, holding each
Lender's share thereof in trust (but subject to the express provisions of this
Agreement and subject to Agent's rights of setoff provided herein) for the
benefit of such Lender. Whenever Agent shall receive a payment of principal,
interest, late charges, yield maintenance charges, or the extension fee
contemplated by Section 4.6.9 hereof, if any, Agent agrees to promptly
distribute to each Lender, by federal reserve wire transfer to each Lender in
accordance with the wire instructions furnished to Agent by such Lender, in
lawful money of the United States of America and in the kind of funds so
received, an amount equal to such Lender's Loan Percentage thereof. If any such
payment received by Agent or any such application made by Agent is rescinded or
must otherwise be returned or released by Agent, upon notice from Agent, each
Lender shall promptly pay to Agent the amount such Lender received of the amount
to be returned. In no event shall Agent be required to fund any amounts
hereunder on any day which is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday on which
banking institutions in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are authorized by law
to close. Without limitation of each Lender's obligation to pay the Expenses as
defined in Section 20.12 hereof, it is agreed that Agent shall be entitled to
deduct from each Lender's interest in such payments (before remitting any
remaining amount of such payments to such Lender) such Lender's pro rata share
of the Expenses (as hereinafter defined), if any, which has not been paid

79

<PAGE>

by such Lender to Agent within thirty (30) days after written request for
payment has been made by Agent, without prejudice to such Lender's rights to
recover the amount so deducted if not in fact owed by such Lender.

20.5     SHARING.

20.5.1   If any Lender shall obtain any repayment (whether
voluntary or involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, off-set,
banker's lien, counterclaim, or under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code
or otherwise) on account of the Loan to Borrower in excess of that Lender's Loan
Percentage of payments to which it is entitled, such Lender agrees that it shall
share such excess amount pro rata with the other Lenders in accordance with
their Loan Percentage.

20.5.2   Agent shall promptly forward to each Lender any
written financial information, appraisals and sales information, and any other
material information specifically relating to the Projects that it shall receive
from Borrower in connection with the Loan to the extent the same are not
delivered directly to each Lender by Borrower. Upon written request from any
Lender, but no more often than monthly, Agent shall provide to each Lender
information with respect to the status of principal and interest payments, lien
status and any written factual information in the possession of Agent bearing on
the credit worthiness of Borrower; provided, however, that Agent shall not be
obligated to provide Lenders with any confidential information about Borrower
set forth in reports of bank examiners from regulatory authorities having
jurisdiction over Agent. Agent shall not be required to provide any particular
information more than one time and subsequent requests by Lenders shall only be
deemed to include information obtained by Agent from and after the date of the
last submission by Agent. All reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Agent incident to the submission of information so specially requested by a
Lender shall be deemed an "Expense" as defined in Section 20.12 below. If any
Lender shall receive any document or other delivery from Borrower in connection
with the Loan that the Lender actually knows has not also been delivered to
Agent, the Lender shall deliver a copy thereof to Agent.

20.6     LOAN DOCUMENTS AND COLLATERAL. Agent shall hold the Loan
Documents, the Collateral and security therefor and any other documents or
instruments delivered by Borrower in connection with the Loan (but only to the
extent that Agent is the holder thereof) and all payments or proceeds received
in connection therewith for the undivided benefit and protection of the Lenders
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each Lender shall
receive a copy of each Loan Document.

20.7     NO INTEREST. No Lender shall have any interest in any property
taken as security for any other loans or extensions of credit made to or for
Borrower by any other Lender or in any property in such other Lender's
possession or control or in any deposit held or other indebtedness owing by any
other Lender which may be or become collateral for or otherwise available for
payment of any other loan by reason of the general description of a secured
obligation contained in any security instrument or other agreement or instrument
held by such other Lender by reason of the right of setoff, counterclaim,
off-set, banker's lien or under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, except
that if such property, deposit, indebtedness or the proceeds thereof shall be
applied in reduction of amounts outstanding under this Loan, then the

80

<PAGE>

Lenders shall be entitled to their Loan Percentage of such application as set
forth above. Each Lender and their respective parents, subsidiaries, and
Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustees under
indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any
Affiliate of Borrower and any Person which may do business with Borrower, all as
if the Lenders were not lenders under the Loan and without any duty to account
therefor to the other Lenders.

20.8     STANDARD OF CARE. Agent shall service the Loan in accordance
with its customary practices in servicing similar loans for its own account, and
as provided in this Agreement. Agent shall not be required to take any action
which violates the terms of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or
violates any laws, rules, court orders and decisions, ordinances, regulations,
statutes, requirements, codes and executive orders, now existing or hereafter
created.

20.9     DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS. No Lender (nor Agent in its capacity
as Agent) nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
parents or Subsidiaries shall be liable to the other Lenders for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful or illegal misconduct. Without limitation of the
generality of the foregoing, among the Lenders, each Lender (including Agent in
its capacity as Agent)

(a)      may treat the others as the holder of its
Loan Percentage of the Loan unless and until it receives written notice of the
assignment thereof signed by such assignor and the written agreement of the
assignee that such assignee is bound by this Agreement as it would have been if
it had been an original lender party to this Agreement, in each case in a form
satisfactory to the other Lenders and made in compliance with the provisions of
Section 20.13 hereof;

(b)      shall incur no liability under or in respect
of this Agreement, the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon
any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by
telecopy, telegram, cable or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or
sent by the proper party or parties or by acting upon any statement made by the
other Lender or deemed to be made by such other Lender;

(c)      shall make no warranty or representation to
the other Lenders and shall not be responsible to the other Lenders for any
statements, warranties or representations (whether written or oral) made by
Borrower in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document;

(d)      shall not have any duty, beyond its usual
and customary loan administration and servicing procedures, to ascertain or to
inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document on the part of Borrower
or to inspect the books and records of Borrower;

(e)      shall not be responsible to the other
Lenders for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
perfection, priority, condition, sufficiency or value

81

<PAGE>

of the Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any Collateral provided
thereunder (including the Projects), or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; and

(f)      shall not be responsible for the financial
condition or credit worthiness of Borrower.

20.10    NOTICE OF EVENT OF DEFAULT, EXERCISE OF REMEDIES, FORECLOSURE,
ETC.

20.10.1  In the event that Agent or any Lender acquires Actual
Knowledge (as herein defined) of the occurrence of an Event of Default, Agent or
the Lender acquiring such knowledge will notify the other Lenders thereof as
soon as is reasonably practical. Thereafter, Agent shall provide the Lenders
with prior written notice of any actions or omissions proposed to be taken by
Agent with respect thereto unless the giving of such notice is impractical for
reasons of safety or preservation of collateral. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Actual Knowledge" shall mean actual knowledge of any officer of Agent or any
Lender having primary, day-to-day responsibility for administration of the Loan.

20.10.2  Upon the giving of any notice required under Section
20.10.1 above, Agent shall take such action or actions, assert such rights,
exercise such remedies and/or waive such Event(s) of Default or refrain from
taking such actions with respect thereto as allowed hereunder, but only as
agreed to in writing by the Required Lenders, which can include Agent, in its
capacity as a Lender. In the event that the Required Lenders agree on the
foregoing within ten (10) Business Days after the date (the "Notice Date") of
Lenders' receipt of Agent's recommendations, Agent may promptly thereafter
exercise such action or omission as proposed including, without limitation,
acceleration of the Loan and/or foreclosure of any Security Instrument, as Agent
reasonably determines necessary, to protect and enforce the interests and rights
of the Lenders thereunder and the Lenders will cooperate fully in connection
therewith. Agent shall promptly thereafter provide written notice to the Lenders
of the action taken or to be taken by Agent. In particular, the Lenders, upon
consent of the Required Lenders, or Agent, if there is no such consent as set
forth above and Agent reasonably determines payment is in best interest of all
the Lenders, may pay taxes and insurance premiums, spend money for maintenance,
repairs, capital improvements, tenant improvements or other expenses which may
be necessary to be incurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Agent's
decision to expend monies to complete construction of the Improvements pursuant
to the provisions of this Agreement shall require consent of the Required
Lenders (including Agent, in its capacity as a Lender). Each Lender shall,
within thirty (30) days of request therefor, pay to Agent in the manner set
forth in Section 20.12 below, its Loan Percentage of the costs incurred by Agent
in taking any such actions hereunder to the extent that such costs shall not be
promptly reimbursed to Agent by Borrower or out of the Collateral and such costs
shall be deemed an "Expense" as defined under Section 20.12 of this Agreement.

When Agent is authorized or permitted to take any action under
this Section 20.10.2 and such action requires signature by the Lenders on any
documents, writings or pleadings in order to carry out such action, then each
Lender shall either (i) execute and return such documents, writings or pleadings
to Agent within ten (10) Business Days following receipt thereof by such Lender
or (ii) deliver to Agent within such period a written response detailing
specific changes in the language of such documents, writings or pleadings which
must be made

82

<PAGE>

in order for such Lender to execute the same. If Agent makes such changes and
resubmits such documents, writings or pleadings to such Lender, then such Lender
shall execute and return the same within five (5) Business Days following
receipt thereof by such Lender.

20.10.3  In the event that all Lenders do not agree pursuant
to Section 20.10.2 above within ten (10) Business Days after such Notice Date,
any Lender may purchase the interest of the non-consenting Lender in the Loan,
without recourse, for a price equal to the sum of the non-consenting Lender's
Loan Percentage in the then outstanding principal balance (together with
unreimbursed Expenses, if any, in the case of a purchase of Agent's interest in
the Loan) plus accrued interest and fees to the date of purchase (the "Purchase
Price"). If any Lender should desire to exercise their option to purchase the
interest of another in the Loan, such non-consenting Lender shall sell its
interest in the Loan to the purchasing Lender for the Purchase Price within
thirty (30) days. If no Lender elects to purchase the interest of the
non-consenting Lender in the Loan within said ten (10) Business Day period, the
provisions of Section 20.10.2 above shall govern. All sales of interests
hereunder shall be without recourse or any warranties or representations except
as to the unencumbered ownership of the interest sold.

20.10.4  If Agent shall take possession of any of the
Collateral after the occurrence of any Event of Default (upon institution of
foreclosure proceedings or otherwise) as and to the extent provided by the Loan
Documents, Agent shall collect all sales proceeds, rents or other operating
revenues and pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with the management
of the Collateral in question and such expenses shall be deemed Expenses as
defined in Section 20.12 below. Upon the unanimous consent of the Lenders, the
Lenders may employ an outside management firm; provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lenders cannot agree as to the employment of a
management firm within ten (10) days of request therefor by Agent, Agent shall
be entitled to employ such management firm as Agent deems necessary to protect
and enforce the interests and rights of all the Lenders. All management and
other fees and expenses paid by Agent shall be deducted from rents and/or sales
proceeds collected, or if such rents and sales proceeds are insufficient, such
fees and expenses shall be paid by Agent and such fees and expenses shall be
deemed Expenses as defined in Section 20.12 below; and each Lender shall within
thirty (30) days of request therefor pay to Agent such Lender's Loan Percentage
thereof.

20.10.5  If there shall be a foreclosure sale of all or a
portion of the Collateral, Agent shall bid at the foreclosure sale on behalf of
Lenders to raise any bid made by others at said sale, up to the highest price
agreed upon by the Required Lenders (not to exceed the outstanding principal
balance of the Loan and all accrued interest thereon), or if the Required
Lenders are unable to agree, then an amount not to exceed the indebtedness
outstanding under the Loan Documents. Upon completion of a foreclosure sale and
the conveyance of said Collateral to the highest bidder, Agent shall render an
accounting for monies received and monies expended between the date of taking
possession of such Collateral and the date of conveyance to the highest bidder,
including without limitation expenses of foreclosure. If the highest bidder
shall be someone other than Agent, then, upon receipt from the highest bidder of
the amount of the bid, Agent will remit each Lender's Loan Percentage of the net
amount received from the foreclosure sale to such Lender, which amount shall
exclude all Expenses incurred by Agent and not previously reimbursed. If the
highest bidder shall be Agent, then, Agent will cause to be executed, delivered
and recorded an appropriate deed(s) of such Collateral

83

<PAGE>

to the Lenders or their nominees, as tenants in common, as soon as is
practicable (but not earlier than ten (10) Business Days after the foreclosure
sale). If the highest bidder shall be Agent, then this Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect during such ownership of the Collateral and this
Agreement shall govern the rights and obligations of the parties in connection
with such ownership. Should Agent or any of the Lenders receive an offer for the
purchase of any portion of the Collateral acquired pursuant to a foreclosure
sale, then such party shall provide written notice of such offer, together with
a copy of such offer, to the other Lenders and Agent, if applicable. If the
Required Lenders do not agree on whether to accept or reject such offer within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of receipt of notice of such offer by the
other Lender and Agent, if applicable, then Agent may either accept or reject
such offer on behalf of Lenders if Agent, in the exercise of its good faith
business judgment, determines that the decision to accept or reject such offer
is in the best interests of the Lenders. Agent shall promptly thereafter provide
written notice of its actions with respect to such offer to the Lenders.

20.10.6  If all Lenders agree to take a purchase money
obligation and security instrument or security interest in part payment for the
sale of any of the Collateral acquired by Lenders or their nominees, as the case
may be, such Lenders or nominees agree to enter into an agreement with respect
to that obligation and security instrument or security interest, defining
Lenders' or their nominees' rights in the same in accordance with Lenders' or
their nominees' Loan Percentage, which agreement shall be in all material
respects similar to this Agreement, to the extent this Agreement is appropriate
or applicable. In the absence of such an agreement, the obligation and security
instrument or security interest shall be held by the mortgagee or security
interest holder for the ratable benefit of Lenders and nominees and shall be
subject to the terms of this Agreement to the extent applicable.

20.10.7  Agent and Lenders acknowledge and agree that Agent
will not take any of the following actions unless and until all Lenders shall
have given their consent thereto in writing:

(a)      any change in or waiver of any required
payments of principal, interest, expenses, or fees payable under the Loan
Agreement or any changes of applicable interest rates or fees payable on the
Loan except as provided in this Agreement;

(b)      any release of Collateral except as provided
by Section 6.3 of this Agreement;

(c)      any change to required release payments;

(d)      any release of Borrower or any Guarantor
(except as provided in Section 6.3.2 above) from its Obligations;

(e)      any extension of the Maturity Date, except
as contemplated pursuant to Section 4.6 of this Agreement;

(f)      any modification of the provisions of this
Section 20.10.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement requiring the unanimous consent
or approval of the Lenders to require a lesser number of Lenders for such
consent or approval; or

84

<PAGE>

(g)      any change in the definition of Majority
Lenders or Required Lenders.

20.10.8  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Agent may, without consent of Lenders, and in its reasonable
discretion if it determines such action is in the best interest of all Lenders:

(a)      waive any non-material condition precedent
under this Agreement for making Advances;

(b)      approve non-material changes in the Plans
and Specifications;

(c)      permit non-material modifications and
reallocations in the Project Budgets so long as such modifications and
reallocations are made in accordance with Section 713.3471 of the Florida
Statutes (or similar Requirements of other states where Projects are located);

(d)      make routine releases of any portion of the
Collateral in connection with a sale of such Collateral as provided in this
Agreement; and

(e)      upon repayment in full of the Loan, release
the balance of the Collateral and satisfy the Security Instruments encumbering
the Collateral.

Agent shall promptly provide written notice of any of the
foregoing actions to the Lenders.

20.10.9  Agent shall not be required to obtain the consent of
Lenders to its taking any action with respect to the Loan if immediate action is
required to be taken in the best interest of Lenders to preserve or protect the
Collateral or the continued perfection or priority of the Lenders' security
title and lien on the Collateral or the continued enforceability of the Loan
Documents; provided however, that Agent shall endeavor to notify the Lenders of
any such actions as soon as practical.

20.10.10 Subject to the provisions of Section 20.10.2 hereof
and Section 20.12 hereof, Agent may engage and consult with legal counsel,
independent public accountants and other experts in connection with the
performance of its administration and servicing under this Article 20. Agent
shall not be liable for actions taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by
Agent in accordance with the advice of such experts so long as such action or
omission does not violate another provision of this Article 20 and such action
taken or omitted to be taken does not constitute willful misconduct or gross
negligence.

20.10.11 If written consent is required for some action under
this Article 20 or otherwise under this Agreement, each Lender agrees to give
Agent or the other Lenders, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the
request for action together with all reasonably requested information related
thereto (or such lesser period of time required by the terms of the Loan
Documents), notice in writing of its approval or disapproval (collectively
"Directions") in respect of any action requested or proposed in writing pursuant
to the terms hereof. If written consent is required for the requested action,
any Lender's failure to respond to a request for

85

<PAGE>

Directions within the required time period shall be deemed to constitute a
Direction to take such requested action. Each Lender shall be entitled to assume
that any officer of the other Lenders delivering any notice, consent,
certificate or other writing is authorized to give such notice, consent,
certificate or other writing unless such Lender has otherwise been notified.

20.11    CREDIT DECISION. It is understood and agreed by each Lender
that each Lender has itself been and will continue to be solely responsible for
making its own independent appraisal of and investigations into the financial
condition, credit worthiness, condition, status, nature and affairs of Borrower.
Agent shall furnish to each Lender a copy of any written notice hereafter
furnished to Agent by Borrower under the Loan Documents as soon as reasonably
practical, but in any event, within five (5) Business Days after the date on
which Agent shall receive the same. In the event that any Lender shall breach or
fail to perform any of its duties or obligations hereunder or be liable
hereunder for its gross negligence or willful misconduct, such party shall be
liable to the aggrieved party only for actual direct damages that would put the
aggrieved party in the same position it would have been in if the breach,
failure, gross negligence or willful misconduct had not occurred, and shall not
be otherwise liable for any punitive, special, indirect or consequential
damages.

20.12    COST AND EXPENSE SHARING. Within thirty (30) days of request
therefor from Agent and in the manner set forth within Section 20.3 above, each
Lender will pay its pro rata share (equal to its Loan Percentage) of all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees, appraisers' fees and consultants' fees) which are
incurred by Agent (i) in connection with the administration of the Loan and the
Loan Documents or enforcement of the obligations of Borrower under the Loan and
the Loan Documents, (ii) in connection with the foreclosure of the Loan
Documents, or (iii) which by the terms of this Agreement are deemed to be
expenses (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Expenses"). The Lenders
shall pay their Loan Percentage of Expenses for attorneys, appraisers, and
consultants, provided that: (x) Agent shall retain such attorney, appraiser or
consultant after approval of each Lender and (y) such attorney, appraiser or
consultant shall have provided a budget for the matter or representation, to be
updated quarterly if the matter or representation shall exceed three (3) months
in duration, in form and content acceptable to all Lenders. In the event Agent
later receives reimbursement from Borrower or another source for such costs and
expenses, Agent shall refund to each Lender its ratable share of such
reimbursement. Each Lender shall bear the cost of its own attorneys' fees in
connection with this Agreement.

20.13    TRANSFERS.

20.13.1  No Lender shall transfer its interest in the Loan or
the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of Agent and, provided no
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that each such transfer
("Transfer") shall comply with the following:

(a)      each such assignment shall be of a constant,
and not a varying, percentage of all the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement;

86

<PAGE>

(b)      each assignment shall be in an amount that
is at least $10,000,000.00 and is a whole multiple of $1,000,000.00, unless
otherwise consented to by Agent;

(c)      each Lender which does not transfer one
hundred percent (100%) of its Commitment shall retain, free of any such
assignment, a Commitment of not less than $10,000,000.00;

(d)      the transferee shall be an Eligible
Assignee; and

(e)      the parties to such assignment shall execute
and deliver to Agent, for recording in the Register (as hereinafter defined), an
Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the form established by Agent (an
"Assignment and Acceptance"), together with any Notes subject to such
assignment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender may transfer its
interest in the Loan and the Loan Documents to its parent company or its parent
company's wholly-owned Subsidiary or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of such Lender
without the prior consent of Agent and Borrower, provided that such transferee
shall remain a parent company of the transferring Lender or a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the transferring Lender's parent company, or a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the transferring Lender and, provided further, that each Lender
(or any guarantor thereof) shall not be relieved of any liability it may have
under this Agreement. The consent by Agent and Borrower to a Transfer shall not
waive the right of Agent and Borrower to consent to subsequent Transfers. Upon
each assignment by a Lender approved by Agent and Borrower, except for
assignment to an Affiliate of any such Lender and any assignments by the Lender
serving as Agent at the time of such assignment, the assigning Lender agrees to
pay to Agent a registration fee in the sum of $5,000.00.

20.13.2  Agent shall not transfer or assign any of its rights
and duties under this Agreement and shall not delegate such rights and duties,
or the execution thereof, without the prior written consent of all Lenders,
except to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Agent, provided that such transferee
shall remain a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Agent and, provided further that Agent
shall not be relieved of any liability it may have under this Agreement.

20.13.3  Each Lender represents to and covenants with the
other that its interest in the Loan is not and during the term of this Agreement
shall not be subject to any lien or monetary encumbrance.

20.13.4  Each Lender may at any time pledge or assign all or
any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents to any of the twelve (12)
Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12
U.S.C. Section 341. No such pledge or assignment or enforcement thereof shall
release such Lender from its obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

20.13.5  Each Lender may sell participations to one or more
Eligible Assignees in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided that

87

<PAGE>

(a)      any such sale or participation shall not
affect the rights and duties of the selling Lender hereunder to the Borrower;

(b)      such participation shall not entitle such
participant to any rights or privileges under this Agreement or the Loan
Documents, including, without limitation, the right to approve waivers,
amendments or modifications, unless the unanimous consent of the Lenders is
required for such waiver, amendment or modification;

(c)      such participant shall have no direct rights
against the Borrower;

(d)      such sale is effected in accordance with all
laws applicable to such selling Lender; and

(e)      such sale or participation shall otherwise
comply with the requirements for a transfer or assignment set forth in Section
20.13.1 above.

20.14    LENDER'S DEFAULT.

20.14.1  Any Lender failing to advance any funds as required
in this Agreement shall constitute a "Defaulting Lender." Upon the failure of a
Defaulting Lender to advance any funds as required in this Agreement (the
"Defaulted Advance"), the other Lenders (collectively, the "Non-Defaulting
Lenders"), or any of them, may, but shall not be obligated to, make such
Defaulted Advance on behalf of the Defaulting Lender, which shall in no way
relieve the Defaulting Lender from its obligation to deposit its share of
Advances on the Loan as provided above. In such event, the Defaulting Lender
shall immediately be obligated to repay the Defaulted Advance to the
Non-Defaulting Lenders making such Defaulted Advance, together with accrued
interest thereon from the date of such funding until repaid to such
Non-Defaulting Lenders as provided in Section 20.3.3 above.

20.14.2  Until such time as such Defaulting Lender has funded
its portion of such Advance, such Defaulting Lender shall have no right to vote
regarding any issue on which voting is required or advisable under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (and the Loan Percentages of the
Non-Defaulting Lenders shall be grossed up on a pro rata basis to reflect the
suspension of the Defaulting Lender).

20.14.3  If a Defaulting Lender fails to advance any funds as
required in this Agreement and such Non-Defaulting Lenders advance funds on the
Defaulting Lender's behalf, until full repayment of the foregoing amount, Agent
shall pay to such Non-Defaulting Lenders for application on account of the
Defaulting Lender's obligation to repay the amounts advanced by such
Non-Defaulting Lenders, any sums, collections or recoveries otherwise payable to
the Defaulting Lender.

20.14.4  Agent or, if Agent is the Defaulting Lender, any of
the Non-Defaulting Lenders shall be entitled to purchase such Defaulting
Lender's entire interest for the Purchase Price (as defined in Section 20.10.3
above) pursuant to the procedure provided for in Section 20.10.3 above, which
right of purchase may be exercised by Agent or the Non-Defaulting Lenders for so
long as such Defaulting Lender does not cure such default. If neither Agent nor
any of the Lenders elects to purchase such Defaulting Lender's interest within
ten (10) Business

88

<PAGE>

Days after notice from Agent of such option, Borrower shall have the right,
provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, to seek a
replacement for such Defaulting Lender, subject to Agent's prior approval of
same, which approval may be given or withheld in Agent's sole and unfettered
discretion.

20.14.5  In the event Agent is a Defaulting Lender, the
Required Lenders may vote to remove Agent and may vote to appoint a successor
Agent upon a vote of a majority of Non-Defaulting Lenders (based on their Loan
Percentages), as set forth in Section 20.24 hereof.

20.14.6  In the event that any Lender fails to make any
payment to the other Lenders or to Borrower (other than the funding of an
Advance) in accordance with this Agreement or the Loan Documents, or otherwise
fails to comply with the terms of this Article 20 within ten (10) days after
receipt of written notice from the other Lenders or Agent, the party so failing
shall also be deemed a "Defaulting Lender" under this Article 20, but shall have
the right at all times to cure such default.

20.15    PERFORMANCE THROUGH REPRESENTATIVES. Agent may perform any of
its duties hereunder by or through officers, directors, employees, attorneys, or
agents (collectively "Representatives").

20.16    NO RELIANCE BY OTHERS. Except as provided above in the
introductory paragraph to this Article 20, none of the provisions of this
Article 20 shall inure to the benefit of any person other than Lenders and
Agent; consequently, neither Borrower nor any other person, shall be entitled to
rely upon or raise as a defense, in any manner whatsoever, the failure of any
one of Lenders or Agent to comply with the provisions of this Article 20. None
of the Lenders or Agent shall incur any liability to Borrower or any other
person for any act or omission of the Lenders or Agent.

20.17    LEGAL FEES. If any legal or equitable action or proceeding is
brought by a Lender to enforce or construe a provision of this Article 20, the
unsuccessful party in such action or proceeding, whether such action or
proceeding is settled or prosecuted to final judgment, shall pay all of the
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the prevailing party.

20.18    TERMINATION. Unless otherwise agreed to by Agent and Lenders,
the rights and obligations of Agent and Lenders shall terminate when the Loan
has been paid and finally discharged in full and the obligations of the Lenders
to advance funds to Borrower under the Loan Agreement are terminated, or if the
Lenders or the Lenders' nominees take title to the Projects by foreclosure or
conveyance in lieu of foreclosure, when the Projects are thereafter sold to a
third party purchaser. The provisions of Section 20.12 of this Agreement shall
survive repayment of the Loan and termination of this Agreement.

20.19    LITIGATION UNDER LOAN DOCUMENTS. Each Lender is a necessary
party to any litigation of Borrower against any Lender under the Loan Documents.
In the event suit is brought by Borrower or by an Affiliate of Borrower against
any Lender or Agent, Agent or any such Lender shall be entitled to join the
other Lenders in such suit.

20.20    WITHHOLDING TAX.

20.20.1  If any Lender is a "foreign corporation, partnership
or trust" within the meaning of the Code and such Lender claims exemption from,
or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code,
such Lender agrees with and in favor of Agent, to deliver to Agent:

(a)      if such Lender claims an exemption from, or
a reduction of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, properly
completed IRS Forms 1098 W8-BEN or Form 1098 W8-ECI before the payment of any
interest in the first calendar year and before the payment of any interest in
each third succeeding calendar year during which interest may be paid under this
Agreement;

(b)      if such Lender claims that interest paid
under this Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is
effectively connected with a United States trade or business of such Lender, two
(2) properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form 4224 before the payment
of any interest is due in the first taxable year of such Lender and in each
succeeding taxable year of such Lender during which interest may be paid under
this Agreement, and IRS Form W-9;

(c)      such other form or forms as may be required
under the Code or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption
from, or reduction of, United States withholding tax; and

(d)      in the case of any Lender claiming exemption
from U.S. Withholding Tax under Section 871(b) or 881(c) of the Code, with
respect to payments of "Portfolio Interest", a Form W-8, or any subsequent
versions thereof or successors thereto and if the Lender delivers a Form W-8, a
certificate representing that such Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section
881(c) of the Code, is not a ten percent (10%) shareholder (within the meaning
of Section 871(h)(3)(b) of the Code) of Borrower, and is not a controlled
foreign corporation related to Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4)
of the Code).

Each such certificate and form shall be properly completed and
duly executed by such Lender claiming complete exemption from a reduced rate of
U.S. Withholding Tax on payments by Borrower under this Agreement and other Loan
Documents. Each Lender agrees to promptly notify Agent of any change in
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
reduction.

20.20.2  If any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form 1098
W8-BEN or Form 1098 W8-ECI and such Lender sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of
Borrower to such Lender, such Lender agrees to notify Agent of the percentage
amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrower
to such Lender. To the extent of such percentage amount, Agent will treat such
Lender's IRS Form 1098 W8-BEN or Form 1098 W8-ECI as no longer valid.

90

<PAGE>

20.20.3  If any Lender claiming exemption from United States
withholding tax by filing IRS Form 4224 with Agent sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of
Borrower to such Lender, such Lender agrees to undertake sole responsibility for
complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and
1442 of the Code.

20.20.4  If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the
applicable withholding tax, Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such
Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into
account such reduction. If the forms or other documentation required by above
Section 20.20.1 are not delivered to Agent, then Agent may withhold from any
interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other documentation
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

20.20.5  If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the
United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the
exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other
reason) such Lender shall indemnify Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly
or indirectly, by Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to
Agent under this Section 20.20, together with all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and legal expenses). The obligation of the Lenders
under this Section 20.20.5 shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the
resignation or replacement of Agent.

20.20.6  The indemnity provision of Section 20.20.5 above may
be suspended or waived by Agent with respect to any Lender at its sole election
("Non-Indemnitor Lender"). In addition to any other rights of offset contained
in this Agreement or under any applicable law, or so long as a Non-Indemnitor
Lender is a Lender, in the event that any amounts would otherwise be covered by
an indemnity under Section 20.20.5 of this Agreement from a Non-Indemnitor
Lender, such as U.S. Withholding Tax due and payable and any penalties or
interest with respect thereto and fees and expenses of collection, then in such
event, Agent shall be authorized to offset any such amounts against the amounts
payable to a Non-Indemnitor Lender hereunder until otherwise indemnified amounts
are fully paid. The right of offset contained herein shall be in addition to and
shall not limit or otherwise waive or diminish any right or remedy that Agent
may have against a Non-Indemnitor Lender under any applicable law.

20.21    NO REPRESENTATIONS. Agent shall not be responsible for the
execution or validity or enforceability of this Agreement, the Notes, any of the
other Loan Documents or any instrument at any time constituting, or intended to
constitute, collateral security for the Notes, or for the value of any such
collateral security or for the validity, enforceability or collectability of any
such amounts owing with respect to the Notes, or for any recitals or statements,
warranties or representations made herein or in any of the other Loan Documents
or in any certificate or instrument hereafter furnished to it by or on behalf of
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or be bound to ascertain or inquire as to
the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or
agreements herein or in any instrument at any time constituting, or intended to
constitute, collateral security for the Notes. Agent shall not be bound to
ascertain whether any

91

<PAGE>

notice, consent, waiver or request delivered to it by Borrower or any holder of
any of the Notes shall have been duly authorized or is true, accurate and
complete. Agent has not made nor does it now make any representations or
warranties, express or implied, nor does it assume any liability to the Lenders,
with respect to the credit worthiness or financial condition of Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such information
and documents as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement.

20.22    INDEMNITY. The Lenders, as to their respective Loan
Percentage, agree hereby to indemnify and hold harmless Agent from and against
any and all claims, actions and suits (whether groundless or otherwise), losses,
damages, costs, expenses (including any expenses for which Agent has not been
reimbursed by Borrower as required by Article 15), and liabilities of every
nature and character arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Notes, or
any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated or evidenced
hereby or thereby, or Agent's actions taken hereunder or thereunder, in good
faith, except to the extent that any of the same shall be caused by Agent's
willful misconduct or gross negligence.

20.23    AGENT AS LENDER. In its individual capacity, Agent shall have
the same obligations and the same rights, powers and privileges in respect to
its Commitment and the portion of the Loan made by it, and as the holder of a
Note as it would have were it not also Agent.

20.24    RESIGNATION. Agent may resign at any time by giving sixty (60)
days' prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and Borrower. In addition, the
Required Lenders may remove the Agent from its capacity as agent in the event of
the Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence or in the event that the
Agent is in receivership, conservatorship or other similar proceeding in which
the day-to-day activities of the Agent are controlled or subject to approval by
any applicable Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Agent. Upon
any such resignation or upon removal of Agent as set forth in the preceding
sentence or in Section 20.14.1 hereof, the Majority Lenders shall have the right
to appoint a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed
by the Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days
after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring
Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a
financial institution having a rating of not less than A-2 or its equivalent by
Standard & Poor's Corporation. In either case, unless an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, such successor Agent shall be reasonably
acceptable to Borrower (such notice and time to cure will be provided by Agent
only in the event of a pending appointment of successor Agent, and applies only
for the purposes of this Section 20.24). Upon the acceptance of any appointment
as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Agent or the removed Agent, and the retiring or replaced Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any
retiring Agent's resignation, or the removal of any Agent pursuant to this
Section 20.24 or Section 20.14.5 hereof, the provisions of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of
any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

92

<PAGE>

20.25    BANKRUPTCY. In the event a bankruptcy or other insolvency
proceeding is commenced by or against Borrower, Agent shall have the sole and
exclusive right to file and pursue a joint proof of claim on behalf of all
Lenders. Each Lender irrevocably waives its right to file or pursue a separate
proof of claim in any such proceedings so long as Agent is prosecuting a joint
proof of claim on behalf of all Lenders.

20.26    DISCLOSURE. Fleet National Bank hereby discloses to the
Lenders that it is a Lender and Lead Agent under the Senior Unsecured Revolving
Credit Agreement. The Lenders hereby acknowledge the foregoing disclosure and
that Fleet National Bank, as Lead Agent under the Senior Unsecured Revolving
Credit Agreement, may take actions which may conflict with actions taken by
Agent as Agent hereunder. The Lenders agree that Fleet National Bank is hereby
authorized by the Lenders to continue in the capacity as Agent and to fulfill
the role of Agent hereunder notwithstanding its serving as Lead Agent under the
Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement and that Fleet National Bank, as
Agent under this Agreement, will not be liable to the Lenders under this Loan
for actions taken under the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement.

20.27    CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Lender agrees to take normal and
reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of
all information identified as "confidential" or "secret" by the Borrower
(including, without limitation, business plans, prospective financial
information, litigation claims and other non-public information) and provided to
it by the Borrower, or by the Agent on Borrower's behalf, under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document (collectively, "Confidential Information"), and
neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such Confidential Information
other than in connection with or in enforcement of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, except to the extent such Confidential Information (i) was or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure
by the Lender, or (ii) was or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from
a source other than the Borrower, provided that such source is not bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Borrower known to the Lender; provided,
however, that any Lender may use such Confidential Information in the
underwriting of any other loans requested by Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates or disclose such Confidential Information as follows:

(a)      at the request or pursuant to any
requirement of any Governmental Authority to which the Lender is subject or in
connection with an examination of such Lender by any such Governmental
Authority;

(b)      pursuant to subpoena or other court process;

(c)      when required to do so in accordance with
the provisions of any applicable Requirements;

(d)      to the extent reasonably required in
connection with any litigation or proceeding to which the Agent, any Lender or
their respective Affiliates may be party;

(e)      to the extent reasonably required in
connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan
Document;

93

<PAGE>

(f)      to such Lender's independent auditors and
other professional advisors;

(g)      to any participant or assignee first
approved by Borrower in accordance with Section 20.13 above (provided no Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), provided that such Person
agrees in writing to keep such Confidential Information confidential to the same
extent required of the Lenders hereunder; and

(h)      as to any Lender, as expressly permitted
under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to
which the Borrower is a party or is deemed a party with such Lender.

ARTICLE 21
NO ASSIGNMENT BY BORROWER.

Without the prior approval of the Agent and the Required
Lenders, Borrower shall not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations
under any of the Loan Documents.

ARTICLE 22
RELATIONSHIP

The relationship between the Lenders and Borrower is solely
that of a lender and borrower, and nothing contained herein or in any of the
other Loan Documents shall in any manner be construed as making the parties
hereto partners, joint venturers or any other relationship other than lenders
and borrower.

ARTICLE 26
HEADINGS

The captions in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not define or limit the provisions hereof.

ARTICLE 27
COUNTERPARTS

This Agreement and any amendment hereof may be executed in
several counterparts and by each party on a separate counterpart, each of which
when so executed and delivered shall be an original, and all of which together
shall constitute one instrument. In proving this Agreement it shall not be
necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart signed by the
party against whom enforcement is sought.

ARTICLE 28
ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

The Loan Documents and any other documents executed in
connection herewith or therewith express the entire understanding of the parties
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither this Agreement nor
any term hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated, except as
provided in Article 29.

ARTICLE 29
CONSENTS, AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC.

Subject to the provisions of Article 20 and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, any term of any of the Loan Documents
(other than this Agreement) may be amended, and the performance or observance by
Borrower of any terms of this Agreement or such other Loan Documents may be
waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) with, but only with, the written consent of Agent, provided
however, that (i) any modification of this Agreement requires the approval of
the Required Lenders, including Agent, and (ii) the waiver of any Event of
Default shall require the approval of the Majority Lenders. Lenders hereby
authorize and direct Agent to take any and all such actions to be taken by Agent
under this Agreement and the Loan Documents subject to the provisions of this
Article 29 and of Article 20 hereof. Nothing contained in this Article 29 shall
prohibit Agent from undertaking actions in administering the Loan in a
commercially reasonable manner. No waiver shall extend to or affect any
obligation not expressly waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No
course of dealing or delay or omission on the part of Agent and Lenders in
exercising any right shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise be
prejudicial thereto. No Advance made by the Lenders hereunder during the
continuance of any Default or Event of Default shall constitute a waiver
thereof. No notice to or demand upon Borrower shall entitle Borrower to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

United States Dollars(US$17,600,000.00) (herein called the “Contract

.








ARTICLE
III - ADJUSTMENT OF CONTRACT PRICE




The
Contract Price shall be subject to adjustment, as hereinafter set forth, in
the
event of the following contingencies (it being understood by both parties that
any reduction of the Contract Price is by way of liquidated damages and not
by
way of penalty):





A.


Delivery:











1.


No
adjustment shall be made and the Contract Price shall remain unchanged
for
the first thirty (30) days of delay in delivery of the Vessel beyond
the
Delivery Date as defined in Article VII hereof (ending as of twelve
o’clock midnight Central Standard Time of the thirtieth (30th) day
of
delay).








2.


Builder recognizes
that the timely delivery of the Vessel is critical to the operation
and
success of Buyer’s business, and that any failure to timely deliver the
completed Vessel is likely to result in Buyer sustaining significant
damages which may be difficult to measure. Further, the Parties
acknowledge that longer delays may have commercial ramifications
that
would likely result in even greater damages which may be difficult
to
measure. Accordingly, the Parties have agreed to the following measure
of
damages to be paid by Builder to the Buyer in the event of Builder’s
failure to timely deliver the completed Vessel. The following measure
of
damages represents a reasonable estimate of the damages that may
be
sustained by the Buyer in the event that Builder fails to timely
deliver
the Vessel.














If
the delivery of the Vessel is delayed more than thirty (30) days
after the
Delivery Date, then, in such event, beginning at twelve o’clock midnight
of the thirtieth (30th) day after the Delivery Date, the Builder
shall pay
to the Buyer liquidated damages at the rates and in the manner specified
below:






31st-60th
day   $5,000.00
per
diem

61st-90th
day   $5,500.00 per
diem


90th
day   $50,000
payment

91st-120th
day   $6,000.00 per
diem


120th
day   $75,000
payment

121st-150th
day   $6,500.00 per
diem

150th
day   $100,000
payment

151st-180th
day   $7,000.00 per
diem







Provided,
that prior to exercising such right to deduct any such liquidated
damages,
Buyer shall set forth in writing to Builder the amount (and related
supporting calculations) of the liquidated damages claimed by Buyer.
If
Builder disputes any such claimed liquidated damages, then an amount
equal
to the amount claimed by Buyer shall be placed in escrow by Buyer
pursuant
to an escrow agreement and with an escrow agent mutually satisfactory
to
Buyer and Builder until such time as the dispute with respect to
the
underlying claim is resolved between the parties by mutual agreement
or
pursuant to Article XIII below.









At
Buyer’s option, the Builder shall pay any liquidated damages directly to Buyer
or Buyer may deduct the amount of any liquidated damages from the Contract
Price
or other amounts owing to Builder or invoiced hereunder.






3.


The
total reduction in the Contract Price shall not be more than as would
be
the case for a delay of one hundred eighty (180) days, counting from
midnight of the thirtieth (30th)
day after the Delivery Date at the above-specified rate of
reduction.








4.


If
the delay in delivery of the Vessel should continue for a period
of one
hundred eighty (180) days from the thirty-first (31st)
day after the Delivery Date, then in such event, and after such period
has
expired, Buyer may at its option rescind this Contract in accordance
with
the provisions of Article X hereof. Builder may, at any time after
the
expiration of the aforementioned one hundred eighty(180) days of
delay in
delivery, if Buyer has not served notice of rescission as provided
in
Article X hereof, demand in writing that Buyer shall make an election,
in
which case Buyer shall, within fifteen (15) days after such demand
is
received by Buyer, notify Builder of its intention either to rescind
this
Contract or to consent to the delivery of the Vessel at an agreed
reduction in price and future date; it being understood by the parties
hereto that, if the Vessel is not delivered by such future date,
Buyer
shall have the same right of rescission upon the same terms and conditions
as hereinabove provided.











5.


Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event Hull Number ___ is delivered late and
results
in liquidated damages accrued to the Builder, and Builder delivers
Hull
Number 8066 before its delivery date, Builder shall recover accrued
liquidated damages for Hull Number ____ by an amount equal to the
total of
the amounts set forth in the schedule of liquidated damages (Article
2
above) for each day that delivery of Hull 8066 is early. For the
avoidance
of any doubt, if Builder delivers Hull 8066 fifteen (15) days early,
Builder shall be entitled to an offset of seventy-five thousand United
States Dollars (US$75,000.00), or fifteen (15) days multiplied by
US$5,000.00 per day. Any payment due to Builder under this Article
III(A)(5) will be agreed at the time of delivery of Hull 8066 prior
to the
Delivery Date and paid at the time of delivery of Hull 8066.











6.


If
Buyer requests in writing that the delivery of the Vessel be made
earlier
than the Delivery Date, and if the delivery of the Vessel is made,
in
response to such request of Buyer, more than thirty (30) days earlier
than
the Delivery Date, then, in such event, beginning with the thirty-first
(31st)
day prior to the Delivery Date, the Contract Price of the Vessel
shall be
increased by adding thereto five thousand United States Dollars
(US$5,000.00) for each full day (it being understood that Builder's
acceptance of such request by Buyer for early delivery shall in no
way be
construed as a change or alteration of the Delivery Date under this
Contract).











B.


Maximum
Liquidated Damages and Effect of Rescission:








Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Article III, it is expressly understood
and
agreed by the parties hereto that in any case:









1.


The
aggregate liquidated damages due for payment by Builder to Buyer
pursuant
to this Article III shall not exceed $936,000.00 and;











2.


If
Buyer rescinds this Contract under Paragraph A of this Article III,
Buyer
shall not be entitled to any liquidated damages.






































ARTICLE
IV - APPROVAL OF PLANS AND DRAWINGS AND

INSPECTION
DURING CONSTRUCTION



A.


Approval
of Plans and Drawings:











1.


Builder
shall submit to Buyer three (3) copies of the plans and drawings
required
to be submitted thereto for its review in accordance with the
Specifications. Buyer shall, within ten (10) days after receipt thereof,
return to Builder one (1) copy of such plans and drawings with Buyer’s
comments written thereon, if any.










2.


When
and if Buyer’s Representative shall have been sent by Buyer to Builder in
accordance with Paragraph B of this Article, Builder may submit the
plans
and drawings to Buyer’s Representative for his review, unless otherwise
agreed upon between the parties. Buyer’s Representative shall, within ten
(10) days after receipt thereof, return to Builder one (1) copy of
such
plans and drawings with his comments written thereon, if any. Review
by
Buyer’s Representative of the plans and drawings duly submitted to him
shall be deemed to be the review by Buyer for all purposes of this
Contract. In the event that the comments of the Buyer or the Buyer’s
Representative provided pursuant to this Article IV(A)(2) and the
preceding Article IV(A)(1) are not agreed by the Builder, the parties
hereby agree to negotiate in good faith with a view to settlement
of the
same within fifteen (15) days, subject to mutually agreed extension,
failing which the matter shall be decided upon by a senior surveyor
of the
Classification Society.











3.


In
the event that Buyer or Buyer’s Representative shall fail to return the
plans and drawings to Builder within the time limit as hereinabove
provided, such plans and drawings shall be deemed to have been
automatically reviewed without any
comment.











B.


Appointment
of Buyer’s Representative:











Buyer
may send to and maintain at the Shipyard, at Buyer’s own cost and expense,
one representative who shall be duly authorized in writing by Buyer
(herein called “Buyer’s Representative”) to act on behalf of Buyer in
connection with modifications of the Specifications, adjustments
of the
Contract Price, approval of the plans and drawings, attendance to
the
tests and inspections relating to the Vessel, its machinery, equipment
and
outfitting, and any other matters for which he is specifically authorized
by Buyer.








Buyer
shall only have one representative with authority to approve any change order
in
connection with any work performed on the Vessel in connection with this
Contract, and that representative is Larry D. Francois. Change orders for
additional work under this contract will be considered approved only when Larry
D. Francois has stated such approval in a writing specifying that work subject
to the change order, and the agreed price for said work.












C.


Inspection
by Buyer’s Representative:











1.


The
necessary inspections of the Vessel, its machinery, equipment and
outfitting shall be carried out by the Classification Society, other
regulatory bodies and/or an inspection team of Builder throughout
the
entire period of construction, in order to ensure that Milestone
Events
have been achieved and that the construction of the Vessel is duly
performed in accordance with this Contract and the Specifications.
Buyer’s
Representative shall have, during construction of the Vessel, the
right to
attend all tests, trials and inspections of the Vessel, its machinery,
equipment and outfitting. Builder shall give a notice to Buyer’s
Representative reasonably in advance of the date and place of such
tests
and inspections to be attended by him for his convenience. Failure
of
Buyer’s Representative to be present at such tests and inspections after
due notice to him as above provided shall be deemed to be a waiver
of his
right to be present, but shall not be deemed a waiver of any warranties
herein or of Builder’s obligations to correct any
non-conformities.








2.


In
the event that Buyer’s Representative discovers any construction or
material or workmanship which is not deemed to conform to the requirements
of this Contract and/or the Specifications, Buyer’s Representative shall
promptly give Builder
a
notice in writing as to such non-conformity. Upon receipt of such
notice
from Buyer’s Representative, Builder
shall correct such non-conformity, if Builder
agrees to his view. If the Builder does not agree, Builder shall
notify
the Buyer’s Representative in writing of the extent to which Builder does
not agree that corrective measures are required. In the event of
a
difference of opinion between the Parties hereto, the Builder or
the Buyer
may request resolution of the matter in accordance with Article XIII
hereof. In all working hours during the construction of the Vessel
until delivery thereof, Buyer’s Representative shall be given free and
ready access to the Vessel,
its engines and accessories, and to any other place where work is
being
done, or materials are being processed or stored, in connection with
the
construction of the Vessel,
including the yards, workshops, stores and offices of Builder.
Builder
shall seek to arrange with Builder’s subcontractors that Buyer’s
Representative has a similar right of inspection and supervision
in
respect of the work performed by the
subcontractors.














D.


Facilities:











Builder
shall furnish Buyer’s Representative with adequate office space, and such
other reasonable facilities according to the Builder’s practice at or in
the immediate vicinity of the Shipyard as may be necessary to enable
them
to effectively carry out their duties.









F.


Responsibility
of Buyer:











1.


Buyer
shall undertake and assure that Buyer’s Representative shall carry out his
duties hereunder in accordance with the normal shipbuilding practice
of
Builder and in such a way as to avoid any unnecessary increase in
building
cost, delay in or interference with the construction of the Vessel,
and/or
any disturbance in the construction schedule of Builder.












2.


Builder
has the right to request Buyer to replace a Buyer’s Representative who
Builder deems unsuitable and unsatisfactory for the proper progress
of the
Vessel’s construction. Buyer shall investigate the situation by sending
a
senior executive to the Shipyard if necessary, and if Buyer considers
that
such Builder’s request is justified, Buyer shall effect such replacement
as soon as practicable.









ARTICLE
V - MODIFICATIONS



A.


Modifications
of Specifications:











1.


The
Specifications may be modified and/or changed by written agreement
of the
parties, provided that such modifications and/or changes or an
accumulation thereof will not, in Builder’s reasonable judgment, adversely
affect Builder’s planning or program in relation to Builder’s other
commitments, and provided, further, that Buyer shall first agree,
before
such modifications and/or changes are carried out, to alterations
in the
Contract Price, the Delivery Date and other terms and conditions
of this
Contract and Specifications occasioned by or resulting from such
modifications and/or changes. Builder agrees to use best commercial
efforts to accommodate any such reasonable requests by the Buyer
so that
any changes and modifications will be made at a reasonable cost and
within
the shortest period of time as is reasonably possible.









2.


Such
agreement may be effected by an exchange of letters signed by the
authorized representatives of the parties hereto manifesting agreements
of
the parties hereto, which shall constitute amendments to this Contract
and/or the Specifications.








3.


Builder
may make minor changes to the Specifications, if found necessary
for
introduction of improved production methods or otherwise, provided
that
Builder shall first obtain Buyer’s written approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and, if required, the written approval of
the
Classification Society.











B.


Change
in Class:











In
the event that, after the date of this Contract, any requirements
as to
class, or as to rules and regulations (or the interpretation thereof)
to
which the construction of the Vessel are required to conform, are
altered
or changed by the Classification Society, the US Coast Guard or any
other
regulatory bodies authorized to make such alterations or changes,
the
following provisions shall apply:








1.


If
such alterations or changes are compulsory for the Vessel, either
of the
parties hereto, upon receipt of such information from the Classification
Society, the US Coast Guard or such other regulatory bodies, shall
promptly transmit the same to the other in writing, and Builder shall
thereupon incorporate such alterations or changes to the construction
of
the Vessel, provided that Buyer shall first agree to adjustments
required
by Builder in the Contract Price, the Delivery Date and other terms
and
conditions of this Contract and the Specifications occasioned by
or
resulting from such alterations or changes.












2.


If
such alterations or changes are not compulsory for the Vessel, but
Buyer
desires to incorporate such alterations or changes into the construction
of the Vessel, then, Buyer shall notify Builder of such intention.
Builder
must accept such alterations or changes, provided that such alterations
or
changes will not, in the reasonable judgment of Builder, adversely
affect
Builder’s planning or program in relation to Builder’s other commitments,
and provided, further, that Buyer shall first agree to adjustments
required by Builder in the Contract Price, the Delivery Date and
other
terms and conditions of this Contract and the Specifications occasioned
by
or resulting from such alterations or changes.










Agreements
as to such alterations or changes under this Article shall be made in the same
manner as provided in Article A of this Article for modifications or changes
to
the Specifications.






C.


Substitution
of Materials:











In
the event that any of the materials required by the Specifications
or
otherwise under this Contract for the construction of the Vessel
cannot be
procured in time or are in short supply to maintain the Delivery
Date of
the Vessel, Builder may, provided that Buyer shall so agree in writing,
which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, supply other
materials
capable of meeting the requirements of the Classification Society,
or of
the US Coast Guard and of the rules, regulations and requirements
with
which the construction of the Vessel must comply. Any agreement as
to such
substitution of materials shall be effected in the manner provided
in
Article A of this Article, and shall, likewise, include alterations
in the
Contract Price and other terms and conditions of this Contract occasioned
by or resulting from such substitution.










ARTICLE
VI - TRIALS






A.


Notice:











Buyer
shall receive from Builder at least three (3) days prior notice in
writing
of the scheduled time and place of the trial runs of the Vessel,
and Buyer
shall promptly acknowledge receipt of such notice. Builder shall
also
provide Buyer with twenty-four (24) hours definite notice of the
time and
place for scheduled sea trials, and Buyer shall promptly confirm
receipt
of same. Buyer shall have Buyer’s Representative on board the Vessel to
witness such trial runs. Should Buyer’s Representative fail to attend the
trial run of the Vessel for any reason after due notice by Buyer
as
provided above, this will be deemed a waiver of Buyer’s right to have a
representative on board the Vessel during the trial run. Builder,
in this
case only, may conduct the trial run without Buyer’s Representative being
present, and in such case Buyer will be obliged to accept Builder’s
certification that the Vessel, during its trial run, was found to
conform
to the Contract and the Specifications.









B.


Weather
Conditions:








The
trial runs shall be carried out under weather conditions deemed favorable
enough in the judgment of Builder. In the event of unfavorable weather
on
the date specified for the trial runs, the same shall take place
on the
first available day thereafter that the weather condition permits.
If
during a trial run of the Vessel, the weather should suddenly become
so
unfavorable that orderly conduct of that trial run can no longer
be
continued, that trial run shall be discontinued and postponed until
the
first favorable day next following, unless Buyer shall assent in
writing
to acceptance of the Vessel on the basis of the trial runs already
made
before such discontinuance has occurred.











Any
delay of trial runs caused by such unfavorable weather condition
shall
operate to postpone the Delivery Date by the period of delay involved
and
such delay shall be deemed as a permissible delay in the delivery
of the
Vessel.











C.


How
Conducted:











1.


All
expenses in connection with the trial runs are to be for the account
of
Builder and Builder shall provide at its own expense the necessary
crew to
comply with conditions of safe navigation. The trial runs shall be
conducted in the manner prescribed in the Specifications, and shall
prove
fulfillment of the performance requirements for the trial runs as
set
forth in the Specifications. Builder shall determine the course of
the
trial runs.











2.


Notwithstanding
the foregoing, fuel oil, lubricating oil and greases necessary for
the
trial runs of the Vessel shall be supplied by Builder at the Shipyard
prior to the time of the trial runs, and Buyer shall pay Builder
upon
delivery of the Vessel the cost of the quantities of fuel oil, lubricating
oil and greases not consumed during the trial runs at their original
purchase price, supported by invoice or other proper documentation.












D.


Method
of Acceptance or Rejection:











1.


Upon
completion of the final trial run, Builder shall give Buyer written
notice
of such completion of the final trial run, and that Builder considers
that
the results of the trial runs indicate conformity of the Vessel to
this
Contract and the Specifications. Buyer shall, within three (3) days
after
receipt of such notice from Builder, provide Builder written notice
of its
acceptance or rejection of the Vessel.


















2.


Should
the parties agree that the results of the trial runs indicate that
the
Vessel, or any part or equipment thereof, does not conform to the
requirements of this Contract and/or the Specifications, or if Builder
is
in agreement with the non-conformity specified in Buyer’s notice of
rejection, Builder shall take necessary steps to correct such
non-conformity. Upon completion of correction of such non-conformity,
Builder shall give Buyer written notice thereof. Buyer shall then
have a
period of five (5) days following the completion of such alterations
or
corrections to re-inspect the Vessel and/or to observe further sea
trial
runs conducted by the Builder at its expense, if such trials are
reasonably necessary to test the repairs. Within five (5) days after
Buyer’s re-inspection and/or observation of re-trial runs, Buyer shall
notify Builder of its acceptance or rejection of the Vessel.









3.


In
any event that Buyer rejects the Vessel, Buyer shall indicate in
its
notice of rejection in what respect the Vessel, or any part or equipment
thereof, does not conform to this Contract and/or the
Specifications.








4.


In
event that Buyer fails to provide Builder written notice of the acceptance
of or the rejection together with the reason therefor of the Vessel
within
the period as provided in the above SubArticle 1 or 2, Buyer shall
be
deemed to have accepted the Vessel.














E.


Effect
of Acceptance:











1.


Acceptance
of the Vessel as above provided shall be final and binding so far
as
conformity of the Vessel to this Contract and the Specifications
is
concerned and shall preclude Buyer from refusing formal delivery
of the
Vessel as hereinafter provided, if Builder complies with all other
procedural requirements for delivery as provided in Article VII hereof.
Such acceptance, however, shall not waive claims for defective work
discovered during the warranty period.









2.


If
any work or items on the Vessel are incomplete or missing when the
Vessel
otherwise is ready for delivery and such work or items do not, in
the
reasonable opinion of the Buyer, materially affect the operation
of the
Vessel nor are likely to cause damage or excessive deterioration
to the
Vessel, Buyer shall, at its option in its reasonable discretion,
conditionally accept the Vessel subject to the right of Buyer to
have such
items completed in a reasonable manner and period of
time.










F.


Disposition
of Surplus Consumable Stores:











Should
any fresh water or other consumable stores furnished by Builder for
the
trial runs remain on board the Vessel at the time of acceptance thereof
by
Buyer, Buyer agrees to buy the same from Builder at the original
purchase
price thereof, supported by invoice or other proper documentation,
and
payment by the Buyer shall be effected upon delivery of the Vessel.

ARTICLE
VIII - DELAYS AND EXTENSION OF TIME

FOR
DELIVERY (FORCE MAJEURE)






A.


Causes
of Delay:








If,
at
any time before the actual delivery, either the construction of the Vessel
or
any performance required as a prerequisite of delivery of the Vessel are delayed
due to Acts of God; acts of princes or rulers; orders by government authorities;
war or other hostilities or preparations therefor; blockade; revolution,
insurrections, mobilization, civil war, civil commotion or riots; vandalism;
sabotages; general or local strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances (other
than strikes, lockouts, or disturbances limited to personnel of Builder or
Shipyard); labor shortage (other than labor shortage limited to personnel of
Builder or Shipyard); plague or other epidemics; quarantines; flood, typhoons,
hurricanes, storms or other weather conditions not included in normal planning;
earthquakes; tidal waves; landslides; fires, explosions; embargoes;; import
restrictions; prolonged failure, shortage or restriction of electric current,
oil or gas supplied to Builder’s premises or the Shipyard; destruction of, or
damage to, the Shipyard or premises of Builder, its subcontractors or suppliers,
or of or to the Vessel or any part thereof, by any causes herein; or any other
events, causes or accidents beyond the reasonable control of either party hereto
which, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts by the affected party, makes
continuance of construction or performance hereunder impossible, the Delivery
Date shall be postponed for a period of time which shall not exceed the total
accumulated time of all such delays.



B.


Notice
of Delay:











Within
five (5) days from the date when Builder knows or reasonably should
have
known of the commencement of the delay on account of which Builder
claims
that it is entitled under this Contract to a postponement of the
Delivery
Date, Builder shall notify Buyer in writing, together with supporting
evidence, of the date such cause of delay commenced and the reasons
therefor. Failure of Builder to so notify Buyer of any claim for
postponement of the Delivery Date within three (3) days of the date
Builder knew or reasonably should have known of the commencement
of such
delay shall be deemed to be a waiver by Builder of its right to raise
such
delay.








Likewise,
within five (5) days after such cause of delay ends, Builder shall
notify
Buyer in writing of the date such delay ended, and also shall specify
the
period of time by which the Delivery Date is postponed by reason
of such
delay. Failure of Buyer to object to Builder’s notification of any claim
for postponement of the Delivery Date within ten (10) days after
receipt
of such claim notification shall be deemed to be a waiver by Buyer
of its
right to object to such
postponement.








C.


Definition
of Permissible Delay:











Delays
on account of such causes as specified in Article VIII(A) and any
other
delays of a nature which under the terms of this Contract permits
postponement of the Delivery Date shall be understood to be permissible
delays and are to be distinguished from unauthorized delays on account
of
which the Contract Price is subject to adjustment as provided for
in
Article III hereof.









D.
Termination
for Extended Force Majeure




If
an
event of Force Majeure lasts more than 180 days, the frustrated party shall
have
the right to terminate this Contract upon 30 days notice; provided, however,
if
the excused party has used and continues to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to remedy, cure and mitigate the effect of the Force Majeure event,
the
frustrated party’s right to terminate this contract shall be suspended for so
long as excused party continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to
remedy, cure and mitigate the effect of the Force Majeure event.




If
an
event of Force Majeure lasts for more than 210 days, the frustrated party shall
have the right to terminate this Contract upon 30 days notice, without regard
to
the excused party’s efforts to remedy, cure and mitigate the effect of the Force
Majeure event.




ARTICLE
IX - WARRANTY OF QUALITY






A.


Warranty:











Subject
to the provisions hereinafter set forth, Builder warrants for a period
of
twelve (12) months after delivery and acceptance of the Vessel (“the
Warranty Period”) that all parts of the Vessel fabricated by Builder shall
be free from defect in material and workmanship, whether latent or
patent,
that
the work shall be done in a good, substantial and workmanlike manner
and
in accordance with the Specifications and Drawings, and that, unless
otherwise specified, all materials and equipment incorporated in
the work
will be new.

















Builder
undertakes to remedy, free of charge to Buyer, any defects in the
Vessel
which are due to defective material and/or workmanship of all parts
of the
Vessel fabricated by the Builder, provided that the defects are discovered
and a notice thereof is duly given to Builder as provided below,
within
the Warranty Period. The aforesaid warranty excludes any parts for
the
Vessel that have been supplied by or on behalf of the Buyer or its
agents
and by any machinery, equipment and systems manufacturers. Builder
shall
procure commercially reasonable warranties from all suppliers and
vendors,
and shall assign equipment, machinery and systems manufacturer’s
warranties to the Buyer.











B.


Notice
of Defects:











Buyer
shall notify Builder in writing of any defects for which claim is
made
under this warranty as promptly as feasible after discovery thereof.
If
the defect was discovered during dry-docking of the Vessel, Buyer
must
notify Builder in time for Builder to inspect the defect before the
Vessel
leaves the dry dock. Buyer’s written notice shall describe the nature and
extent of the defects. Builder shall have no obligation for any defects
discovered after the expiration of the Warranty
Period.








C.


Remedy
of Defects:











1.


Builder
shall remedy, at its expense, any defects, against which the Vessel
is
warranted under this Article, by making all necessary repairs or
replacements at the Shipyard within thirty (30) days of receipt of
notice
in accordance with Article IX(B)
above.











2.


However,
if it is impractical to bring the Vessel to the Shipyard, Buyer may
cause
the necessary repairs or replacements to be made elsewhere which
is deemed
suitable for the purpose, provided that, in such event, Builder may
forward or supply replacement parts or materials to the Vessel, unless
forwarding or supplying thereof to the Vessel would impair or delay
the
operation or working schedule of the Vessel. In the event that Buyer
proposes to cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made
to the
Vessel at any other shipyard or works than the Shipyard, Buyer shall
first, but in all events as soon as possible, give Builder notice
in
writing of the time and place such repairs will be made, and if the
Vessel
is not thereby delayed, or her operation or working schedule is not
thereby impaired, Builder shall have the right to verify by its own
representative(s) the nature and extents of the defects complained
of.
Builder shall, in such case, promptly advise Buyer by written notice,
after such examination has been completed, of its acceptance or rejection
of the defects as ones that are covered by the warranty herein provided.
Upon Builder’s acceptance of the defects as justifying remedy under this
Article, or upon such final decision by a competent court, Builder
shall
immediately pay to Buyer for such repairs or replacements a sum equal
to
the reasonable cost of making the same repairs or replacements in
the
Shipyard.











3.


In
any case, the Vessel shall be taken at Buyer’s cost, risk and
responsibility to the place elected, ready in all respects for such
repairs or replacements. However, notwithstanding any other provisions
herein this Contract, all reasonable costs incurred by the Buyer
to repair
defective work discovered within the Warranty Period shall be for
Builder’s account.











4.


Any
dispute under this Article shall be referred to dispute resolution
in
accordance with the provisions of Article XIII
hereof.











D.


Extent
of Builder’s Responsibility:











1.


Builder
shall have no responsibility or liability for any other defects whatsoever
in the Vessel than the defects specified in Article IX(A). Nor shall
Builder in any circumstances be responsible or liable for any
consequential, incidental or special losses, damages or expenses
including, but not limited to, loss of time, loss or breach of charters
or
other contractual commitments, loss of profit or earning or demurrage
directly or indirectly occasioned to Buyer by reason of the defects
specified in Article A of this Article or due to repairs or other
works
done to the Vessel to remedy such
defects.











2.


Builder
shall not be responsible for repairing any part of the Vessel which
was,
subsequent to delivery of the Vessel, modified by any other contractor
(and said modification necessitated the repairs), or for any defects
which
have been caused or aggravated by improper use and maintenance of
the
Vessel on the part of Buyer, its servants or agents, or by ordinary
wear
and tear, the negligence or abuse of Buyer or the Vessel’s crew, or by any
other circumstances whatsoever beyond the control of
Builder.











3.


The
warranty contained in this Article replaces and excludes any other
liability, guarantee, warranty and/or condition imposed or implied
by the
law, statutory or otherwise, by reason of the construction and sale
of the
Vessel for and to Buyer. BUILDER MAKES NO FURTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS
OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF
THE
VESSEL, ITS MACHINERY OR EQUIPMENT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
ALL SUCH
FURTHER WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED. FURTHERMORE, BUILDER SHALL
HAVE
NO LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR MANUFACTURER'S
STRICT LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE OR SALE
OF THE
VESSEL.















ARTICLE
X - BUILDER’S DEFAULT






A.


Default
by Builder:









Builder
shall be in default hereunder if Builder:






1.


fails
to perform any material duty imposed upon it by this Contract, which
default Builder does not cure to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer
within fifteen (15) business days’ written notice thereof from
Buyer.











2.


makes
a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, files a petition
in
voluntary bankruptcy or a petition for reorganization or for other
relief
under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, files a petition at common
law or

of a receiver of Builder’s assets, whether temporary or permanent, or
seeks relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, which petition
shall
not have been dissolved within a period of fifteen (15) days from
the date
of the filing of the petition in that
court.














B.


Remedies
for Builder’s Default:











1.


If
Buyer asserts that Builder is in default hereunder and Builder does
not
dispute such assertion and does not remedy same within the respective
cure
periods, Buyer may terminate this Contract. If
Buyer
terminates this Contract pursuant to this Article X(B)(1), Buyer
may
require Builder to deliver possession of the Vessel and all of its
equipment to Buyer, in whatever states of completion the same may
be at
the date of such election. If Buyer elects to take possession of
the
Vessel as aforesaid, then Buyer may bring such workers and subcontractors
to the Shipyard as Buyer chooses and perform such work as may be
necessary
to remove the Vessel from the Shipyard to another location for completion
or disposal. If Buyer elects to complete the Vessel in the Shipyard,
Builder shall be obligated to fully cooperate with Buyer and make
the
Shipyard and workers available to Buyer for the purpose of completing
the
Vessel. In the event Buyer elects to remove the Vessel from the Shipyard,
Builder shall be obligated to fully cooperate with Buyer and make
the
Shipyard and workers available to Buyer for the purpose of sufficient
completion of the Vessel for removal from the Shipyard. Buyer may
thereafter contract with or employ any other person or persons to
complete
the Vessel or any part thereof and provide any equipment, materials
and
labor as may be necessary for such
completion.











2.


If
Buyer terminates this Contract because of Builder’s default and if the
unpaid portion of the Contract Price exceeds Buyer’s Expense, Buyer will
pay the excess amount to Builder. If Buyer’s Expense exceeds the unpaid
balance of the Contract Price, Builder shall pay the difference to
Buyer,
provided, however, such difference shall not exceed twenty percent
(20%)
of the Contract Price. Buyer’s Expense is the sum of the following: (i)
progress and change order payments made until the date of termination,
(ii) Builder’s cost for the performance of the mutually agreed scope of
work necessary to remove the Vessel(s) and/or assist in their completion,
and (iii) Buyer’s cost to complete the construction of the
Vessel(s).












ARTICLE
XI - BUYER’S DEFAULT






A.


Default
by Buyer:









Buyer
shall be in default if Buyer:

not
have been dissolved within a period of ten (10) days from the date
of the
filing of the petition in that
court.











B.


Remedies
for Buyer’s Default:











In
the event of Buyer’s default, Builder shall retain the hull of the Vessel
and all payments as liquidated damages, which shall, however, not
limit
Builder's recovery against Buyer for any damages Builder has suffered
by
reason of such default in excess of the value of such payments, provided,
however, that Builder shall have a duty to mitigate its damages and
shall
reimburse Buyer for such payments received from Buyer to the extent
it
recoups such payments from the sale of the Vessel to a third party,
less
reasonable costs (including litigation costs and attorney fees) incurred
by Builder to make the sale.












ARTICLE
XII - INSURANCE






A.


Extent
of Insurance Coverage:











From
the time the first material destined for inclusion as a part of the
Vessel
becomes at risk at the Shipyard and until the same is completed,
delivered
to and accepted by Buyer, Builder shall, at its own cost and expense,
keep
the Vessel and all machinery, materials, equipment, appurtenances
and
outfit delivered to the Shipyard for the Vessel or built into, or
installed in or upon the Vessel, including Buyer’s Supplies, fully insured
with reputable insurance companies with coverage corresponding to
the
American Institute Builder’s Risk Clauses (dated February 8,
1979).








The
amount of such insurance coverage shall, up to the date of delivery
of the
Vessel, be in an amount at least equal to, but not limited to, the
aggregate of the payment made by the Buyer to Builder including the
value
of Buyer’s Supplies. The policy referred to hereinabove shall be taken out
in the name of Builder and all losses under such policy shall be
payable
to Builder. Upon Buyer’s request, the Builder shall provide a copy of the
insurance policy or insurance certificate evidencing coverage to
Buyer.








If
Buyer so requests, Builder shall, at Buyer’s cost, procure insurance on
the Vessel and all parts, materials, machinery and equipment intended
therefor against risks of earthquake, strikes, war peril or other
risks
not heretofore provided and shall make all arrangements to that end.
The
cost of such insurance shall be reimbursed to Builder by the Buyer
upon
delivery of the Vessel.








B.


Application
of Recovered Amount:











1.


Partial
Loss:











In
the event the Vessel shall be damaged by any insured cause whatsoever
prior to acceptance thereof by the Buyer and in the further event
that
such damage shall not constitute an actual or a constructive total
loss of
the Vessel, Builder shall apply the amount recovered under the insurance
policy referred to in Article XII(A) to the repair of such damage
satisfactory to the Classification Society, and Buyer shall accept
the
Vessel under the Contract if completed in accordance with this Contract
and Specifications.








2.


Total
Loss:











However,
in the event that the Vessel is determined to be an actual or constructive
total loss, Builder shall, by the mutual agreement between the parties
hereto, either:











a.


Proceed
in accordance with the terms of this Contract, in which case the
amount
recovered under said insurance policy shall be applied to the
reconstruction of the Vessel’s damage, provided the parties hereto shall
have first agreed in writing to such reasonable postponement of the
Delivery Date and adjustment of other terms of this Contract including
the
Contract Price as may be necessary for the completion of such
reconstruction; or











b.


Refund
immediately to Buyer the amount of all milestone payments paid to
Builder
under this Contract without any interest, whereupon this Contract
shall be
deemed to be rescinded and all rights, duties, liabilities and obligations
of each of the parties to the other shall terminate
forthwith.











If
the parties hereto fail to reach such agreement within two (2) months
after the Vessel is determined to be an actual or constructive total
loss,
the provisions of Article XII(B)(2)(b) shall
apply.











C.


Termination
of Builder’s Obligation to Insure:











Builder’s
obligation to insure the Vessel hereunder shall cease and terminate
forthwith upon delivery thereof and acceptance by the
Buyer.

designated by Builder.











2.


In
order to facilitate installation by Builder of Buyer’s Supplies in or on

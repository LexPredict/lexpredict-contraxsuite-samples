assigns to COMPANY all worldwide patents, patent applications, copyrights, mask

any and any rights to claim authorship of an Invention to object to or prevent

construed to supersede or limit, any other obligations of GALLOP under any law
or agreement with respect to confidentiality of Company proprietary information
or ownership of the Company's property or proprietary rights.

the subject matter hereof; that he has not transferred, hypothecated, assigned,

has the sole right and exclusive authority to execute this Agreement;

payments provided for in this Agreement, GALLOP and COMPANY, for themselves,
their heirs, assigns,

employees, agents, executors, predecessors and successors in interest, hereby
release and forever discharge each other from any and all claims, demands,
actions or causes of action arising from or in any way connected with GALLOP'S
employment with COMPANY, the terms and conditions of such employment or the
cessation of such employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of
this paragraph will not affect the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement, the Option, that certain Indemnification Agreement between COMPANY
and GALLOP or that certain option to purchase 35,000 shares of Common Stock
granted to GALLOP by COMPANY, any obligation of GALLOP under any law or
agreement with respect to confidentiality of Company proprietary information or
ownership of the Company's property or proprietary rights or any cause of action
arising from fraud or willful misconduct.

(b) GALLOP and COMPANY acknowledge that they may have sustained damage or
possess claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement of which they
are presently unaware.  Having taken such possibility into account, however, in
entering into this Agreement, GALLOP and COMPANY expressly waive the benefits of
California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides:

not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
settlement with the debtor.

be void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining portions of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the meaning of such
provisions harmonized to give effect to this Agreement as if the offending
clause, provision or term were not included in this Agreement.

EXHIBIT B

SECTION 2870, CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE

Section 2870 of the California Labor Code states as follows:  ANY PROVISION IN
AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES THAT AN EMPLOYEE SHALL ASSIGN, OR OFFER
TO ASSIGN, ANY OF HIS OR HER RIGHTS IN AN INVENTION TO HIS OR HER EMPLOYER SHALL
NOT APPLY TO AN INVENTION THAT THE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPED ENTIRELY ON HIS OR HER OWN
TIME WITHOUT USING THE EMPLOYER'S EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, FACILITIES, OR TRADE
SECRET INFORMATION EXCEPT FOR THOSE INVENTIONS THAT EITHER:  (1) RELATE AT THE
TIME OF CONCEPTION OR REDUCTION TO PRACTICE OF THE INVENTION TO THE EMPLOYER'S
BUSINESS, OR ACTUALLY OR DEMONSTRABLY ANTICIPATED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT OF THE
EMPLOYER, OR (2) RESULT FROM ANY WORK PERFORMED BY THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE
EMPLOYER.  TO THE EXTENT A PROVISION IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT PURPORTS TO
REQUIRE AN EMPLOYEE TO ASSIGN AN INVENTION OTHERWISE EXCLUDED FROM BEING
REQUIRED TO BE ASSIGNED UNDER CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2870(a), THE
PROVISION IS AGAINST THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THIS STATE AND IS UNENFORCEABLE.

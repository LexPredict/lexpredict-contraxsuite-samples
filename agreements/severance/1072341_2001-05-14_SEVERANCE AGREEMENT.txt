WHEREAS, the Executive is a senior executive or key employee of the
Company and has made and is expected to continue to make major contributions to

Company;

WHEREAS, the Company recognizes that, as is the case for most
publicly-held companies, the possibility of a Change in Control exists;

future continuity of management and desires to establish certain minimum

employees, including the Executive, applicable in the event of a Change in
Control;

WHEREAS, the Company wishes to ensure that its senior executives and
other key employees are not practically disabled from discharging their duties
in respect of a proposed or actual transaction involving a Change in Control;

(as such term is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) by

the date of an occurrence of a Change in Control and continuing until the

written notice to the other that the Severance Period is not to be so

Executive, as the case may be, does not wish to have the Term extended,

reason to be an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, thereupon
without further action the Term shall be deemed to have expired and this
Agreement will immediately terminate and be of no further effect. For
purposes of this Section 1(g), the Executive shall not be deemed to have

quantifiable and objective financial goals.

2. Operation of Agreement: This Agreement will be effective and
binding immediately upon its execution, but, anything in this Agreement to, the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement will not be operative unless and until
a Change in Control occurs, whereupon without further action this Agreement
shall become immediately operative.

3. Termination Following a Change in Control:

(1) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
Executive's employment may be terminated by the Company during the
Severance Period and the Executive shall not be entitled to the benefits
provided by Section 4 only upon the occurrence of one or more of the
following events:

(1) The Executive's death;

(2) If the Executive becomes disabled and begins
actually to receive disability benefits pursuant to the long-term
disability plan in effect for, or applicable to, Executive
immediately prior to the Change in Control; or

(3) Cause.

If, during the Severance Period, the Executive's employment is
terminated by the Company other than pursuant to Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii)
or 3(a)(iii), the Executive will be entitled to the benefits provided by
Section 4 hereof. For purposes of this Agreement, Executive shall be
deemed "disabled" if, by reason of physical or mental disability,
Executive becomes unable to perform the services required of Executive for
more than 120 days in the aggregate (excluding infrequent and temporary
absences due to ordinary transitory illness) during any twelve-month
period.

(2) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
Executive may terminate employment with the Company and any Subsidiary
during the Severance Period with the right to severance compensation as
provided in Section 4 upon the occurrence of one or more of the following


5
<PAGE>

events (regardless of whether any other reason, other than Cause as
hereinabove provided, for such termination exists or has occurred,
including without limitation other employment):

(1) Failure to elect or reelect or otherwise to maintain
the Executive in the office or the position, or a substantially
equivalent office or position, of or with the Company and/or a
Subsidiary, as the case may be, which the Executive held immediately
prior to a Change in Control, or the removal of the Executive as a
Director of the Company (or any successor thereto) if the Executive
shall have been a Director of the Company immediately prior to the
Change in Control;

(2) (I) Executive is assigned duties materially
inconsistent with the authorities, powers, functions, status,
responsibilities or duties attached to the position with the Company
and any Subsidiary which the Executive held immediately prior to the
Change in Control; (II) a reduction in the aggregate of the
Executive's Base Pay and Incentive Pay payable to the Executive by
the Company and any Subsidiary; or (III) the termination or denial
of the Executive's rights to Employee Benefits or a reduction in the
scope or value thereof;

(3) A determination by the Executive (which
determination will be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto
provided such determination is reasonable and has been made in good
faith and in all events will be presumed to be a reasonable
determination made in good faith unless otherwise shown by the
Company by clear and convincing evidence) that a change in
circumstances has occurred following a Change in Control, including
without limitation a change in the scope of the business or other
activities for which the Executive was responsible immediately prior
to the Change in Control, which has rendered the Executive
substantially unable to carry out, has substantially hindered
Executive's performance of, or has caused Executive to suffer a
substantial reduction in, any of the authorities, powers, functions,
responsibilities or duties attached to the position held by the
Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control, which
situation is not remedied within 10 calendar days after


6
<PAGE>

written notice to the Company from the Executive of such
determination;

(4) The liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation
or reorganization of the Company or transfer of all or substantially
all of its business and/or assets, unless the successor or
successors (by liquidation, merger, consolidation, reorganization,
transfer or otherwise) to which all or substantially all of its
business and/or assets have been transferred (directly or by
operation of law) shall have assumed all duties and obligations of
the Company under this Agreement pursuant to Section 10(a);

(5) The Company or any of its Subsidiaries requires the
Executive regularly to perform Executive's duties of employment
beyond a 50-mile radius from the location of Executive's employment
immediately prior to the Change in Control or requires the Executive
to travel away from Executive's office in the course of discharging
Executive's responsibilities or duties hereunder at least 50% more
(in terms of aggregate days in any calendar year or in any calendar
quarter when annualized for purposes of comparison to any prior
year) than was required of Executive in any of the three full years
immediately prior to the Change of Control without, in either case,
Executive's prior written consent.

(3) A termination by the Company pursuant to Section 3(a) or by
the Executive pursuant to Section 3(b) will not affect any rights or
benefits which the Executive may have pursuant to any agreement, policy,
plan, program or arrangement of the Company providing Employee Benefits,
which rights and benefits shall be governed by the terms thereof,
including, without limitation, rights to payments under the Company's
bonus and incentive plans for prior fiscal years which have been earned
but not yet paid to Executive.

4. Severance Compensation:

(1) If, following the occurrence of a Change in Control, the
Company terminates the Executive's employment during the Severance Period
other than pursuant to Section 3(a), or if the Executive terminates
Executive's employment pursuant to Section 3(b), the Company will pay to


7
<PAGE>

the Executive the following amounts within ten business days after the
date (the "Termination Date") that the Executive's employment is
terminated (the effective date of which shall be the date of termination,
or such other date that may be specified by the Executive if the
termination is pursuant to Section 3(b)) and continue to provide to the
Executive the following benefits:

(1) a lump sum cash payment (the "Severance Payment") in
an amount equal to three times the sum of (A) Base Pay, plus (B) the
greater of (x) the average actual bonus earned by the Executive
pursuant to any annual bonus or incentive plan maintained by the
Company in respect of the three fiscal years ending immediately
prior to the fiscal year in which occurs such Change in Control (or,
such lesser number of years during which the Executive was employed
by the Company and annualized in the case of any such bonus paid in
respect of a portion of a fiscal year) and (y) the Targeted Bonus
(determined in accordance with Section 1(h) (the greater of (x) and
(y) being hereinafter referred to as the "Highest Bonus");

(2) for 36 months following the Termination Date (the
"Continuation Period"), the Company will arrange to provide the
Executive with Employee Benefits that are welfare benefits (but not
stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation or similar
compensatory benefits) no less favorable than those which the
Executive was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to
the Termination Date, including benefits provided under the
Company's Executive Protection Plan. If and to the extent that any
benefit described in this Section 4(a)(ii) is not or cannot be paid
or provided under any policy, plan, program or arrangement of the
Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, then the Company will
itself pay or provide for the payment to the Executive, or
Executive's dependents and beneficiaries, of such Employee Benefits.
Without otherwise limiting the purpose or effect of Section 5,
Employee Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to
this Section 4(a)(ii) will be reduced to the extent comparable
welfare benefits are actually received by the Executive from another
employer during the Continuation Period.

(3) Notwithstanding any provision of any annual or
long-term incentive plan to the contrary, the Company shall pay to
the Executive a lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the sum of (x)
any


8
<PAGE>

unpaid incentive compensation which has been allocated or awarded to
the Executive for a completed fiscal year or other measuring period
preceding the Termination Date under any such plan and which, as of
the Termination Date, is contingent only upon the continued
employment of the Executive to a subsequent date, and (y) the
product of the Highest Bonus and a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in the fiscal year in which the Termination
Date occurs prior to the Termination Date and the denominator of
which is 365.

(4) Notwithstanding the terms or conditions of any
awards relating to a grant of restricted shares, all restricted
shares which are not vested as of the Termination Date shall become
fully vested.

(5) The Company shall provide the Executive with
outplacement services suitable to the Executive's position for a
period of three years or, if earlier, until the first acceptance by
the Executive of an offer of employment.

(2) There will be no right of set-off or counterclaim in respect
of any claim, debt or obligation against any payment to or benefit for the
Executive provided for in this Agreement, except as expressly provided in
the last sentence of Section 4(a)(ii).

(3) Without limiting the rights of the Executive at law or in
equity, if the Company fails to make any payment or provide any benefit
required to be made or provided hereunder on a timely basis, the Company
will pay interest on the amount or value thereof at the prime rate in
effect at the First National Bank of Chicago. Such interest will be
payable as it accrues on demand. Any change in such prime rate will be
effective on and as of the date of such change.

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the parties'
respective rights and obligations under this Section 4 and under Sections
6 and 7 will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement
following a Change in Control or the termination of the Executive's
employment following a Change in Control for any reason whatsoever.


9
<PAGE>

5. No Mitigation Obligation: The Company hereby acknowledges that it
will be difficult and may be impossible (a) for the Executive to find reasonably
comparable employment following the Termination Date, and (b) to measure the
amount of damages which Executive may suffer as a result of termination of
employment hereunder. Accordingly, the payment of the severance compensation by
the Company to the Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is
hereby acknowledged by the Company to be reasonable and will be liquidated
damages, and the Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any
payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise,
nor will any profits, income, earnings or other benefits from any source
whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction or any other obligation on
the part of the Executive hereunder or otherwise reduce any payments or benefits
to be provided to Executive hereunder, except as expressly provided in the last
sentence of Section 4(a)(ii).

6. Certain Additional Payments by the Company:

(1) In the event that this Agreement becomes operative and it is
determined (as hereafter provided) that any payment or distribution by the
Company or any of its affiliates to or for the benefit of Executive,
whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other
agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without
limitation any stock option, stock appreciation right or similar right, or
the lapse or termination of any restriction on or the vesting or
exercisability of any of the foregoing (a "Payment"), would be subject to
the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (or any successor provision thereto), or to any similar
tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or penalties with
respect to such excise tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such
interest and penalties, are hereafter collectively referred to as the
"Excise Tax"), then Executive will be entitled to receive an additional
payment or payments (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after
payment by Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties
imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed
upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up
Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

(2) Subject to the provisions of Section 6(f) below, all
determinations required to be made under this Section 6, including whether


10
<PAGE>

an Excise Tax is payable by Executive and the amount of such Excise Tax
and whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up
Payment, will be made by a nationally recognized firm of certified public
accountants (the "Accounting Firm") selected by Executive in Executive's
sole discretion. Executive will direct the Accounting Firm to submit its
determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and
Executive within 15 calendar days after the date of the Change in Control
or the date of Executive's termination of employment, if applicable, and
any other such time or times as may be requested by the Company or
Executive. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment,
the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest
marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the
Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the
highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the
Executive's residence on the Termination Date (or if there is no
Termination Date, then the date on which the Gross-Up Payment is
calculated for purposes of this Section 6(b)), net of the maximum
reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction
of such state and local taxes. If the Accounting Firm determines that any
Excise Tax is payable by Executive, the Company will pay the required
Gross-Up Payment to Executive within five business days after receipt of
such determination and calculations. If the Accounting Firm determines
that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive, it will, at the same time as
it makes such determination, furnish Executive with an opinion that
Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on
Executive's federal, state, local income or other tax return. Any
determination by the Accounting Firm as to the amount of the Gross-Up
Payment will be binding upon the Company and Executive. As a result of the
uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any
successor provision thereto) and the possibility of similar uncertainty
regarding applicable state or local tax law at the time of any
determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that
Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have
been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required
to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts or fails to
pursue its remedies pursuant to Section 6(f) below and Executive
thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, Executive will
direct the Accounting Firm to determine the amount of the Underpayment
that has occurred and to submit its determination and detailed supporting
calculations to both the Company and Executive as promptly as possible.
Any such Underpayment will be promptly paid by the


11
<PAGE>

Company to, or for the benefit of, Executive within five business days
after receipt of such determination and calculations.

(3) The Company and Executive will each provide the Accounting
Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the
possession of the Company or Executive, as the case may be, reasonably
requested by the Accounting Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the
Accounting Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the
determination contemplated by Section 6(b) above.

(4) The federal, state and local income or other tax returns
filed by Executive will be prepared and filed on a consistent basis with
the determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the Excise Tax
payable by Executive. Executive will make proper payment of the amount of
any Excise Tax. If prior to the filing of Executive's federal income tax
return, or corresponding state or local tax return, if relevant, the
Accounting Firm determines that the amount of the Gross-Up Payment should
be reduced, Executive will within five business days pay to the Company
the amount of such reduction.

(5) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for its
services in connection with the determinations and calculations
contemplated by Section 6(b) and (d) above will be borne by the Company.
If such fees and expenses are initially advanced by Executive, the Company
will reimburse Executive the full amount of such fees and expenses within
five business days after receipt from Executive of a statement therefor
and reasonable evidence of Executive's payment thereof.

(6) Executive will notify the Company in writing of any claim by
the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the
payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification will be
given as promptly as practicable, but no later than 10 business days after
Executive actually receives notice of such claim, and Executive will
further apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on
which such claim is requested to be paid (in each case, to the extent
known by Executive). Executive will not pay such claim prior to the
earlier of (i) the expiration of the 30-calendar-day period following the
date on which Executive gives such notice to the Company and (ii) the date
that any payment of amount with respect to such claim is due. If the
Company notifies Executive


12
<PAGE>

in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to
contest such claim, Executive will:

(1) provide the Company with any written records or
documents in Executive's possession relating to such claim
reasonably requested by the Company;

(2) take such action in connection with contesting such
claim as the Company will reasonably request in writing from time to
time, including without limitation accepting legal representation
with respect to such claim by an attorney competent in respect of
the subject matter and reasonably selected by the Company;

(3) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order
effectively to contest such claim; and

(4) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings
relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company will bear and pay directly all
costs and expenses (including interest and penalties) incurred in
connection with such contest and will indemnify and hold harmless
Executive, on an after-tax basis, for and against any Excise Tax or
income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto,
imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and
expenses. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section
6(f), the Company will control all proceedings taken in connection
with the contest of any claim contemplated by this Section 6(f) and,
at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing
authority in respect of such claim (provided that Executive may
participate therein at Executive's own cost and expense) and may, at
its option, either direct Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue
for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and
Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before
any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and
in one or more appellate courts, as the Company will determine;
provided, however, that if the Company directs Executive to pay the
tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Company will advance the
amount of such payment


13
<PAGE>

to Executive on an interest-free basis and will indemnify and hold
Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any excise Tax or
income tax, including interest or penalties with respect thereto,
imposed with respect to such advance; and provided further, however,
that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment
of taxes for the taxable year of Executive with respect to which the
contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such
contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of any such
contested claim will be limited to issues with respect to which a
Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and Executive will be
entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue
raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
authority.

(7) If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount advanced by
the Company pursuant to Section 6(f) above, Executive receives any refund
with respect to such claim, Executive will (subject to the Company's
complying with the requirements of Section 6(f) above) promptly pay to the
Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or
credited thereon after any taxes applicable thereto). If, after the
receipt by Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to
Section 6(f) above, a determination is made that Executive will not be
entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not
notify Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial or refund
prior to the expiration of 30-calendar-days after such determination, then
such advance will be forgiven and will not be required to be repaid and
the amount of such advance will offset, to the extent thereof, the amount
of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid pursuant to this Section 6.

7. Legal Fees and Expenses: If it should appear to the Executive
that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this
Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other person takes or
threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void, invalid or
unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding
designed to deny, or to recover from, the Executive the benefits provided or
intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, the Company irrevocably
authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain counsel of Executive's
choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to advise and
represent the Executive in connection with any such interpretation, enforcement
or defense, including without limitation the initiation or defense of any
litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any
Director,


14
<PAGE>

officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Company, in any
jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client relationship
between the Company and such counsel, the Company irrevocably consents to the
Executive's entering into an attorney-client relationship with such counsel, and
in that connection the Company and the Executive agree that a confidential
relationship shall exist between the Executive and such counsel. The Company
will pay and be solely financially responsible for Executive's out-of-pocket
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by the
Executive in connection with any of the foregoing; provided, however, in the
case of any such litigation or other action or proceeding in which the Company
or any of its affiliates and Executive are adverse parties, the Company shall
not pay or be responsible for any such expenses if the Company or any of its
affiliates prevails against the Executive.

8. Employment Rights; Termination Prior to Change in Control:
Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will create any right or duty on
the part of the Company or the Executive to have the Executive remain in the
employment of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to or following any Change in
Control.

9. Withholding of Taxes: The Company may withhold from any amounts
payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as the
Company is required to withhold pursuant to any law or government regulation or
ruling.

10. Successors and Binding Agreement:

(1) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise)
to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Executive, expressly
to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such
succession had taken place. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including
without limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or
substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by
purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such
successor shall thereafter be deemed the "Company" for the purposes of
this Agreement), but will not otherwise be assignable, transferable or
delegable by the Company.


15
<PAGE>

(2) This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives,
executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees and legatees.

(3) This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the
parties hereto shall, without the consent of the other, assign, transfer
or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except
as expressly provided in Sections 10(a) and 10(b) hereof. Without limiting
the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Executive's right to
receive payments hereunder will not be assignable, transferable or
delegable, whether by pledge, garnishment, creation of a security
interest, claims for alimony, or otherwise, other than by a transfer by
Executive's will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the
event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section
10(c), the Company shall have no liability to pay any amount so attempted
to be assigned, transferred or delegated.

11. Notices: For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications,
including without limitation notices, consents, requests or approvals, required
or permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have
been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by electronic facsimile

or (ii) Employee's employment is terminated by reason of Constructive
Termination, Employee shall be entitled to the following compensation and
benefits:

2.01  Base Salary and Bonus. PPD shall pay Employee an amount equal to
(see Exhibit A) times the sum of Employee's (i) base salary for the First Period

for less than the First Period) and (ii) the greater of (x) Employee's target

Date, PPD shall continue to pay for and provide welfare benefits which Employee
was receiving immediately prior to the Termination Date, including life
insurance, health, medical, dental, vision and wellness, accidental death and
dismemberment and disability benefits; provided, however, that PPD's obligations
under this clause shall terminate from the date that Employee first becomes
eligible after the Termination Date for similar coverage under another
employer's plan.

agreement for Stock Awards, (i) all unvested shares underlying Stock Awards
granted more than six months prior to the Termination Date shall become fully

<PAGE>

agreement evidencing a Stock Award as if Employee was an employee of PPD until
the first to occur of (x) the third anniversary of the Termination Date, or (y)
the expiration of the exercise period provided for therein; provided, however,
in the event of Employee's death or his disability (as disability is defined in
the award agreement) after the Termination Date, the time for exercise after
death or such disability prescribed in the award agreement shall apply. The
provisions of this Section 2.04 shall also apply to any and all substitute
awards for nonqualified stock options and restricted stock granted to Employee
in exchange for Stock Awards to which this section applies.

2.05  Limitation on Payments.

a.   Application of Section 2.05. If a Covered Payment hereunder
would be an Excess Parachute Payment and would thereby subject Employee to the
Excise Tax, the provisions of this Section 2.05 shall apply to determine the
amounts payable to Employee pursuant to this Agreement.

b.   Calculation of Benefits. At least fifteen (15) days prior
to the Payment Date, PPD shall notify Employee of the aggregate present value of
all amounts and benefits to which Employee would be entitled under this
Agreement and any other plan, program or arrangement with PPD as of the
Termination Date, together with the projected maximum payments, determined as of
such Date of Termination, that could be paid without Employee being subject to
the Excise Tax.

c.   Imposition of Payment Cap. If (i) the aggregate value of
all amounts and benefits to which Employee would be entitled under this
Agreement and any other plan, program or arrangement with PPD exceeds the amount
which can be paid to Employee without Employee incurring an Excise Tax and (ii)
Employee would receive a greater net after-tax amount (taking into account all
applicable taxes payable by Employee, including an Excise Tax) by applying the
limitation contained in this Section 2.05(c), then the amounts otherwise payable
to Employee under this Section 2 shall be reduced to an amount equal to the
Payment Cap. If Employee receives reduced payments and benefits hereunder,
Employee shall have the right to designate which of the payments and benefits
otherwise provided for in this Agreement that Employee will receive in
connection with the application of the Payment Cap.

d.   Application of Code Section 280G. The Executive Consultant
shall determine whether any part of the Covered Payment will be subject to the
Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax. For purposes of such
determination, the Executive Consultant shall take into consideration and be
guided by the following:

(i)  such Covered Payment will be treated as Parachute
Payments and all Parachute Payments in excess of the Base Amount shall be
treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless and except to the extent that in
the good faith judgment of the Executive Consultant, PPD has a reasonable basis
to conclude that such Covered Payment, in whole or in part, either do not
constitute Parachute Payments or represent

4

<PAGE>

reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code) in excess of the Base Amount, or such
Parachute Payments are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and

(ii) the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred
payment or benefit shall be determined by the Executive Consultant in accordance
with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.

(e)  Applicable Tax Rates. For purposes of determining whether
Employee would receive a greater net after-tax benefit if the amounts payable
under this Agreement are reduced in accordance with Section 2.05(c), Employee
shall be deemed to pay:

(i)  federal income taxes at the highest applicable marginal
rate of federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the first amounts
are to be paid hereunder, and

(ii) any applicable state and local income taxes at the
highest applicable marginal rate of taxation for such calendar year, net of the
maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from the
deduction of such state or local taxes if paid in such year;

provided, however, that Employee may request that such determination be made
based on Employee's individual tax circumstances, which shall govern such
determination so long as Employee provides to the Executive Consultant such
information and documents as the Executive Consultant shall reasonably request
to determine such individual circumstances.

(f)  Adjustments in Respect to Payment Cap.

(i)  If Employee receives reduced payments and benefits under
Section 2.05 or if Section 2.05 is determined not to be applicable to Employee
because the Executive Consultant concludes that Employee is not subject to any
Excise Tax, and it is established pursuant to a Final Determination that,
notwithstanding the good faith of Employee and PPD in applying the terms of this
Agreement, the aggregate Parachute Payments paid to Employee or for Employee's
benefit are in an amount that would result in Employee being subject to an
Excise Tax and Employee would still be subject to the Payment Cap under the
provisions of Section 2.05(c), then the amount in excess of the Payment Cap
shall be deemed for all purposes to be a loan to Employee made on the date of
the receipt of such excess payment, which Employee shall have an obligation to
repay to PPD on demand, together with interest at the AFR, from the date of the
payment hereunder to the date of repayment by Employee.

(ii) If Section 2.05 is not applied to reduce Employee's
entitlements under this Section 2 because the Executive Consultant determines
that

5

<PAGE>

Employee would not receive a greater net after-tax benefit by applying Section
2.05 and it is established pursuant to a Final Determination that,
notwithstanding the good faith of Employee and PPD in applying the terms of this
Agreement, Employee would have received a greater net after-tax benefit by
subjecting Employee's payments and benefits hereunder to the Payment Cap, then
the aggregate Parachute Payments paid to Employee or for Employee's benefit in
excess of the Payment Cap shall be deemed for all purposes a loan to Employee
made on the date of receipt of such excess payments, which Employee shall have
an obligation to repay to PPD on demand, together with interest at the AFR, from
the date of payment hereunder to the date of repayment by Employee.

(iii) If Employee receives reduced payments and benefits by
reason of this Section 2.05 and it is established pursuant to a Final
Determination that Employee could have received a greater amount without
exceeding the Payment Cap, then PPD shall promptly thereafter pay Employee the
aggregate additional amount which could have been paid without exceeding the
Payment Cap, together with interest on such amount at the AFR, from the original
payment due date to the date of actual payment by PPD.

3.       Miscellaneous.

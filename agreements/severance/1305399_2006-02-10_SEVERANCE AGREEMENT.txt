[Subsidiary]
Executive Change-in-Control Severance Agreement



THIS
EXECUTIVE CHANGE-IN-CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT is made, entered into, and is effective
this ___ day of _________, 20__ (hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Date”),

of the valuable services of the Executive to the detriment of the Company and its
shareholders; and



WHEREAS,
both the Company and the Executive are desirous that any proposal for a Change in Control
will be considered by the Executive objectively and with reference only to the business
interests of the Company and its shareholders; and



WHEREAS,
the Executive will be in a better position to consider the Company’s best interests
if the Executive is afforded reasonable security, as provided in this Agreement, against
altered conditions of employment which could result from any such Change in Control.



NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements of

less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced,
constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction
will be made only if and to the extent that such reduction would result in an increase in
the aggregate payments and benefits to be provided, determined on an after-tax basis
(taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any
successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law and
any applicable federal, state, and local income taxes). The determination of whether any
reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided under this Agreement is required
pursuant to the preceding sentence will be made, at the expense of the Company, if
requested by the Executive or the Company, by the Company’s independent accountants.



The
fact that the Executive’s right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of
the limitations contained in this Article 4 will not of itself limit or otherwise affect
any other rights of the Executive other than pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that
any payment or benefit intended to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is
required to be reduced pursuant to this Article 4, the Executive will be entitled to
designate the payments and/or benefits to be so reduced in order to give effect to this
Article 4. The Company will provide the Executive all information reasonably requested by
the Executive to permit the Executive to make such designation. In the event that the
Executive fails to make such designation within ten (10) business days of the Effective
Date of Termination, the Company may effect such reduction in any manner it deems
appropriate.



Article 5. Contractual
Rights and Legal Remedies



5.1
Payment Obligations Absolute. The Company’s obligation to make the payments
and the arrangements provided for herein shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall
not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any offset,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which the Company may have against the
Executive or anyone else. All amounts payable by the Company hereunder shall be paid
without notice or demand.



The
Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the amounts
payable or arrangements made under any provision of this Agreement, and the obtaining of
any such other employment shall in no event effect any reduction of the Company’s
obligations to make the payments and arrangements required to be made under this
Agreement.



5.2
Contractual Rights to Benefits. This Agreement establishes and vests in the
Executive a contractual right to the benefits to which he is entitled hereunder. However,
nothing herein contained shall require or be deemed to require the Company to segregate,
earmark, or otherwise set aside any funds or other assets, in trust or otherwise, to
provide for any payments to be made or required hereunder.



5.3
Arbitration. The Company and the Executive shall have the right and option to elect
(in lieu of litigation) to have any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection
with this Agreement settled by arbitration, conducted before a panel of three (3)
arbitrators (one selected by the Executive, one selected by the Company, and one selected
by the two previously selected arbitrators) sitting in a location selected by the
Executive within fifty (50) miles from the location of his job with the Company, in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The
Company’s or the Executive’s election to arbitrate, as herein provided, and the
decision of the arbitrators in that proceeding, shall be binding on the Company and the
Executive. Judgment may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any court having
jurisdiction.

Article 6. Term of
Agreement



6.1
Term. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in
effect for two (2) full calendar years (through ____________, 20__) (the “Initial
Term”).



The
Initial Term shall be extended automatically for one (1) additional year at the end of the
Initial Term, and then again after each successive one (1) year period thereafter (each
such one (1) year period following the Initial Term a “Successive Period”).
However, the Company may terminate this Agreement entirely at the end of the Initial Term,
or at the end of any Successive Period thereafter, by giving the Executive written notice
of intent not to renew, delivered at least six (6) months prior to the end of such
Initial Term or Successive Period. If such notice is properly delivered by the Company,
this Agreement, along with all corresponding rights, duties, and covenants shall
automatically expire at the end of the Initial Term or Successive Period then in progress.



6.2
Change-in-Control Renewal. In the event that a Change in Control occurs during the
Initial Term or any Successive Period, upon the effective date of such Change in Control,
the term of this Agreement shall automatically and irrevocably be renewed for a period of
twelve (12) full calendar months from the effective date of such Change in Control. This
Agreement shall thereafter automatically terminate following the twelve (12) month Change
in Control renewal period. Further, this Agreement shall be assigned to, and shall be
assumed by the purchaser in such Change in Control, as further provided in Article 7
herein.



Article 7. Successors



7.1
Successors to the Company. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to require any
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, reorganization, consolidation,
acquisition of property or stock, liquidation, or otherwise) of all or a significant
portion of the assets or stock of the Company by agreement, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no
such succession had taken place. Regardless of whether such agreement is executed, this
Agreement shall be binding upon any successor if in accordance with the operation of law
and, if so, such successor shall be deemed the “Company” for purposes of this
Agreement.



7.2
Assignment by the Executive. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Executive’s personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If the Executive
dies while any amount would still be payable to him hereunder had he continued to live,
all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement to the Executive’s devisee, legatee, or other designee,
or if there is no such designee, to the Executive’s estate.



Article 8. Miscellaneous




10









8.1
Employment Status. This Agreement is not, and nothing herein shall be deemed to
create, an employment contract between the Executive and the Company or any entity related
to the Company (within the meaning of Code Section 414(b), (c) or (m)). The Executive
acknowledges that the rights of the Company remain wholly intact to change or reduce at
any time and from time to time his compensation, title, responsibilities, location, and
all other aspects of the employment relationship, or to discharge him prior to a Change in
Control (subject to such discharge possibly being considered a Qualifying Termination
pursuant to Section 2.2).



8.2
Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the Company
and the Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof. In addition, the payments
provided for under this Agreement in the event of the Executive’s separation from
service with the Company for any reason shall be in lieu of any severance benefits payable
under any severance plan, program, or policy of the Company to which the Executive might
otherwise be entitled.



8.3
Notices. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications hereunder shall
be sufficient if in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by
hand or if sent by registered or certified mail to the Executive at the last address he
has filed in writing with the Company or, in the case of the Company, at its principal
offices.



8.4
Conflicting Agreements. This Agreement completely supersedes any and all prior
change-in-control agreements or understandings, oral or written, entered into by and
between the Company and the Executive, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all
amendments thereto, in their entirety. Further, the Executive hereby represents and
warrants to the Company that his entering into this Agreement, and the obligations and
duties undertaken by him hereunder, will not conflict with, constitute a breach of, or
otherwise violate the terms of, any other employment or other agreement to which he is a
party, except to the extent any such conflict, breach, or violation under any such
agreement has been disclosed to the Board in writing in advance of the signing of this
Agreement.



8.5
Includable Compensation. Severance Benefits provided hereunder shall not be
considered “includable compensation” for purposes of determining the
Executive’s benefits under any other plan or program of the Company unless otherwise
provided by such other plan or program.



8.6
Tax Withholding. The Company shall withhold from any amounts payable under this
Agreement all federal, state, city, or other taxes as legally required to be withheld.



8.7
Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal or
invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts
of the Agreement, and the Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or
invalid provision had not been included. Further, the captions of this Agreement are not
part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force and effect.



Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall have no
obligation to make any payment to the Executive hereunder to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such payment is prohibited by the terms of any final order of a federal or
state court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that such
an order shall not affect, impair, or invalidate any provision of this Agreement not
expressly subject to such order.




11









8.8
Modification. No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged
unless such modification, waiver, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the
Executive and on behalf of the Company, as applicable, or by the respective parties’
legal representatives or successors.



8.9
Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine
term used herein shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the
singular shall include the plural.



8.10
Applicable Law. To the extent not preempted by the laws of the United States, the
laws of Wisconsin shall be the controlling law in all matters relating to this Agreement
without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws.

SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AND RELEASE
BETWEEN
DUCK HEAD APPAREL COMPANY, INC.
and
WILLIAM B. MATTISON
================================================================================


A. INTRODUCTION

William B. Mattison is a salaried employee working in Duck Head Apparel
Company, Inc. Because of business conditions, Duck Head Apparel Company, Inc. is
conducting a reduction in force among all salaried employees assigned to Duck
Head Apparel Company, Inc. and among all salaried home office personnel assigned
to Delta Merchandising, Inc. As part of this reduction in force, William B.
Mattison's employment ended on March 29, 2001, which is the employee's "Release
Date." In this Agreement, "Employee" means William B. Mattison, and "Duck Head
Apparel" means Duck Head Apparel Company, Inc. The purpose of this Severance
Agreement and Release (the "Agreement") is to state the conditions of Employee's
termination and to resolve any dispute that might exist between Employee and
Duck Head Apparel.

B. SEVERANCE PAY FOR THE 2001 SALARIED REDUCTION IN FORCE

Duck Head Apparel maintains a "Severance Plan for Salaried Employees of
Duck Head Apparel Company, Inc.," (the "Severance Plan") for salaried employees
whose employment terminates under certain conditions. Under this Severance Plan,
an eligible, salaried employee receives certain benefits in return for the
employee signing a release as required by the Severance Plan. If the release is
signed, an eligible employee receives a severance benefit of two (2) weeks of
base pre-termination salary, plus one (1) week for each full year of Service
Credit.

(The severance benefit is capped at a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks'
pay and is calculated based upon the employee's base salary at the time of
termination. Any service credit for a partial year of service in excess of six
months shall be rounded to the next highest year.)

Duck Head Apparel has decided to exercise its discretion under the
Severance Plan to offer Employee an extended severance benefit in excess of that
to which the Employee is otherwise entitled under the Severance Plan provided,
however, the Employee agrees to modify the parties' Severance Protection
Agreement, dated November 3, 2000 ("Severance Protection Agreement") to allow a
setoff of the severance pay pursuant to this Agreement against the employee's
severance entitlement pursuant to the Severance Protection Agreement. In
consideration of this modification, Duck Head Apparel agrees to extend the
Employee's severance from 4 weeks' entitlement, or $8,480.00, to 26 weeks, or
$55,120.00. In further consideration of this modification, Duck Head Apparel
also agrees to provide the Employee with an additional 26 weeks, or $55,120.00,
severance benefit if there is a "Change in Control" as defined in the Severance
Protection Agreement between the 61st and 180th day following the Employee's
Release Date. This Severance Agreement and Release is the release Employee must
sign to receive this severance benefit.

C. DUCK HEAD APPAREL'S PROMISES TO EMPLOYEE

In return for the promises of Employee contained in this Agreement,
Duck Head Apparel promises to do the following:

(1)      Duck Head Apparel will pay Employee a severance benefit in the
amount of $55,120.00, which represents 26 weeks of Employee's
salary, payable by continuation of Employee's salary until
Employee's severance benefit is exhausted. Payments will be
made to Employee on or after Employee's customary pay days.
Employee will start receiving checks for these payments after

benefit in the amount of $55,120.00, which represents an

benefit is exhausted if, between the 61st and 180th day
following Employee's termination, there is a "Change in
Control" as defined in the Severance Protection Agreement.
These payments will be made to Employee on or after Employee's
customary pay days.

D. EMPLOYEE'S PROMISES TO DUCK HEAD APPAREL

In exchange for the promises of Duck Head Apparel contained in this
Agreement, Employee promises to do the following:

(1)      Employee releases and discharges Duck Head Apparel, any
predecessor corporations, any successor corporations, any

Re:      2001 Duck Head Apparel Salaried Reduction in Force

Dear Billy:

As you have been informed, Duck Head Apparel Company, Inc. (Duck Head
Apparel) is conducting a reduction in force among all salaried employees
assigned to Duck Head Apparel, Inc. and among salaried home office personnel
assigned to Delta Merchandising, Inc. The company made this decision because of
the current financial condition of the company. Your employment with Duck Head
Apparel ended as a result of this reduction in force.

While we are sorry that this has occurred, we are pleased to tell you
that Duck Head Apparel will offer a severance package during this reduction in
force. As a result of your termination, you are potentially eligible under the
Severance Plan for Salaried Employees of Duck Head Apparel Company, Inc. (the
Plan) for a severance benefit equal to two weeks of your base pre-termination
salary, plus one week of your base pre-termination salary for each year of
service with the company. (The severance benefit is capped at twenty-six (26)
week's salary. Your base pre-termination salary is your base salary immediately
before termination, exclusive of bonuses, overtime pay, commissions, and other
similar payments.) You are also potentially eligible for an extended severance
benefit as set forth in the Severance Agreement described below. Duck Head
Apparel will make the required deductions for state and federal taxes, FICA,
etc. from your benefit amount.

In accordance with the terms of the Plan, you must sign a Severance
Agreement and Release with the company in order to receive the severance
benefit. With this Agreement, you will release all claims against Duck Head
Apparel, any associated companies, all their employees, directors, and so forth.
This includes claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

We have attached a copy of the Agreement with this letter for your
review. The Agreement is an important legal document, and we want to make sure
that you understand it:

o We advise you to consult with an attorney prior to signing the Agreement.

o                 Please make sure that you fully understand the Agreement and
what it does. To put it simply, by signing the Agreement, you
give up all rights you would have to sue the company for any
claim you have against the company at the time of signing.
<PAGE>

o                 The Agreement also waives any claims that you have for age
discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

o                 We attempted to write the Agreement in plain language. If you
do not understand it, please let us know at once. To answer
any questions about the Agreement or what it means, you should
talk with your attorney or anyone else whose advice you
respect.

o                 Federal law requires that we provide you with certain
information about this severance offer. This information is
enclosed as Attachment A to the Agreement.

o                 You have forty-five (45) days to consider the Agreement and
decide whether you want to sign it or not. If you do sign the
Agreement, please provide it to me. You then will have seven
(7) days following the date that you signed the Agreement to
revoke it. In fact, the Agreement does not become effective or
enforceable until the seven (7) day revocation period has
expired.

o                 If you do choose to revoke the Agreement, you must inform me
in writing prior to the expiration of the revocation period.

Once again, if you have any questions regarding this letter or the
enclosed Agreement, please get in touch with your attorney or me immediately. We
wish you the best in the future.

Sincerely,


/s/ Charles Mason

Dear Billy:

This letter is to inform you that in recognition of your service to
Duck Head Apparel Company, Inc. (the "Company"), the Compensation Grants
Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors has provided for the
modification of the terms of the Incentive Stock Award Agreement dated August 1,
2000 (the "Incentive Agreement") and the Stock Option Agreements dated July 31,
2000 and September 8, 2000 (the "Option Agreements") entered into by and between
you and the Company. The modifications described herein are contingent upon the
execution of that certain proposed Severance Agreement and Release by and
between the Company and William B. Mattison regarding your release from
employment with the Company effective March 29, 2001 (the "Release Agreement").
The modifications to the Incentive Agreement and Option Agreements described
herein will become effective only if and when the Release Agreement has been
fully executed by all parties thereto and has become irrevocable.

On August 1, 2000, you vested with respect to 2,000 of the 10,000
shares subject to the Incentive Agreement. Under the original terms of the
Incentive Agreement, the remaining 8,000 unvested shares would be forfeit due to
your termination of employment. Contingent upon execution of the Release
Agreement, the Committee has modified the terms of the Incentive Agreement to
provide that you will vest with respect to an additional 3,000 shares under the
Incentive Agreement effective as of the date that the fully executed Release
Agreement becomes irrevocable. The remaining 5,000 shares will still be forfeit
as a result of your termination of employment.

Section G. of the original Option Agreements provides that the stock
options described therein would expire within a specified period after your
termination of employment with the Company. Contingent upon execution of the
Release Agreement, the Committee has modified the terms of the Option Agreements
to delete Section G. from each Agreement in its entirety.

Except as expressly described herein, the terms and conditions of the
Incentive Agreement and the Option Agreements will remain unchanged, and your
incentive stock and stock option awards will remain subject to the terms of the
Company's Incentive Stock Award Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan.

Sincerely,


/s/ K. Scott Grassmyer

2. In the
event (a) the Employee is terminated by the Company for any reason other than
Cause, death or Disability or (b) the Employee resigns for Good Reason, in each
case, prior to the third anniversary hereof, in addition to the payment of any

Internal Revenue Code and its regulations and other guidance (“Section 409A”)),
any payment that would otherwise be made pursuant to this Section 2 during the
six-month period beginning on the date of termination of employment that
constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section
409A shall be accrued and paid on the date that is six months and one day after
the date of Employee’s “separation of service” with the Company (within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code) or, if earlier, the Employee’s date of
death, and no interest or other adjustments shall be made to reflect the delay
in payment.




3. In the
event of termination for Cause, death or Disability, or resignation for other
than Good Reason, the Company shall be under no obligation other than to provide
payment of any unpaid base salary and accrued and unpaid vacation as of the date
of such termination or resignation; provided, however, that with respect to a
termination for Cause, the Company may withhold any compensation due to Employee
as a partial offset against any damages suffered by the Company as a result of
Employee's actions to the extent permitted by law.




4. In the
event (a) the Employee is terminated by the Company for any reason other than
Cause, death or Disability or (b) the Employee resigns for Good Reason, and such
termination or resignation takes place on or within one (1) year after the
Effective Date of a Change in Control, in addition to the compensation set forth

5. The
availability, if any, of any other benefits shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of the plans and/or agreements under which such benefits are
granted.  The benefits granted under this Agreement are in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other benefits granted to Employee under any
policy, plan and/or agreement.




6.
Employee covenants with the Company as follows (as used in this Section 6,
"Company" shall include the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliates):




(a)
Employee shall not knowingly use for Employee’s own benefit or disclose or
reveal to any unauthorized person, any trade secret or other confidential
information relating to the Company, or to any of the businesses operated by it,
including, without limitation, any customer lists, customer needs, price and
performance information, processes, specifications, hardware, software, devices,
supply sources and characteristics, business opportunities, potential business
interests, marketing, promotional pricing and financing techniques, or other
information relating to the business of the Company, and Employee confirms that
such information constitutes the exclusive property of the
Company.  Such restrictions shall not apply to information which is
generally (i) available in the industry or (ii) disclosed through no fault of
Employee.  Employee agrees that Employee will return to the Company
upon request, but in any event upon termination of employment, any physical
embodiment of any confidential information and/or any summaries containing any
confidential information, in whole in part, in any media.




(b)
During the term of employment, and for a period of one year following (i)
termination of such employment for any reason or (ii) payment of any
compensation by the Company to Employee, including under Section 2 hereof,
whichever occurs later, Employee shall not engage, directly or indirectly (which
includes, without limitation, owning, managing, operating, controlling, being
employed by, giving financial assistance to, participating in or being connected
in any material way with any person or entity), anywhere in the United States in
any activities with the following companies, that include Tree of Life or any of
its subsidiaries, Nature’s Best, C&S Distributors or any other company which
is a direct competitor of the Company with respect to (i) the Company’s
activities on the date hereof and/or (ii) any activities which the Company
becomes involved in during the Employee’s term of employment; provided, however,
that Employee’s ownership as a passive investor of less than three percent (3%)
of the issued and outstanding stock of a publicly held corporation so engaged,
shall not by itself be deemed to constitute such competition. Further, during
such one-year period Employee shall not act to induce any of the Company’s
vendors, customers or employees to take action might be disadvantageous to the
Company or otherwise disturb such party’s relationship with the
Company.




(c)
Employee hereby acknowledges that Employee will treat as for the Company’s sole
benefit, and fully and promptly disclose and assign to the Company without
additional compensation, all ideas, information, discoveries, inventions and
improvements which










4















are based
upon or related to any confidential information protected under Section (a)
herein, and which are made, conceived or reduced to practice by Employee during
Employee’s employment by the Company and within one year following (i)
termination thereof or (ii) payment of any compensation by the company to
Employee, including under Section 2 hereof, whichever occurs
later.  The provisions of this subsection (c) shall apply whether such
ideas, discoveries, inventions, improvements or knowledge are conceived, made or
gained by Employee alone or with others, whether during or after usual working
hours, either on or off the job, directly or indirectly related to the Company’s
business interests (including potential business interests), and whether or not
within the realm of Employee’s duties.




(d)
Employee shall, upon request of the Company, but at no expense to Employee, at
any time during or after employment by the Company, sign all instruments and
documents and cooperate in such other acts reasonably required to protect rights
to the ideas, discoveries, inventions, improve­ments and knowledge referred
to above, including applying for, obtaining and enforcing patents and copyrights
thereon in any and all countries.




(e)
Employee recognizes that the possible restrictions on Employee’s activities
which may occur as a result of Employee’s performance of Employee’s obligations
under this Agreement are required for the reasonable protection of the Company
and its investments, and Employee expressly acknowledges that such restrictions
are fair and reasonable for that purpose.  Employee further expressly
acknowledges that damages alone will be an inadequate remedy for any breach or
violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement, and that the Company, in
addition to all other remedies hereunder, shall be entitled, as a matter of
right, to injunctive relief, including specific performance, with respect to any
such breach or violation or threatened breach or violation, in any court of
competent jurisdiction.  If any of the provisions of this Agreement
are held to be in any respect an unreasonable restriction upon Employee then
they shall be deemed to extend only over the maximum period of time, geographic
area, and/or range of activities as to which they may be
enforceable.  Employee expressly agrees that all payments and benefits
due Employee under this Agreement shall be subject to Employee’s compliance with
the provisions set forth in this Section 6.




(f)
Except with respect to any shorter term as expressly provided herein, this
Section 6 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of Employee’s
relationship with the Company for a period of ten (10) years.




7.  This
Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties hereto. If, for any reason, any provision of this
Agreement is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect any other provision
of this Agreement not held so invalid, and each such other provision shall to
the full extent consistent with law continue in force and effect.  The
Company agrees that in the event of a Change in Control this Agreement shall be
assigned to, accepted and performed in good faith by










5















the
person or persons effecting the Change in Control and any failure to so assign
or accept and perform shall be a breach of this Agreement.  This
Agreement has been executed and delivered in the State of Connecticut, and its
validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement shall be governed by the
laws of said State.  This Agreement contains the entire understanding
between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior agreements, oral or
written, on the subject matter hereof between the Company and Employee, but it
is not intended to, and does not, limit any prior, present or future obligations
of the Employee with respect to confidentiality, ownership of intellectual
property and/or non-competition which are greater than those set forth herein,
including those set forth in the (i) Merger Agreement dated as of October
5, 2007 among the Company, UNFI Merger Sub, Distribution Holdings, Inc., and
Millbrook Distribution Services Inc. (the “Merger Parties”) and (ii) the
Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation Agreement between the undersigned and certain
of the Merger Parties.  For purposes of Section 3 of the
Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation Agreement described above and for no other
purpose, this Agreement shall be deemed to be an employment agreement between
the Employee (referred to in the Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation Agreement as
the “Stockholder”) and the Company.




IN
WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement, intending the
Agreement to become binding and effective as of the date and year first written
above.

Re:    Severance Agreement
Dear ________:
In connection with our offer to employ you in the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Northwest Natural Gas Company, an Oregon corporation (the “Company”), and to induce you to accept this position, the Company agrees to provide you certain severance benefits in the event your employment with the Company is terminated under the circumstances described below.
1.    Cash Severance Benefit.  Subject to Section 4, if the Company terminates your employment without Cause (as defined below) on or before June 30, 2020, the Company shall pay to you in a single payment an amount in cash equal to a percentage of your annual base salary in effect on the date of termination determined as follows: 100% of your salary if your date of termination is on or before June 30, 2016, 80% of your salary if your date of termination is on or before June 30, 2017, 60% of your salary if your date of termination is on or before June 30, 2018, 40% of your salary if your date of termination is on or before June 30, 2019, and 20% of your salary if your date of termination is on or before June 30, 2020.
2.    Cause.  Termination by the Company of your employment for “Cause” shall mean termination upon (a) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your assigned duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which such executive believes that you have not substantially performed your duties or (b) the willful engaging by you in illegal conduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.  For purposes of this Section 2, no act, or failure to act, on your part shall be considered “willful” unless done, or omitted to be done, by you in knowing bad faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by you in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.
3.    Benefit Exclusions.  No benefits shall be provided to you under this Agreement if (a) you terminate your employment with the Company whether or not you believe you have good reason for such termination, (b) you become entitled to the benefits described in Section 5(iii) of the Change in Control Severance Agreement between you and the Company, or (c) your employment terminates as a result of your death or your Disability (as defined in the Change in Control Severance Agreement).
4.    Release and Payment.  In consideration for and as a condition precedent to receiving the severance benefits outlined in this Agreement, you agree to execute a release of claims substantially in the









form attached as Exhibit A (the “Release”).  You agree to execute and deliver the Release to the Company within the later of (a) 21 days after the date you receive the Release or (b) the last day of your employment.  Any payments required under this Agreement will be payable only after receipt by the Company of your signed Release and expiration of any required revocation period, and the Company shall not be obligated to make any payments if you do not deliver the signed Release within the time period specified in this Section 4.
5.    Successors; Binding Agreement.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to your estate.
6.    Notice.  For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid and addressed to the address of the respective party set forth on the first page of this Agreement, provided that all notices to the Company shall be directed to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, with a copy to the Secretary of the Company, or to such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.
7.    Miscellaneous.  No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed by you and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement.  The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Oregon.
8.    Validity.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
9.    Arbitration.  Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in Portland, Oregon by three arbitrators in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  Judgment may be entered on the arbitrators’ award, which award shall be a final and binding determination of the dispute or controversy, in any court having jurisdiction.
10.    Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

1.
Confidentiality and Ownership of Company Information.  You agree and acknowledge that during the course of your employment you had access to certain information not generally known to the public relating to business plans or strategic plans of the Company; technology, trade secrets, processes, work in progress or other proprietary information that derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and any other confidential or proprietary information concerning the Company or its affiliates.  You further agree that all such information is and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company whether or not such information was conceived or developed by the Company or you. You agree that you will not at any time use, disclose or in any way allow the use or disclosure of any such information, without the prior written permission of the Company.





2.
Nondisparagement.  Except as otherwise required by law, you agree that you will not publish any statement (orally, in writing or in any other form), or participate in the making











of any statement which is disparaging or detrimental in any way to the Company, its services, affairs or operations.



3.
Equitable Relief.  You acknowledge that in the event you breach any of the provisions of Paragraph 7, the Company will suffer irreparable injury because money damages would be inadequate to safeguard the Company’s protectible interests.  In the event of an actual or threatened breach of any of these provisions, you consent to the granting, by any court having jurisdiction and without the necessity of proving actual monetary loss, of an injunction or other equitable relief enjoining any breach of the above-referenced provisions.  You further agree that the prevailing party in any action to enforce Paragraph 7 of this Release shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees, including costs of appeal.





8.
Unemployment.  The Company will not contest any claim you may make for unemployment insurance benefits from the State, should you choose to seek such benefits.  You should instruct the State representative to direct any unemployment inquiries to the Human Resources Department.  NW Natural is not responsible for information provided in response to any inquiry that is directed to anyone other than the Human Resources Department.





9.
Return of Company Property.  You agree to return all Company property, including keys, car keys, security cards, and all computer discs, hardware, software and other materials belonging to the Company, and you agree not to retain or attempt to use any Company property.





10.
Review Period.  You understand and acknowledge that you have 21 calendar days to consider this Release before executing it and that you have a period of seven days after execution of this Release in which you may elect to revoke the Release, as further explained in Paragraph 16 below.

You agree to repay any amounts received under the Severance Agreement and to pay the reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and any damages the Company or any Released Parties may incur in the event that an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction determines that you have breached any of the terms of this Release, or that any representation you made in this Release is false.





12.
Entire Agreement.  This Release and the Severance Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Company and you as to their subject matter, and fully supersede any prior agreements or understandings between the parties.

You acknowledge that you have not relied on any representations, promises, or agreements of any kind made to you in connection with your decision to sign this Release, except for those set forth in this document.





13.
Severability.  If any of the provisions of this Release are declared by any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining portion, terms and provisions of this Release shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect in a manner that, as fully as possible, effectuates the intention of the parties to this Release.  Moreover, if one or more of the provisions in this Release, for any reason, shall be held to be excessively broad as to scope or subject to be unenforceable at law, such provision or provisions shall be construed by the appropriate judge or arbitrator by limiting or reducing it or them, so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with the applicable law.














14.
Dispute Resolution.  Any disputes arising in connection with the terms or enforcement of this Release, except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 7 above, shall be resolved by confidential mediation or binding arbitration in accordance with the procedures of the Arbitration Service of Portland or other procedures agreed upon by you and the Company.  In accordance with applicable law, this dispute resolution provision shall not apply to any action challenging the enforceability of this Release under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act.




15.
Applicable Law.  You acknowledge that this Release will be governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, and you agree that this Release will be deemed to have been jointly prepared by you and the Company, and any uncertainty or ambiguity existing herein shall not be interpreted against any party as a preparer, but according to the application of other rules on the interpretation of contracts, if any such uncertainty or ambiguity exists.





16.

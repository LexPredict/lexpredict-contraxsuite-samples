AND
COVENANT NOT TO SUE

THIS RELEASE OF CLAIMS AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE (the "Release") is
executed and delivered by __________________________ (the "Executive"), to
Peoples Energy Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliates (collectively
referred to as the "Company").

In consideration of the agreement by the Company to provide the
Executive with the payments and benefits under the Severance Agreement between
the Executive and the Company dated as of August ____, 2004 (the "Severance
Agreement"), the Executive hereby agrees as follows:

1. Release and Covenant.

The Executive, of his own free volition, forever waives and releases
any and all claims the Executive, his dependents, relatives, heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns has or may have against the Company, its
directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, successors and assigns
(both individually and in their official capacities with the Company) of any
kind or nature whatsoever arising from facts, assertions, circumstances,
omissions or matters occurring on or before the date hereof, including all
claims arising from or relating in any way to the Executive's employment with
the Company or the conclusion of employment (whether such claims are presently
known or hereafter discovered). This release includes, but is not limited to, a
release of any claims in tort or contract, including claims for wrongful
discharge, breach of any employment contract or any other agreement, contract,
practice or policy. In addition to any other claims, the Executive specifically
waives, releases, and covenants not to sue or to file any charges or
administrative actions with respect to any and all claims against the Company
under the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, Title VII (or any other title) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (including
all claims of sex, race, national origin, and religious discrimination), Section
1981 of the Civil Rights Act, the Federal Equal Pay Act, the Illinois Human
Rights Act, the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, the Cook County Human
Rights Ordinance, the City of Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, the Family Medical and Leave Act, or any other
federal, state or local statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or doctrine of
common law or public policy, contract or tort law having any bearing whatsoever
on the terms and conditions of employment or termination of employment. This
Release shall not, however, constitute a waiver of any of the Employee's rights
under the Severance Agreement. The Executive acknowledges that, in his decision
to enter into this Release, he has not relied on any representations, promises
or agreements of any kind, including oral statements by representatives of the
Company, except as set forth in this Release.

2. Due Care.

This Release contains a release of all claims under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") and, therefore, pursuant to the
requirements of the ADEA, the Employee acknowledges that he has been advised (i)
that this release includes, but is not limited

<PAGE>

to, all claims under the ADEA arising up to and including the date of execution
of this release; (ii) to consult with an attorney and or other advisor of his
choosing concerning his rights and obligations under this release; (iii) to
fully consider this release before executing it, and that he has been offered
ample time and opportunity, in excess of 21 days, to do so; and (iv) that this
release shall become effective and enforceable 7 days following execution of
this Release by the Executive, during which 7-day period the Executive may
revoke his acceptance of this Release by delivering written notice to:
Secretary, Peoples Energy Corporation, 130 East Randolph Drive, Chicago,
Illinois 60601.

3. No Assignment of Claims.

The Executive represents and warrants that there has been no
assignment or other transfer of any interest in any claim which the Executive
may have against the Company. The Executive agrees to indemnify and hold the
Company harmless from any liability, claims, demands, damages, cost, expenses
and attorney's fees incurred as a result of any person asserting such assignment
or transfer of any rights or claims under any such assignment or transfer. It is
the intention of the Executive and the Company that this indemnity does not
require payment as a condition precedent to recovery by the Company from the
Executive under this indemnity.

4. Modification and Waiver.

This Release may not be modified or amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the Executive and the Company. No term or condition of this
Release shall be deemed to have been waived, nor shall there be any estoppel
against the enforcement of any provision of this Release except by written
instrument signed by the party charged with such waiver or estoppel. No such
written waiver shall be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated
therein, and each such waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or
condition waived and shall not constitute a waiver of such term or condition for
the future or as to any act other than that specifically waived.

5. Governing Law.

To the extent not governed by federal law, this Release and its
validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to the choice of law
provisions in effect in such State.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive has executed this Release and

CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
PEOPLES ENERGY CORPORATION
AND

THIS CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (the
"Agreement"), dated ______________________ (the "Effective Date"), by and
between Peoples Energy Corporation, including any of its subsidiaries,
affiliates and related entities (the "Company") and
_______________________________________ (the "Executive").

WITNESSETH

WHEREAS, the Executive is an employee of the Company;

WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive have entered into a severance
agreement dated August ____, 2004 (the "Severance Agreement") under which the
Company has covenanted to provide the Executive with certain payments and
benefits in connection with the termination of Executive's employment with the
Company; and

WHEREAS, in consideration of the Company's covenants under the
Severance Agreement, and as a condition precedent to the Executive receiving any
payments or benefits under the Severance Agreement, the Executive has agreed to
execute a confidentiality agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, as a condition precedent, and in consideration of
the covenants by the Company to provide the Executive with the payments and
benefits under the Severance Agreement, the Executive hereby agrees as follows:

1. Confidential Information; Acknowledgement of Legitimate Business
Interest of the Company.

The Executive expressly recognizes and acknowledges that during his
employment with the Company, he became entrusted with, had access to, or gained
possession of confidential and proprietary information, data, documents,
records, materials, and other trade secrets and/or other proprietary business
information of the Company that is not readily available to competitors, outside
third parties and/or the public, including without limitation, information about
(i) current or prospective customers and/or suppliers, (ii) employees, research,
goodwill, production, and prices, (iii) business methods, processes, practices
or procedures; (iv) computer software and technology development, (v) the
Company's hydrocarbon interests and prospects, and (vi) business strategy,
including acquisition, merger and/or divestiture strategies, (collectively or
with respect to any of the foregoing, the "Confidential Information"). Executive
further recognizes and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is the
sole and exclusive property of the Company and that the Company has a legitimate
interest in protecting its Confidential Information.

<PAGE>

2. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information.

Executive agrees that for a period commencing as of the Effective
Date and ending October 1, 2005, he shall keep and retain in confidence all
Confidential Information and will not, without the consent of the Company,
disclose or divulge any Confidential Information obtained during his employment
with the Company to any third party, unless either the Company has either itself
released the Confidential Information into the public domain or the Confidential
Information has clearly become publicly available by means other than the
Company or the Executive. No individual piece of Confidential Information shall
be deemed to have become publicly available merely because other pieces of
Confidential Information shall have become publicly available, and no individual
piece of Confidential Information shall be deemed to have become publicly
available unless all of its substantive provisions shall have become publicly
available. This paragraph 2 shall not prevent Executive from using general
skills and experience developed in positions with the Company or other
employers, or from accepting a position of employment with another company,
firm, or other organization, provided that such position does not require
divulgence or use of the Confidential Information.

3. Cooperation with the Company.

If the Executive receives a subpoena or other judicial or
administrative process demanding that he disclose Confidential Information
("Subpoena"), the Executive agrees that he will promptly notify the Company and
cooperate fully with the Company if the Company elects to challenge or otherwise
resist disclosure of the Confidential Information sought by the Subpoena. Any
such challenge or resistance by the Company shall be at the Company's own
expense. Should the Executive promptly notify the Company of the receipt of a
Subpoena and the Company declines or fails to challenge or resist the Subpoena,
or if after intervention by the Company in the judicial or administrative
process, the Company is unsuccessful in quashing or opposing the disclosure, the
Executive may produce the Confidential Information or respond to the Subpoena as
he deems appropriate.

4. Return of Property.

The Executive understands and agrees that all business information,
files, research, records, memoranda, books, lists and other documents and
tangible materials, including computer disks, and other hardware and software
that he receives during employment, whether confidential or not, are the
property of Employer and that, on or before September 30, 2004, he will deliver
to Employer all such materials, including copies thereof, in his possession or
under his control.

5. Non-Solicitation.

Executive covenants and agrees that for a period commencing as of
the Effective Date and ending October 1, 2005 Executive shall not, directly or
indirectly, solicit, induce, influence, or attempt to induce any employee of the
Company to terminate his employment with, or compete against the Company or any
present or future affiliates of the Company. In particular, and without limiting
the foregoing, the Executive agrees during the period commencing as of the
Effective Date and ending October 1, 2005, the Executive shall not directly or
indirectly attempt to hire any other employee of the Company or otherwise
encourage

<PAGE>

any other employee to leave the employ of the Company, or (ii) advise
or recommend to any other person that they employ or solicit for employment, any
employee of the Company.

6. Equitable Relief.

The Executive acknowledges that the Confidential Information to be
disclosed to the Executive during his employment is of a special and unique
character, and that the breach of any provision of this Agreement, including
without limitation, its non-solicitation provision, will cause the Company
irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, the Company shall be entitled, in
addition to all other remedies available to it, to injunctive and equitable
relief to prevent a breach of any part of this Agreement or to enforce any part
of this Agreement.

7. Assignment.

This Agreement is not assignable, in whole or in part, and shall not
be assigned, by the Executive; and any purported assignment by the Executive
shall be considered null and void. This Agreement is assignable and may be so
assigned by Employer; and this Agreement shall inure to the Benefit of, and
shall be binding upon, any and all successors and assigns of Employer.

8. Entire Understanding.

This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the Company
and the Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof.

9. Severability.

If, for any reason, any one or more of the provisions or part of a
provision contained in this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision or part of a provision of this Agreement
not held so invalid, illegal or unenforceable, and each other provision or part
of a provision shall to the full extent consistent with law continue in full
force and effect.

10. Consolidation, Merger, or Sale of Assets.

If the Company consolidates or merges into or with, or transfers all
or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation, the term "the
Company" as used herein shall include such other corporation and this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect.

11. Notices.

permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given if delivered or mailed, postage prepaid, first class with return
receipt as follows:

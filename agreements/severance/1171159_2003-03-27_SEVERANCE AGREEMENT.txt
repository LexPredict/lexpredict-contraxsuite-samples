purposes of determining the period of continuation coverage to which the
Executive or any of his dependents is entitled pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code (or any successor provision thereto) under any group health plan maintained

agree that the non-compete obligations contained in this Section 4(a) shall
supercede and control over any other similar obligations contained in any other

hereafter, unless otherwise in the public domain other than as a result of
disclosure by the Executive or previously known by the Executive or obtained by
the Executive independent of the Company's confidential information.

(c) The Executive acknowledges that all memoranda, notes, lists,
records, engineering drawings, technical specifications and related documents
and other documents or papers (and all copies thereof) relating to the Company,
including such items stored in computer memories, microfiche or by any other

behalf of the Executive during his employment or made available to the Executive
relating to the Company, its affiliates or any entity which may hereafter become
an affiliate thereof, shall be the property of the Company and shall be
delivered to the Company promptly upon the termination of the Executive's
employment with the Company or at any other



3
<PAGE>

time upon request.

(d) The Executive agrees that any inventions, discoveries,
improvements, ideas, concepts or original works of authorship relating directly
to the Company's businesses, including without limitation, computer apparatus,
programs and manufacturing techniques, whether or not protectable by patent or

Executive alone or jointly with others during the Executive's employment with
the Company shall be the property of and belong exclusively to the Company. The
Executive shall promptly and fully disclose to the Company the origination or
development by the Executive of any such material and shall provide the Company
with any information that it may reasonably request about such material.

(e) During the Restricted Period, the Executive shall not, directly

each of which is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and
remedies available to the Company under law or in equity:

(i) the right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants
specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed
that any breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause
irreparable injury to the Company and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to the Company; and

(ii) the right and remedy to require the Executive to account
for and pay over to the Company all compensation, profits, monies, accruals,

<PAGE>

constituting a breach of the Restrictive Covenants.

Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement, to expressly assume and
agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that
the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place. The Company's failure to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness
of any such succession shall entitle the Executive to terminate his employment
hereunder for Good Reason.

the Executive in connection with the resolution of any dispute or controversy
under or in connection with this Agreement shall be reimbursed by the Company
promptly upon the Executive's incurrence thereof plus interest at ten percent

controversy is finally determined in favor of the Company. Also, until paid, all
past due amounts required to be paid by the Company hereunder shall bear

Exhibit B
to
Severance and Change Of Control Agreement

(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and
except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment
or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether
paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Exhibit B) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or if any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with
respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and
penalties, being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then
the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up
Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes
(including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes),
including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties
imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment,
the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
imposed upon the Payments.

(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) below, all
determinations required to be made under this Exhibit B, including whether and
when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made
by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm designated by the
Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business
days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment,
or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the
Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity
or group effecting a Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another
nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required
hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting
Firm hereunder). The Accounting Firm shall assist the Executive with the
preparation and filing of any income tax return required of the Executive which
relates to the period or periods in which Executive received a Payment or a
Gross-Up Payment. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne
solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this
Exhibit B, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5) days of
the receipt of the Accounting Firm's


i
<PAGE>

determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon
the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application
of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the
Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not
have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent
with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the
Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph (c) below and the Executive
thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm
shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such
Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

(c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim
by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment
by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon
as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after the Executive is
informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of
such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The
Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the thirty
(30)-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to
the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes
with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in
writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such
claim, the Executive shall:

(i) Give the Company any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to such claim,

(ii) Take such action in connection with contesting such claim
as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including,
without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by
an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

(iii) Cooperate with the Company in good faith in order
effectively to contest such claim, and

(iv) Permit the Company to participate in any proceedings
relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and
payment of costs and expenses. Without


ii
<PAGE>

limitation on the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c), the Company shall
control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole
option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and
may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and
sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the
Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any
administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more
appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the
Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an
interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or
penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with
respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided
that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes
for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested
amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.
Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues
with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the
Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other
issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

(d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by
the Company pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the Executive becomes entitled to
receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to
the Company's complying with the requirements of paragraph (c) above) promptly
pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or
credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the
Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to paragraph (c) above,
a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund
with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in
writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration
of thirty (30) days after such determination, then such advance shall be
forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance
shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of any Gross-Up Payment required
to be paid.

agrees to the terms and conditions of Exhibit B attached hereto.

(c) Successors; Binding Agreement. In the event of any merger,
consolidation or transfer of assets, the provision of this Agreement shall bind
and inure to the benefit of the surviving or resulting corporation, or the
corporation to which such assets have been transferred, as the case may be. The
Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business
and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement, to expressly assume and
agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that
the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken
place. The Company's failure to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness
of any such succession shall entitle the Executive to terminate his employment
hereunder for Good Reason.

(d) Attorney's Fees. All reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by
the Executive in connection with the resolution of any dispute or controversy
under or in connection with this Agreement shall be reimbursed by the Company
promptly upon the Executive's incurrence thereof plus interest at ten percent
(10.0%) per annum from the date of any such incurrence; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be obligated to make such payment where the dispute or
controversy is finally determined in favor of the Company. Also, until paid, all
past due amounts required to be paid by the Company hereunder shall bear
interest at a rate of ten percent (10.0%) per annum.

(e) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed, construed,
interpreted, and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the State
of Illinois.

Exhibit B
to
Severance and Change Of Control Agreement

(a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and
except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment
or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether
paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Exhibit B) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or if any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with
respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and
penalties, being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then
the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up
Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes
(including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes),
including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties
imposed with respect thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment,
the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
imposed upon the Payments.

(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) below, all
determinations required to be made under this Exhibit B, including whether and
when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made
by a nationally recognized certified public accounting firm designated by the
Executive (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business
days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment,
or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. In the event that the
Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity
or group effecting a Change of Control, the Executive may appoint another
nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required
hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting
Firm hereunder). The Accounting Firm shall assist the Executive with the
preparation and filing of any income tax return required of the Executive which
relates to the period or periods in which Executive received a Payment or a
Gross-Up Payment. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne
solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this
Exhibit B, shall be paid by the Company to the Executive within five (5) days of
the receipt of the Accounting Firm's


i
<PAGE>

determination. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon
the Company and the Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application
of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the
Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not
have been made by the Company should have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent
with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the
Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to paragraph (c) below and the Executive
thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm
shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such
Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

(c) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim
by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment
by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon
as practicable but no later than ten (10) business days after the Executive is
informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of
such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. The
Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the thirty
(30)-day period following the date on which the Executive gives such notice to
the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes
with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the Executive in
writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such
claim, the Executive shall:

(i) Give the Company any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to such claim,

(ii) Take such action in connection with contesting such claim
as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including,
without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by
an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

(iii) Cooperate with the Company in good faith in order
effectively to contest such claim, and

(iv) Permit the Company to participate in any proceedings
relating to such claim;

provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and
expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and
payment of costs and expenses. Without


ii


<PAGE>

limitation on the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c), the Company shall
control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole
option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and
may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and
sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the
Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any
administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more
appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the
Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive on an
interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or
penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with
respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided
that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes
for the taxable year of the Executive with respect to which such contested
amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.
Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be limited to issues
with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and the
Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other
issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.

(d) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
advanced by the Company pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the Executive becomes
entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall
(subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of paragraph (c)
above) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any
interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the
receipt by the Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to
paragraph (c) above, a determination is made that the Executive shall not be
entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not
notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund
prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after such determination, then such
advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount
of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of any Gross-Up
Payment required to be paid.

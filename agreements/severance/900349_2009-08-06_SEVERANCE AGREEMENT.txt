ELLIS in effecting a smooth transition of the management of PERRY ELLIS with respect to the duties and responsibilities that MR. ROSENGARD performed for PERRY ELLIS. MR. ROSENGARD agrees to make himself available in connection with any request by
PERRY ELLIS regarding matters of which MR. ROSENGARD has personal knowledge or which were within the purview of MR. ROSENGARD’s job responsibilities.
5. No Lawsuits. MR. ROSENGARD promises not to institute or have instituted on his behalf any lawsuit against PERRY ELLIS (as defined in Paragraph 3 hereof) based upon any claim that he is waiving in Paragraph 3 above. This
Agreement is not intended to limit MR. ROSENGARD’s right of access to any government agency, nor MR. ROSENGARD’s right to participate in any investigation by any government agency. However, MR. ROSENGARD agrees that, with respect to the
claims that he is waiving herein, he is waiving not only his right to recover money or other relief in any action that he might institute, but also that he is waiving his right to recover money or other relief in any action that might be brought on
his behalf by any other person or entity, including but not limited to the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other federal, state or local governmental agency or department.
6. No Disparagement. MR. ROSENGARD and PERRY ELLIS promise that they will not disparage each other (as defined in Paragraph 3 hereof). Specifically, MR.

attorney’s fees and costs in any lawsuit or arbitration brought to enforce this Agreement.
8. Adequate Consideration. MR. ROSENGARD
agrees that payment to him of the money pursuant to Paragraph 2 of this Agreement constitutes adequate and ample consideration for the rights and claims that he is waiving under this Agreement and for the obligations imposed upon him by virtue of
this Agreement.
9. Non-Admission. MR. ROSENGARD and PERRY ELLIS agree that neither this Agreement nor the furnishing of the consideration
for MR. ROSENGARD’s waiver of claims shall be deemed or construed at anytime for any purpose as an admission by PERRY ELLIS or MR. ROSENGARD of any liability or unlawful conduct of any kind.
10. Governing Law and Interpretation. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. Its language
shall be construed as whole, according to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against either party.
11. Severability. Should any
provision of this Agreement be declared illegal or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction and cannot be modified to be enforceable, such provision shall immediately become null and void, leaving the remainder of this Agreement in full
force and effect.
12. Entire Agreement; Amendment. Except as expressly set forth herein, and except with regard to those written promises
made by MR. ROSENGARD to PERRY ELLIS in paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of his Employment Agreement with Perry Ellis with respect to confidential information, solicitation of employees, vendors, etc., or competition with PERRY ELLIS, this Agreement

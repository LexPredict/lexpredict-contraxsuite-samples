Dear Tom:







We have made the decision to eliminate your position in our cost reduction initiative which we have been discussing with employees these past few weeks. Unfortunately, this means that your employment with Connecticut Water Company ended effective, September 10, 2010, due to the reduction in force or the reorganization of the Water Treatment and Quality departments.







Tom, you have participated in the following plans and agreements and have earned benefits that will be paid to you per the specific terms of those agreements;











Savings Plan of the Connecticut Water Company – “401(k)"














Connecticut Water Company Employees Retirement Plan














Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Agreement














Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Agreement














2004 Performance Share Plan – Previously Earned and Vested Shares










These benefits are not impacted by your decision to participate in the exit incentive program described next.







In recognition of your accomplishments during your employment, your tenure and to help alleviate the personal hardship resulting from the end of your employment with us, you are eligible to participate in an exit incentive program (hereafter called “program”), briefly described below, and described in more detail in the attached Severance Agreement and General Release (hereafter “Agreement”), provided you comply with the terms and conditions of the program.







As mentioned in a previous letter to you, to assist in your efforts to obtain suitable reemployment, we have arranged for individual, one-on-one outplacement counseling services through the firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc for a period of six months beginning on the date of termination referenced earlier in this letter.  We believe that this program is one of the best available and may assist you in significantly reducing the interim period between jobs and may assist your efforts in obtaining reemployment in a suitable position.  Although the decision is yours, we strongly urge you to participate in this valuable service.  Please contact Jason Bellard at (212) 907-6461 or jasonbellard@challengergray.com to initiate action on this serv
ice.  We will also provide Mr. Bellard with your contact information so that he may reach out to you.







You are eligible to participate in the program that will provide departing employees who agree to the terms and conditions of the program with a severance benefit.  Details of this program and its terms and conditions for receipt of the severance benefit are set forth in the attached document, titled Severance Agreement and General Release.  Because this is a formal legal document, we encourage you to read it carefully.  We also advise you to review it with an attorney.







While your decision to participate in the program is voluntary, in order to qualify for and receive it, you must return the attached Agreement, signed and dated where indicated.  In accordance with federal law, you have up to 45 days to consider the terms of this Agreement. Therefore, while you may sign and return it sooner, you must do so no later than November 6, 2010.  If you do not timely return the Agreement, the offer it contains will no longer be available to you.  You will also have a period of 7 days following the execution of the Agreement in which to change your mind and revoke, or take back, your acceptance of the Agreement.  If you do not revoke your acceptance of the Agreement within the 7 days, the release will then take effect, and you will receive the benefits described in the Agree
ment.  It should be returned to the attention of Eric W. Thornburg, President & CEO, marked "Personal and Confidential".







If you have any questions about the enclosed Agreement please feel free to contact Kristen Johnson, Vice President of Human Resources, for clarification.  In any event, before signing the Agreement, you are encouraged to consult an attorney for a full explanation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.







I appreciate your efforts during your service to The Connecticut Water Company, and I wish you well in your future endeavors.







Sincerely,












/s/  Kristen A. Johnson

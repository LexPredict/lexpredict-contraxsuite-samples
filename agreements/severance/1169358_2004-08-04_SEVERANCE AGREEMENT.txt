FORM OF CHANGE-OF-CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT




AGREEMENT, dated as of June 10, 2004, by and between Inveresk Research

(the “Participant”).



Section 1




PURPOSE




This Agreement is intended to provide severance benefits to the
Participant in the event that the Participant’s employment is terminated under
certain circumstances within 24 months following a Change of Control.



Section 2




DEFINITIONS




Except as otherwise may be specified or as the context otherwise may
require, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below
whenever used in this Agreement:



“Base Compensation” shall mean the annual base rate of cash compensation
of the Participant immediately before a Change of Control, or if greater, the
highest such annual rate at any time during the 12-month period immediately
preceding the Change of Control. The term “Base Compensation” shall include
the greater of (i) the cash bonus (if any) paid to the Participant for the year
most recently ended before the Change of Control or (ii) the target bonus
established for the Participant for the year in which a Covered Termination
occurs, and also shall include any other non-contingent cash compensation to
which the Participant may be entitled (such as car allowance, housing allowance
or pension contributions) but shall not include other contingent incentives or
performance awards.



“Board” shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.



“Cause” shall mean (i) the Participant’s conviction for (or pleading nolo
contendere to) any felony, or any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (ii)
the Participant’s commission of an act of fraud, theft or dishonesty related to
the performance of the Participant’s duties with the Company; (iii) the willful
and continuing failure or habitual neglect by the Participant to perform the
Participant’s duties hereunder after reasonable notice and affording the
Participant a reasonable opportunity to cease such failure or neglect; or (iv)
the Participant’s willful and continuing material breach of the terms of the
Participant’s employment with the Company after reasonable notice and affording
the Participant a reasonable opportunity to cure such breach.



“Change of Control” means the occurrence of any of the following:




(i) any “person,” including a “group” (as those terms are used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), becomes the beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing a majority of
either (A) the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding
securities or (B) the aggregate equity ownership of the Company; or




















(ii) any merger or consolidation of the Company with another
corporation or other entity (or any other form of business combination
having a similar effect) in which the outstanding shares of common stock
of the Company immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or other
business combination do not, immediately after the merger, consolidation
or other business combination, continue to represent or entitle the
holders thereof to receive, securities representing in the aggregate 50%
or more of the equity ownership and combined voting power of the
surviving corporation or other entity (or of its ultimate parent
corporation or other entity, if any); or




(iii) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one
transaction or a series of transactions contemplated or arranged by any
party as a single plan) of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company; or




(iv) a change in the composition of the Board upon which a majority
of the members of the Board are not persons who (A) were directors of the
Company for at least the preceding 24 consecutive months or (B) when they
initially were elected to the Board, (1) were nominated (if they were
elected by the stockholders) or appointed (if they were appointed by the
directors) by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors who
were Continuing Directors (as defined below) at the time of the
nomination or appointment by the Board and (2) were not elected as a
result of an actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by
a person other than the Board or an agreement intended to avoid or settle
such a proxy solicitation (the directors described in clause (A) and (B)
being “Continuing Directors”).



Following the occurrence of a Change of Control, no subsequent event or
condition shall constitute a Change of Control, with the result that there can
be no more than one Change of Control for purposes of this Agreement.



“Code” shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.



“Company” shall mean, Inveresk Research Group, Inc, a Delaware
corporation, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and subject to the
provisions of Section 5.1, also shall include any corporation or other entity
that acquires (including by way of merger, consolidation or other business
combination) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.



“Covered Termination” shall mean within the period of 24 months
immediately following a Change of Control the Participant (i) is terminated by
the Company without Cause (other than on account of death or Disability), or
(ii) terminates his or her employment with the Company for Good Reason. The
Participant’s employment shall not be deemed to have terminated for purposes of
this Agreement merely because he or she ceases to be employed by the Company
and becomes employed by a successor entity in connection with the Change of
Control, if the new employer expressly agrees to be bound by this Agreement as
a successor to the Company. Similarly, no Covered Termination shall be deemed
to have occurred if upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Participant
ceases to be employed by the Company and does not accept an offer of employment
made by the successor entity in connection with the Change of Control on terms
and conditions which, if imposed by the Company, would not give the Participant
a basis on which to terminate employment for Good Reason.



“Date of Termination” shall mean the date on which a Covered Termination
occurs.



“Disability” shall mean, after a Change of Control, the Participant’s
eligibility for disability benefits under the Company’s long-term disability
plans and arrangements (or, if none apply, would have been so eligible under
the most recent plan or arrangement).



2















“Good Reason” shall mean the occurrence without the express written
consent of the Participant of any of the following circumstances, unless such
circumstances are fully corrected prior to the Date of Termination specified in
the Notice of Termination given in respect thereof:




(i) a material reduction of the Participant’s authority, duties or
responsibilities, or the assignment to the Participant of duties
materially inconsistent with the Participant’s position or positions with
the Company; provided, that a reduction in authority, duties or
responsibilities solely by virtue of the Company being acquired and made
part of a larger business organization (as, for example, would occur if
the Participant retained the same position as a senior executive of the
business unit that was the Company before the Change of Control but did
not obtain a similar position with the Company’s new parent or holding
company) shall not constitute Good Reason and a change in the
Participant’s reporting relationships shall not constitute Good Reason;




(ii) a reduction in the Base Compensation of the Participant or a
material reduction in the other employment-related benefits of the
Participant;




(iii) the failure by the Company to obtain an agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Participant from any successor
to the business of the Company to assume and agree to perform the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement;




(iv) the relocation of the Participant’s place of work by the
Company to a location more than 50 miles from the Participant’s office
immediately prior to the Effective Date;




(v) a purported termination of the Participants; or




(vi) the Company’s material and willful breach of the terms of this
Agreement.



“Notice of Termination” shall mean a notice given by the Company or the
Participant, as applicable, indicating the specific termination provision in
this Agreement relied upon and setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Participant’s
employment under the provisions so indicated.



“Parachute Payment” shall mean any payment deemed to constitute a
“parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.



Section 3




BENEFITS




3.1 If a Covered Termination occurs with respect to the Participant, the
Company shall pay and provide, and the Participant shall be entitled to, the
following:



(a) payment (in a lump sum) of all salary, bonus and other cash benefits
accrued through the Date of Termination, and of all reimbursable business
expenses for which reimbursement requests have been duly submitted, which shall
be payable as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 10 days after
the Date of Termination;



(b) payment
(in a lump sum) of an amount equal to
times the
Participant’s Base Compensation, which shall be paid as promptly as practicable
but in no event later than 30 days after the Date of Termination;



(c) except for health benefits (which are addressed in Section 3.1(d)),
continuation of all other benefits programs and policies operated by the
Company, in accordance with, and to the extent permitted under, the terms of
those programs;



3















(d) for a period of 12 months after the Date of Termination the
continuation of health benefits (including any medical, vision or dental
benefits) that are at a level at least equivalent in the aggregate to the level
of such benefits which was available to the Participant and the Participant’s
family members immediately prior to the Change of Control, at no greater cost
to the Participant; and



(e) all rights of the Participant in outstanding stock options, shares of
restricted stock and other equity-based compensation arrangements (if any), to
the extent not then fully vested, shall vest as of the date of the Covered
Termination.



3.2 No payment need be made pursuant to Section 3.1(b) unless and until
the Company shall have first received from the Participant a valid, binding and
irrevocable general release, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company and, to the extent the validity of the release under applicable law is
conditioned on the passage of time or other requirements, until those
requirements have been satisfied.



Section 4




PARACHUTE TAX PROVISIONS




If any amount payable to or other benefit receivable by the Participant
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is deemed to constitute a Parachute
Payment, alone or when added to any other amount payable or paid to or other
benefit receivable or received by the Participant which is deemed to constitute
a Parachute Payment (whether or not under an existing plan, arrangement or
other agreement), and would result in the imposition on the Participant of an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the amount payable hereunder shall
be reduced by the smallest amount required to avoid the imposition of such
excise tax. The amount of any adjustment under this Section 4 shall be
computed by a certified public accountant selected and paid by the Company.



Section 5




SUCCESSORS; TERM




5.1 The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect,
by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of
the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume and agree to perform
the Company’s obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Company and its affiliates would be required to perform it
if no such succession had taken place (provided, that such a requirement to
perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements for such an express assumption and agreement). Failure of the
Company to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to the Participant
prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a material breach of
this Agreement and shall entitle the Participant to compensation from the
Company (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the
same terms as the Participant would be entitled to hereunder were the
Participant’s employment terminated for Good Reason following a Change of
Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on
which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of
Termination. Nothing in this Section 5.1 shall be deemed to cause any event or
condition that otherwise would constitute a Change of Control not to constitute
a Change of Control.



5.2 Notwithstanding Section 5.1, the Company shall remain liable to the
Participant to the extent a Covered Termination occurs upon a Change of Control
because (i) the Participant is not offered continuing employment by a successor
to the Company or (ii) the Participant declines such an offer and the
Participant’s resulting termination of employment otherwise constitutes a
Covered Termination hereunder.



4















5.3 This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties shall
terminate on, and be of no further force or effect after, the second
anniversary of the date hereof unless on or prior to that date a Change of
Control shall have occurred (in which event this Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the parties shall remain in effect in accordance with its
terms).



Section 6




MISCELLANEOUS




6.1 The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of the
Participant. If the Participant shall die while an amount still would be
payable to the Participant hereunder if the Participant had continued to live,
all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement to the Participant’s devisee, legatee or other
designee or estate.



6.2 The Participant shall not be required to mitigate damages or the
amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement by seeking other
employment or otherwise, nor will any payments or benefits hereunder be subject
to offset in the event the Participant does mitigate.



6.3 The Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses incurred in any
legal proceeding by the Participant in seeking to obtain or enforce any right
or benefit provided by this Agreement. Such payments shall be made within five
days after the Participant’s request for payment accompanied with such evidence
of fees and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require; provided
that if the Participant institutes a proceeding and the judge or other
decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that the
Participant instituted the proceeding in bad faith, the Participant shall pay
the Participant’s own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any
amounts theretofore paid under this Section 6.3).



6.4 The Participant may file a claim for benefits under this Agreement by
written communication to the Board. A notice addressed to the Board and
delivered to the Company’s principal executive officers will satisfy this
requirement.



6.5 This Agreement is the exclusive agreement between the parties
applicable to payments and benefits in connection with a Change of Control and
supersedes any prior arrangements involving the Company or its predecessors or
affiliates relating to changes of control. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no other severance payments shall be payable by the Company to
the Participant in the event of a Change of Control if any payment is due under
Section 3.1(b); provided, that nothing in this Agreement shall limit any right
of the Participant to receive any payments or benefits under an employee
benefit or executive compensation plan of the Company, which are expressly
contingent upon the occurrence of a change of control (including, but not
limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); however, in
no event shall the Participant be entitled to any payment or benefit under this
Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by the
Participant under any severance or similar plan or policy of the Company.



6.6 Nothing in this Agreement shall confer on the Participant any right to
continue in the employ of the Company or interfere in any way (other than by
virtue of requiring payments or benefits as may expressly be provided herein)
with the right of the Company to terminate the Participant’s employment at any
time.



6.7 The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed
payments any amount of tax withholding required by law.



5















6.8 The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.



6.9 The use of captions in this Agreement is for convenience and shall not
affect the interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement. The captions
are not intended to and do not provide substantive rights.



6.10 THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED, ADMINISTERED AND ENFORCED
ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAW, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed and delivered this
Agreement as of the date first set forth above.

information for his own benefit or the benefit of any party other than the
Company. This Section 4 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

5. Executive's  Covenants.  The Executive agrees that,  subject to the terms and
conditions  of this  Agreement,  in the event of a  Potential  Change in Control

months from the date of such  Potential  Change in  Control,  (ii) the date of a
Change  in  Control,  (iii)  the date of  termination  by the  Executive  of his
employment for Good Reason (determined by treating a Potential Change in Control
as a Change in Control in applying the  definition  of Good Reason) or by reason
of death, Retirement or Total Disability, or (iv) the termination by the Company
of the Executive's employment for any reason.

6.  Compensation  Upon  Termination  Following a Change in Control.  If,  within
thirty (30) months after the occurrence of a Change in Control,  the Executive's
employment is terminated other than (i) by the Company for Cause, (ii) by reason
of death,  Total  Disability,  or Retirement,  or (iii) by the Executive without
Good  Reason,  then,  in  addition  to all  obligations  otherwise  owing to the
Executive  on the  Effective  Date,  the  Company  shall pay or  provide  to the
Executive within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date the following: (I) a lump
sum amount equal to the product of 2.5 and the sum of (a) the  Executive's  then
Regular Annual Salary, and (b) the annual amount that would be paid to Executive
pursuant to the Company's  Performance  Bonus Plan assuming that all performance
levels had been achieved

<page>

at  maximum  levels;  (II) for a period  of thirty  (30)  months  following  the
Effective Date, (A) the continuation of health  insurance,  life insurance,  and
disability  insurance  benefits  substantially  the  same as any  such  benefits
provided to Executive  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Date by the Company
under group insurance plans or otherwise,  to the extent  permissible  under the
terms of such  plans to do so and if such  coverage  is not  permitted,  amounts
necessary  for premium  payments  for such  coverage;  (B) the  continuation  of
Executive's  car  allowance,  and club  membership  fees,  if any (or an  amount
sufficient to cover such continued car allowance and club membership  fees); and
(III) the Tax Gross-Up Amount,  if applicable.  Except as specifically  provided
herein,  no other  payments  or  benefits  will be  furnished  or paid,  and all
contributions  or deductions,  if any (other than  deductions made in connection
with the benefits  specifically  provided for herein, if any), shall cease as of
the Effective Date.

The Executive's employment shall be deemed to have been terminated within thirty
(30) months after the  occurrence of a Change in Control by the Company  without
Cause or by the Executive  with Good Reason and the Executive  shall be entitled
to receive the payments described in this Section 6 (i) if terminated prior to a
Change in Control  without  Cause at the  direction of a person or entity who or
that has entered into an agreement  with the Company the  consummation  of which
will  constitute  a Change in Control or (ii) if the  Executive  terminates  his
employment with Good Reason prior to a Change in Control (determined by treating
a Potential  Change in Control as a Change in Control in applying the definition
of Good Reason) if the circumstance or event that constitutes Good Reason occurs
at the direction of such person or entity.

7. Not an Employment Agreement;  Superceding Effect. This Agreement shall not be
construed  as  creating  an express  or implied  contract  of  employment.  This
Agreement shall  supercede any severance  agreement  previously  entered into or
obligation  otherwise  agreed to between  the  parties  hereto  with  respect to
severance payments.

8. Successors; Binding Agreement.

(a) In addition to any obligations imposed by law upon any successor to the
Company, the Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect,  by
purchase,  merger,  consolidation,  or otherwise) to all or substantially all of
the business or assets (or a  combination  thereof) of the Company  expressly to
assume and agree to perform  this  Agreement  in the same manner and to the same
extent  that the Company  would be required to perform it if no such  succession
had taken place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement
prior to the  effectiveness  of any such  succession  shall be a breach  of this
Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to the payments described in Section 6
that  would be  payable  upon  termination  by the  Executive  for  Good  Reason
immediately after a Change in Control.

(b) This Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Executive's  legal  representatives  and other successors in interest,  provided
that this  Agreement may not be assigned by Executive.  If Executive  dies while
any amount  (other  than an amount  that by its terms is to  terminate  upon his
death) would still be payable to him hereunder if he was still

<page>

living,  all such amounts shall be paid in accordance with this Agreement to the
executors,  personal  representatives,  or  administrators  of  the  Executive's
estate.

9. Fees. The Company shall pay to Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred
by Executive as a result of Executive's termination (including all such fees and
expenses, if any, incurred in contesting or disputing any such termination or in
seeking  to or in  connection  with any tax audit or  proceeding  to the  extent
attributable  to the  application of Section 4999 of the Code, to any payment or
benefit  provided  hereunder)  unless such termination is (i) by the Company for
Cause; (ii) by reason of death, Total Disability or Retirement,  or (iii) by the
Executive without Good Reason.

10.  Miscellaneous.  No provision of this Agreement may be modified,  waived, or
discharged unless so agreed by the parties in writing. No waiver shall be deemed
a waiver of the same or any other  provision at the same or any other time. This
Agreement sets forth the entire  agreement of the parties  regarding its subject
matter.  This  Agreement  shall be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri
other than the conflicts of law provisions  thereof.  All payments  provided for
hereunder  shall  be made  net of any  applicable  withholding  requirements  of
federal,  state,  or  local  law.  The  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of any
provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of
any other provision of this Agreement.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed or caused to be executed this
Agreement as of the date set forth above.

and the Company, which cannot be fully redressed by payment of damages. Accordingly, Purchaser shall be entitled in addition to any other right or remedy it may have, at law or in equity, to an injunction, enjoining or restraining Seller from any violation or threatened violation of this section.

Business (except on behalf of the Seller); (d) solicit, contact, call upon, communicate with or attempt to communicate, with any referral source of the Seller, or any representative of any referral source of the Seller, with a view to obtaining referrals for any service the same or essentially the same as Seller Competing Business (except on behalf of the Seller); or (e) render advice or assistance, or have any interest in, or provide any services to any Seller Competing Business; provided, however, that ownership of no more than one percent (1%) of the stock of a publicly traded corporation engaged in a competitive business shall not be deemed to be engaging in a Seller Competing Business. Purchaser acknowledges that violation of such covenant not to compete would cause irreparable harm to Seller, which cannot be fully redressed by payment of damages. Accordingly, Seller shall be entitled in addition to any other right or remedy it may have, at law or in equity, to an injunction, enjoining or restrain
ing Purchaser from any violation or threatened violation of this section. If any of the rights or restrictions contained herein shall be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of the extent, duration or geographical scope thereof or any other provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto contemplate that the court shall reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope or other provision and enforce this section in its reduced form for all purposes in the manner contemplated hereby.

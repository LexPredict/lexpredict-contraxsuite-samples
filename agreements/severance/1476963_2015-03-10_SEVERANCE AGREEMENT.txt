The Arbitrator shall render an award that conforms to the facts, as supported by competent evidence (except that the Arbitrator may accept written declarations under penalty of perjury, in addition to live testimony), and the law as it would be applied by a court sitting in the State of North Carolina. The cost of arbitration shall be advanced equally by the parties. Any party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for entry of judgment on the arbitration award.



c.

PRIOR AGREEMENTS SUPERSEDED.  This Agreement supersedes all previous Agreements between the Executive and Heat, including the Employment Agreement.  To the extent that there is any conflict between this Agreement and any earlier agreement between Heat and Executive, this Agreement governs.

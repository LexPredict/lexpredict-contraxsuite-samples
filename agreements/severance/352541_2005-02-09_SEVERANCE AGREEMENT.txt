or contingent,                arising out of or in any way connected with Employee’s
employment with                Employer or the termination thereof. This Agreement

6. 	Indemnification;
Cooperation. In the event that Employee is, or may                become, personally
liable as a result of any litigation or claim arising out of                or associated
with or related to Employee’s employment with Employer,                Employer
shall, to the fullest extent permitted or required by Sections 180.0850                to
180.0859, inclusive, of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, including any
amendments thereto, by the Employer’s Articles of Incorporation and
by any                insurance policies purchased by Employer, indemnify Employee
against any and all                liabilities, and advance any and all reasonable
expenses, incurred by Employee                with regard to such proceeding. Employee
agrees that he shall also fully                cooperate with Employer in any
investigation Employer may conduct or which may                be conducted by a
government agency or entity or in any litigation in which                Employee or
Company may become involved. Suchcooperation shall include                Employee’s
making himself reasonably available for interviews by Employer                or its
counsel, depositions and/or court appearances upon Employer’s
request. Employer shall attempt to schedule such cooperation at mutually
convenient times and places. Employer shall reimburse Employee for
reasonable                expenses, such astelephone, travel, lodging and meal
expenses, incurred                by Employee at Employer’s request consistent with
Employer’s generally                applicable policies for employee expenses.






7. 	Restrictions.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,                it is
expressly agreed that all payments under this Agreement shall terminate,
and that Employer shall have no further obligation under this Agreement,
upon                any violation of the provisions of this Paragraph 7. Payments
pursuant to                this Agreement are intended to serve as consideration
for these                restrictions. If Employee received payments pursuant to
Paragraph 2 and                violates Paragraph 7, Employee shall repay to Employer the
portion of the                benefits previously received.

a. 	Covenant
Not To Compete. The restrictions of this paragraph apply from                the
Severance Date until the second anniversary of the Severance Date and within
the states of Wisconsin and Iowa. The Employee shall not accept employment
with,                or become a consultant to, any business in any capacity in which his
job duties                would entail assisting that business to compete with the
Employer’s                businesses in the above-described geographic area, unless
approval is obtained                in advance from the Employer’s President. If the
Employee advises                Employer’s President in writing of a position with a
business that he would                like to accept, Employer’s President shall
respond in writing within a                reasonable period not to exceed ten (10)
business days from the date of receipt                of the request. Employee shall not
become a partner or a shareholder in any                business that is in competition
with Employer’s businesses in the                above-described geographic area,
although Employee may hold up to a five percent                interest in any company
without violating the provisions of this Paragraph 7.a.                The restrictions
of this Paragraph 7.a shall terminate immediately upon 1) any                liquidation
or dissolution of Employer or 2) any sale of stock, sale of                substantially
all of the assets, merger, reorganization or other transactions                that
result in 50% or more of the ownership or control of Employer being in the
hands of persons or entities other than the shareholders of the Employer.

b. 	Confidentiality.
Employee agrees to hold in strictest of confidence, and                not use to compete
with Employer or disclose to anyone except as expressly                authorized in
writing by Employer, any proprietary or confidential information                of
Employer or other information and data pertaining to the activities and
operations of Employer and not made available to the general public by
Employer                or with Employer’s consent. Proprietary and confidential
information                includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets, information
relating to the                business, financial, legal and personnel matters of
Employer, information                relating to the internal operations of Employer such
as operations methods,                equipment, and quality control procedures,
information relating to development                projects, information relating to
actual or potential customers or suppliers,                marketing plans, price and
cost data, and proprietary information of other                companies or individuals
which has been disclosed to Employer under a                requirement of secrecy.
Proprietary and confidential information may or may not                be in documentary
form and includes computer software programs, drawings, plans,                letters and
databases. This obligation shall remain in effect for so long as                Employee
has knowledge or possession of information that remains confidential                and
secret. Employee shall promptly return to Employer, and not deliver to
anyone else, all documents and materials containing proprietary and
confidential                information, including the original and all copies and
summaries of such                documents and materials. In the event Employee breaches
the terms of this                Paragraph 7.b, Employee shall be responsible for
whatever damages Employer                incurs as a result of said breach, including
reasonable costs and                attorney’s fees of an action to enforce the
Agreement. In addition to all                of the remedies otherwise available to
Employer, Employer shall have the right                to injunctive relief to restrain
and enjoin any actual or threatened breach of                this Paragraph 7.b.

c. 	Non-Disparagement. Employee
agrees that he will not criticize, denigrate                or disparage Employer in any
public forum or in the media or to any third                parties. For purposes of this
paragraph “disparage” shall mean any                statements, actions or
insinuations, made either directly or through a third                party, that would
tend to lessen the standing or stature of Employer in the eyes                of an
ordinary person.







The
Employee agrees that the restrictions set forth in this Paragraph 7, including but not
limited to, the time period and the geographical area of such restrictions are fair and
reasonable and are reasonably required for the protection of the interests of the Company
and its affiliated companies. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any of
the provisions of this Paragraph 7 shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions thereof shall nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as
though the invalid or unenforceable parts had not been included. In the event that any
provision of this Paragraph 7 relating to the time period and/or the areas of restriction
shall be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the maximum time period
or areas such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the time period and/or areas of
restriction deemed reasonable and enforceable by said court shall become and thereafter
be the maximum time period and/or areas.

with Employer, its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates for the purpose of
applying for or seeking reemployment or reinstatement of employment in any
position, capacity or context.

implied. This Agreement shall be amended only by a written agreement signed by

53707-1007 within seven calendar days after Employee signs           the Agreement. This
Agreement shall not become effective or enforceable if           revoked. Any revocation,

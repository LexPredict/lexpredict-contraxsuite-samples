4.2           Change in Control Termination Benefits (Double Trigger).  If both: (A) a Change in Control occurs and (B) on, or within two years after the Change in Control, Company Involuntarily Terminates Executive’s employment or Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason (“Change in Control Termination”), then, subject to Section 6.1, Company will provide Executive with the following benefits (collectively referred to as the “Change in Control Termination Benefits”):

(ii) Executive’s unearned bonus under Company’s annual cash incentive plan payable for the fiscal year in which Executive’s date of termination occurs, with such bonus amount determined at the end of the performance period in accordance with the plan, and then such earned amount (if any) (x) prorated to Executive’s date of termination and (y) paid to Executive in a lump sum on the normal payment date for such annual bonuses under the plan, but not later than the March 15th following the end of the performance period;

(vi) all account balances in any supplemental and/or non-qualified retirement plans shall become fully vested; and







(vii) the Welfare Plan Costs.







Subject to Section 6.1, the lump sum cash payment(s) payable to Executive pursuant to Sections 4.2(i) and 4.2(vii) shall be paid within 70 days after Executive’s termination of employment with Company.

6.3           Liquidated Damages.  In light of the difficulties in estimating the damages for an early termination of Executive’s employment under this Agreement, Company and Executive hereby agree that the payments, if any, to be received by Executive pursuant to this Article 6 shall be received by Executive as liquidated damages.







6.4           Affect on Other Benefits.  This Agreement governs the rights and obligations of Executive and Company with respect to Executive’s termination of employment during the Term.  Except as expressly provided herein, Executive’s rights and obligations both during the Term and thereafter with respect to stock options, SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, incentive and deferred compensation, and other compensation and benefits under the plans and programs maintained by Company shall be governed by the separate agreements, plans and other documents and instruments governing such matters; provided, however, any severance payments or benefits received under this Agreement shall offset any payments or severance benefits otherwise payable to Executive under a severance plan or program of Company for its employees in general.







6.5           Malfeasance (Clawback).  If Company determines at any time within two years after Executive’s termination that Executive’s employment could have been terminated for Cause, Company retains the rights to recover any severance benefits provided hereunder to Executive (cash or other).  In such case, Executive agrees to promptly repay such amounts to Company.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, Company shall seek recovery of any benefits provided hereunder to Executive (cash or other) if Company is required by applicable law, including, but not limited to, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any regulations promulgated thereunder, to seek recovery of the benefits provided under this Agreement.







6.6           409A Delay in Payments.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if on the date of his separation from service Executive is a “specified employee,” as defined in Section 409A of the Code, then all or a portion of any severance payments or benefits under this Agreement that would be subject to the additional tax provided by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code if not delayed as required by Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code shall be delayed until the first day of the seventh month following his separation from service (or, if earlier, Executive’s date of death) and shall be paid as a lump sum (without interest) on such date.

Executive further acknowledges that protection of such confidential business information and trade secrets against unauthorized disclosure and use is of critical importance to Company and its affiliates in maintaining their competitive position.  Executive hereby agrees that Executive will not, at any time during or after Executive’s employment by Company, make any unauthorized disclosure of any confidential business information or trade secrets of Company and its affiliates, or make any use thereof, except in the carrying out of Executive’s employment responsibilities hereunder.  Company and its affiliates shall be third party beneficiaries of Executive’s obligations under this Section.  As a result of Executive’s employment by Company, Executive may also from time to time have access to, or knowledge of, confidential business information or trade secrets of third parties, such as customers, suppliers, partners, joint venturers, and the like, of Company and its affiliates.  Executive also agrees to preserve and protect the confidentiality of such third party confidential information and trade secrets to the same extent, and on the same basis, as the confidential business information and trade secrets of Company and its affiliates.  These obligations of confidence apply irrespective of whether the information has been reduced to a tangible medium of expression (e.g., is only maintained in the minds of Company’s employees) and, if it has been reduced to a tangible medium, irrespective of the form or medium in which the information is embodied (e.g., documents, drawings, memoranda, notes, records, files, correspondence, manuals, models, specifications, computer programs, E-mail, voice mail, electronic databases, maps and all other writings or materials of any type).







7.5           Assistance by Executive.  Both during the period of Executive’s employment by Company and thereafter, Executive shall assist Company and its affiliates and their respective nominees, at any time, in the protection of Company’s and its affiliates’ worldwide rights, titles, and interests in and to information, ideas, concepts, improvements, discoveries, and inventions, and their copyrighted works, including without limitation, the execution of all formal assignment documents requested by Company and its affiliates or their respective nominees and the execution of all lawful oaths and applications for applications for patents and registration of copyright in the United States and foreign countries.







7.6           Remedies.  Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Article 7 by Executive, and Company shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this Article 7 by terminating any payments then owing to Executive under this Agreement and/or to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach.  Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Article 7, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to Company and its affiliates, including the recovery of damages from Executive and Executive’s agents involved in such breach and remedies available to Company and its affiliates pursuant to other agreements with Executive.












ARTICLE 8:                                NON-COMPETITION OBLIGATIONS (Applies Prior to a Change in Control)







8.1           Non-competition Obligations.  As part of the consideration for the compensation and benefits to be paid to Executive hereunder, to protect the trade secrets and confidential information of Company and its affiliates that will be disclosed or entrusted to Executive, the business good will of Company and its affiliates that will in the future be developed in Executive, or the business opportunities that will in the future be disclosed or entrusted to Executive by Company and its affiliates, Company and Executive agree to the provisions of this Article 8. Executive agrees that during the period of Executive’s non-competition obligations hereunder, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly for Executive or for others, in any geographic area or market where Company or its affiliates are conducting any business as of the date of termination of the employment relationship or have during the previous 12 months conducted any business:







(i)           engage in any engineering, construction, or services business supporting the energy, petrochemicals, government services or civil infrastructure sectors that is competitive with the business conducted by Company or its affiliates;







(ii)           render any advice or services to, or otherwise assist, any other person, association, or entity who is engaged, directly or indirectly, with any engineering, construction, or services business supporting the energy, petrochemicals, government services or civil infrastructure sectors that is competitive with the business conducted by Company or its affiliates;







(iii)           induce any employee of Company or its affiliates to terminate his or her employment with Company or its affiliates, or hire or assist in the hiring of any such employee by any person, association, or entity not affiliated with Company; or







(iv)           request or cause any customer of Company or its affiliates to terminate any business relationship with Company or its affiliates.







These non-competition obligations shall apply during the period that Executive is employed by Company and its affiliates and shall continue until the first anniversary of his termination of employment; provided, however, with respect to termination of employment on or after a Change in Control, the obligations under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) shall cease to apply.  Executive understands that the foregoing restrictions may limit Executive’s ability to engage in certain businesses anywhere in the world during the period provided for above, but acknowledges that Executive will receive sufficiently high remuneration and other benefits under this Agreement to justify such restriction.







8.2           Enforcement and Remedies.  Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of this Article 8 by Executive, and Company shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of this Article 8 by terminating any payments then owing to Executive under this Agreement and/or to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach.  Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Article 8, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to Company, including, without limitation, the recovery of damages from Executive and Executive’s agents involved in such breach and remedies available to Company pursuant to other agreements with Executive.







8.3           Reformation.  It is expressly understood and agreed that Company and Executive consider the restrictions contained in this Article 8 to be reasonable and necessary to protect the proprietary information of Company and its affiliates.  Nevertheless, if any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by a court (or arbitrator) having jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth to be modified by such court (or arbitrator) so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified by the court (or arbitrator), to be fully enforced.

9.3           No Waiver.  No failure by either party hereto at any time to give notice of any breach by the other party of, or to require compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.







9.4           Severability.  If a court (or an arbitrator) of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of that provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.







9.5           Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same Agreement.







9.6           Withholding of Taxes and Other Employee Deductions.  Company may withhold from any benefits and payments made pursuant to this Agreement all federal, state, city and other taxes as may be required pursuant to any law or governmental regulation or ruling and all other normal employee deductions made with respect to Company’s employees generally.







9.7           Headings.  The Section headings have been inserted for purposes of convenience and shall not be used for interpretive purposes.







9.8           Gender and Plurals.  Wherever the context so requires, the masculine gender includes the feminine or neuter, and the singular number includes the plural and conversely.







9.9           Affiliate.  As used in this Agreement, the term “affiliate” shall mean any entity which owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with, Company.







9.10           Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Company and any successor of Company, by merger or otherwise.  Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, are personal and neither this Agreement, nor any right, benefit, or obligation of either party hereto, shall be subject to voluntary or involuntary assignment, alienation or transfer, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party.







9.11           Entire Agreement.  Except as provided in any signed written agreement contemporaneously or hereafter executed by Company and Executive, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and contains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties and agreements between the parties with respect to employment of Executive by Company.  Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, all individual employment, severance, and change in control agreements between the parties preceding the date of execution of this Agreement and relating to the subject matter hereof are hereby null and void and of no further force and effect.  Any modification of this Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and signed by the party to be charged.







9.12           KBR Dispute Resolution Plan.  It is the mutual intention of the parties to have any dispute concerning this Agreement resolved out of court.  Accordingly, the parties agree that any such dispute shall, as the sole and exclusive remedy, be submitted for resolution through the KBR Dispute Resolution Plan; provided, however, that Executive, on his own behalf and on behalf of any Company entities, shall be entitled to seek a restraining order or injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any breach or the continuation of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement, and Executive hereby consents that such restraining order or injunction may be granted without the necessity of Company posting any bond.  The parties agree that the resolution of any such dispute through the KBR Dispute Resolution Plan shall be final and binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on or after a Change in Control, the parties will no longer be subject to the KBR Dispute Resolution Plan and may seek resolution in court, subject to Section 9.2.







9.13.           Tax Cooperation.  Except for any excess parachute payments, it is the intent of Company and Executive that compensation paid to Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, be deductible by Company for federal tax purposes.  In this regard, the parties intend that bonuses and other performance-based pay of Executive will comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.  Accordingly, if the definition of Target Bonus Opportunity would cause a bonus granted to Executive under Company’s annual incentive compensation plan to not meet the requirements of Section 162(m), such definition shall be modified or deleted, as necessary, as determined in good faith by the Committee, to comply with Section 162(m).  Executive agrees to take all actions reasonably requested by Company with respect to Company being able to deduct Executive’s compensation for federal tax purposes.  In addition, Company and Executive agree to cooperate so that, to the extent reasonably practical, no payments to Executive will be subject to the additional tax provided by Section 409A.







9.14           Employment.  As of the Effective Date, Executive is an employee of Employer and an officer of Company and the parties acknowledge that such dual status may continue.  The parties agree that the term “Company” may mean “Employer” or “affiliate” in this Agreement, as the context and facts require, all as determined in good faith by the Committee, or its delegate.  For purposes of this Agreement, a “termination of Executive’s employment” means a separation of service for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  A transfer to an affiliate shall not be a termination of Executive’s employment.






































IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement effective for all purposes as of the Effective Date.

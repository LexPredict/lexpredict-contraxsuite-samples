on April 15, 1998, ASCI and Employee entered into an Employment and Noncompetition
Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (“Employment
Agreement”), which, among other things, provides the terms and conditions of

will resign from his employment with Advance effective as of August 15, 2003;



WHEREAS,
Advance has agreed to provide to Employee the benefits and payments provided for in this
Agreement, which are in addition to the benefits and payments which Advance is obligated
to provide to Employee in connection with the termination of Employee’s employment
with Advance under the terms of the Employment Agreement (which additional benefits and
payments include, but are not limited to, salary continuation for twelve (12) months
without reduction for other salary paid, bonus eligibility continuation for the remainder

terms and conditions of all other agreements between Advance and Employee (as modified
herein) which survive the termination of Employee’s employment with Advance.



NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual promises of the parties
set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the









receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:




1.
Recitals. The parties hereto agree that the foregoing recitals in this
Agreement are true and accurate.






2.
Discharge of Severance Obligations. Section 4 of the Employment Agreement
(Section 4 of Exhibit A) is hereby rescinded in full. In full discharge of all
of its obligations to Employee under the Employment Agreement, Advance shall pay
to Employee and Employee accepts from Advance the following:






2.01.
A lump sum payment, less all applicable withholding taxes and payroll
deductions, which shall be paid to Employee within two weeks after the Effective
Date, and which shall represent payment for the amount of his hours of accrued
but unused vacation time to which Employee would have been entitled as of the
date hereof had he not terminated his employment with Advance.






2.02.
(a)   The lump sum bonus payment of $36,933.24, less applicable withholding taxes
and payroll deductions, which shall be paid to Employee on the same date as
Advance pays bonuses under the comparable plans applicable to other executives
for the second fiscal quarter.







(b)   Lump sum bonus payments attributable to the third and fourth fiscal quarters of
those amounts which Employee would have been entitled to (if any) had Employee
remained an Employee through the time required to receive such bonus payments.
Such bonus payments shall be made at the time third and fourth quarter bonus
payments are made to other executives and shall include any annual roll-up
amounts that would have been earned.







(c)   When items 2.02(a) and 2.02(b) above are paid to Employee, such payment shall
constitute payment in full of Advance’s obligations under the 2003 Bonus
Plan for Employee, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (“2003
Bonus Plan”), as provided in Section 4.3(a)(ii) of the Employment
Agreement. Employee shall be entitled to no further bonus payments.






2.03.
The sum of $285,750, Employee’s applicable annual salary as of the date of
his termination of his employment with Advance, as provided in Section 4.3(a)(i)
of the Employment Agreement, which






2











shall be paid in equal installments (on the
normal management pay cycle) during the twelve (12) month period commencing on
August 16, 2003, less all applicable withholding taxes and payroll deductions.







2.04.
All payments to Employee under the provisions of Section Two (2) of this
Agreement (Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, and 2.04) will not be eligible for
deferral or matching contributions under any pension or benefit plan.






2.05.
Outplacement services for 12 months shall be provided to Employee under the
Executive Program by Lee Hecht Harrison to include consulting, search support
and administrative services.






3.
Medical Insurance Coverage. Advance will provide continued group health
insurance coverage pursuant to federal law under the regulations governing COBRA
continuation coverage, and under the terms of the applicable group health
plan(s) or successor plan(s). The date of the qualifying event is August 15,
2003, for COBRA continuation coverage purposes. From the starting date of the
period of COBRA continuation coverage for Employee and his dependants, until the
earlier of (a) 12 months, or (b) the date the Employee is covered under another
health insurance program, Advance will pay the normal employer contribution
towards such coverage (as though Employee were still an active employee) and
Employee (and/or his dependants) will be responsible for paying the normal
employee contribution towards such coverage. For the duration of Employee’s
payments pursuant to Section 2.03 of this Agreement, Advance may permit Employee
to have his required contribution for COBRA continuation coverage deducted from
said payments.






4.
Employee Employment Agreements and Resignation. Employee agrees to comply
fully, faithfully, and unconditionally with the terms of the Employment
Agreement which survive the termination of Employee’s employment with
Advance, including but not limited to Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, and 16 thereof, and with the terms of all other contracts and agreements
with Advance (as modified by this Agreement) which survive his termination.
Employee agrees that Advance’s obligations under this Agreement are
expressly conditioned upon Employee’s compliance with the terms of this
provision, and with the terms of all other agreements, covenants and obligations
of Employee under this Agreement and any other contracts and agreements with
Advance which service this Agreement. By signing this Agreement







3










Employee will be deemed to have submitted his voluntary resignation from employment with Advance
effective as of August 15, 2003.







5.
Release and Waiver. Employee for himself, his heirs, executors,
administrators and assigns, hereby knowingly, voluntarily and unconditionally
releases, waives, and forever discharges Advance and Advance’s subsidiaries
(including but not limited to Western Auto Supply Company), parents, affiliates,
and their joint and several employees, officers, directors, shareholders,
investors, benefit plans, trustees, and their successors and assigns
(hereinafter jointly and severally referred to for purposes of this Agreement as
“Releasees”), from any and all obligations, claims, demands,
liabilities, judgments, causes of action, suits at law or in equity, in tort,
contract, by statute or on any other basis, for pay and/or benefits, for
compensatory, punitive or other damages, attorney fees, expenses,
reimbursements, or costs of any kind, including, but not limited to, any and all
claims, demands, rights and/or causes of action under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Fair Labor
Standards Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, the Workers Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act, the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act or any other federal, state, or local statute or
ordinance or any other claims, whether statutory or based on common law,
arising: (a) by reason of his employment with Advance or the cessation of that
employment or circumstances related thereto; or (b) by reason of any other
matter, cause, or thing done, omitted or suffered to be done prior to and
including the date on which Employee signs below. The parties agree and
understand that this is not to be construed as an admission of liability by the
Releasees or any other person or entity released hereby, by whom any liability
is expressly denied. The Releasees expressly deny violation of any of their
policies, procedures or agreements, or of any federal, state or local laws or
regulations. Employee further acknowledges that he may subsequently discover
facts which were in existence at the time this Agreement and general release is
signed in addition to or different from those which he now knows or believes to
exist with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and which, if known
or suspected at the time of executing this Agreement, may have materially
affected this Agreement and settlement. Nevertheless, Employee hereby waives any
right, claim or cause of action that might arise as a result of such different
or additional facts provided such facts were in existence at the time this
Agreement and general release is signed.

6.
Derogatory or Defamatory Statements. Employee agrees that he will not, by
any means or in any media, make or provide any comment, information,
communication, expression, statement or depiction detrimental, injurious or
derogatory to the interests of Advance (including its directors, officers,
employees, investors, shareholders, affiliates or related entities)
(collectively referred to in this Section as the “Company”), and
further agrees that he will not disparage, denigrate, or cast the Company in an
unfavorable light in any manner. Employee also agrees that he will not encourage
or facilitate any other person to make any derogatory or disparaging comments on
his behalf, or attributable to him, or based in any way upon information he
supplied, about the Company or consent to or approve any such action by another
person. Specifically, Employee recognizes that by virtue of his position with
Advance or his knowledge of the Company or other information he possesses
(including, but not limited to Confidential Information as defined in the
Employment Agreement), he may be subjected to inquiries or otherwise approached
by the media (general or trade), potential or actual investors, business persons
(including, but not limited to, industry competitors) or other persons, and
asked for his opinions or comments regarding matters relating to the Company,
which may include, but is not limited to, information regarding the business
plans, strategies, personnel, officers, directors, and/or present or former
employees of the Company, and potential or actual investors. While this
Agreement is not intended to unduly restrict Employee’s ability to respond
to any such inquiries, both the Company and Employee desire to avoid any issues
or situations in which Employee’s opinions, comments or statements could be
misunderstood or mischaracterized to the detriment of the Company, or would
violate in any way this Section of the Agreement. If Employee has any questions
in the future regarding the scope or intent of this Section 6 and its
applicability to a particular circumstance, Employee agrees to contact the
President; the Senior Vice President, Human Resources; or the General Counsel of
ASCI and discuss the matter with the Advance officer so contacted before
responding to any inquiry or approach. Nothing herein shall prevent Employee
from correcting any false, misleading or deceptive statements made about
Employee.






7.
Cooperation. Employee acknowledges that by virtue of his position with
Advance, he has knowledge of a substantial number of business matters involving
Advance. During the period of time that Employee is being paid, as described in
Section 2 herein, Employee agrees to assist in the transition as well as provide
consulting services as needed by the Company. Employee agrees to cooperate fully
with Advance and/or its representatives and agents as to any matters upon which
Employee has






5










knowledge or on which he had any involvement prior to the
termination of his employment. Without limiting the scope of the above sentence,
Employee agrees to make himself reasonably available to assist Advance and its
representatives and agents with any business and/or litigation (or potential
litigation) matters affecting or involving Advance. Employee will be reimbursed
for all reasonable costs of travel.







8.
Reasonableness of Terms and Covenants. Employee acknowledges that Advance
would not have agreed to enter into this Agreement with Employee unless he
agreed to comply with the terms contained herein including, but not limited to,
numbered Sections 5 through 7 above. Accordingly, Employee further agrees that
the terms and covenants set forth in numbered Sections 5 through 7 above are
reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business and other interests
of Advance. Moreover, Employee agrees that the terms set forth in Section 7 of
the Employment Agreement also apply to any breach or threatened breach of any of
the matters set forth in numbered Sections 5 through 7 above.






9.
Reliance. In accepting the terms of this Agreement, Employee understands
and agrees that is he relying wholly on his own judgment, belief, and knowledge
and/or that of his own attorneys and advisors regarding this Agreement and the
matters and occurrences in question. Employee has not been influenced to any
extent whatsoever in entering this Agreement by representations or statements
made by any person, firm or entity hereby released, or by persons representing
or acting for them or on their behalf employed. Employee’s decision to sign
this Agreement and general release is entirely voluntary and with full
understanding of its consequences and without being coerced or threatened with
retaliation of any sort. He and his advisors have been given ample opportunity
to ask questions, consider, read, review and analyze this Agreement and general
release and Employee acknowledges that he fully understands its terms and
conditions.






10.
Company Obligations. Advance agrees that it will not by any means or in
any media, make or provide any comment, information, communication, expression,
statement or depiction detrimental, injurious or derogatory to the interests of
Employee and further agrees that it will not disparage, denigrate or cast
Employee in an unfavorable light in any manner. Advance represents that it has
no intention to bring any action against Employee and will not bring any such
action against Employee for anything currently known by Advance and relating to
Employee’s employment with Advance.

11.
Confidential. The parties will treat this Agreement as strictly
confidential, and will accordingly not disclose the terms and conditions hereof
to any third party except in the course of any judicial proceedings relating to
the enforcement of this Agreement, pursuant to a court order, or as otherwise
required by law.






12.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement (and the attached Exhibits) constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties and the terms herein are considered by
said parties to be contractual in nature and not a mere recital. No change or
modification of this Agreement will be valid unless it is in writing and signed
by the parties hereto. If any term of this Agreement conflicts with any of the
terms of the Employment Agreement, or any other contract or agreement between
Employee and Advance, the terms of this Agreement will control. This Agreement
and the other documents it references and modifies, constitute and contains the
full, complete and entire agreement and understanding concerning Employee’s
employment, all compensation of any nature due Employee and the other subject
matters addressed herein between the parties, and supersedes and replaces all
prior negotiations and all agreements proposed or otherwise, whether written or
oral, concerning the subject matters contained or referenced herein.






13.
Specific Performance. Employee acknowledges that it would be impossible
to determine the amount of damages that would result from any breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement by Employee and that the remedy at law for any
breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this Agreement would
likely be inadequate and, accordingly, agrees that Advance shall, in addition to
any other rights or remedies which they may have, be entitled to seek such
equitable and injunctive relief as may be available from any court of competent
jurisdiction to restrain Employee from violating any of the provisions of this
Agreement. In connection with any action or proceeding for injunctive relief,
Employee hereby waives the claim or defense that a remedy at law alone is
adequate and agrees, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to have each
provision of this Agreement specifically enforced against him, without the
necessity of posting bond or other security against him, and consents to the
entry of injunctive relief enjoining or restraining any breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement.






14.
Return of Corporate Property. Employee hereby agrees that he will
immediately turn over to Advance all files, documents, notes or other records
(of any form or nature, including but not limited to tape, disk or other
electronic storage method) in his possession or control (or the







7










possession or
control of his attorneys) pertaining to the operation, business, personnel
and/or affairs of Advance and that he, and his attorneys and agents, will not
retain copies of any such files, notes, documents or records and further that he
will not disclose the contents of any such files, notes, documents or records to
any other person, entity, agency, association, business, organization, firm or
corporation. Employee further covenants and agrees that he will not at any time
disclose to any other person, entity, agency, association, business,
organization, firm or corporation any information regarding the operations,
business and affairs of Advance other than information which is customarily made
available to the general public, without the prior written consent of Advance or
except as may be required by law or legal process after prior notice to Advance
and a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances for Advance to evaluate the
necessity of such proposed disclosure and to seek to oppose or limit it.







15.
Notices. Any and all notices, designations, consents, offers,
acceptances, or any other communications provided for herein shall be given in
writing and shall be deemed given on the date received if sent by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested; or on the date actually received if

or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable that the court is
empowered to modify or redraft the invalid or unenforceable provision to one
which is valid and enforceable and comes closest to fulfilling the intent of the
parties as expressed in the original provision. In the event that the court can
not redraft or modify the provision, then this Agreement shall be construed in
all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted.






18.
Successors and Assigns Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of Advance and Employee and their respective
heirs, legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns,
provided that Employee may not assign his rights or delegate his obligations
hereunder.






19.
No Waiver. The failure by Advance to enforce any of its rights hereunder
shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such rights, unless such waiver is in
writing and signed by the waiving party. Waiver of any one breach shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any other breach of the same or any other provision
hereof.






20.
No Construction Against Any Party. Legal counsel for each of the
respective parties (Employee and Advance) reviewed this Agreement. This
Agreement is the product of informed negotiations among Employee and Advance and
if any part of this Agreement is deemed to be unclear or ambiguous, it shall be

benefit program provided by Advance, except as expressly provided for herein and

WHEREAS, Code section 409A is effective as to amounts deferred after 2004; and

WHEREAS, the Company wants to assure that the requirements and
restrictions of Code section 409A will not apply to vested benefits earned or deferred under the Plan prior to January 1, 2005; and

WHEREAS, the Company has reserved the right to amend the Plan and the Company desires to amend the Plan without reducing the benefits available to
participants; and

WHEREAS, the Compensation &
Benefits Committee recommends that the specified amendments be approved.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Plan is amended so that the benefits provided under the Plan are limited to (i) benefits which are earned or accrued and vested or nonforfeitable as of December 31, 2004

under the Plan which are not vested or nonforfeitable as of December 31, 2004, (ii) benefits earned or accrued on or after January 1, 2005 and (iii) any earnings or losses attributable to the benefits described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii).


RESOLVED FURTHER, that the appropriate officers of the

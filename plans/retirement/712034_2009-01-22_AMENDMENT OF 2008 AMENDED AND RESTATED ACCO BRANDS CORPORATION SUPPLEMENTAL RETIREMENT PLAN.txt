WHEREAS,
the Company sponsors the 2008 Amended and Restated ACCO Brands Corporation
Supplemental Retirement Plan (the “SRP”);



WHEREAS,
the Company may amend the Plan at any time; and



WHEREAS,
in connection with the freeze of the ACCO Brands Corporation Pension Plan for

THEREFORE, the Company amends the SRP, effective the date hereof, as
follows:



1.    Capitalized
terms not defined herein shall have the meaning as defined under the
Plan.



2.    Section
3(g) shall be added to Section 3, to immediately follow Section 3(f), as
follows:



“(g)         Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Plan is frozen effective March 7,
2009, and accordingly:



(i)    No
Participant shall accrue any supplemental annual retirement benefit (or
pre-retirement survivor annuity benefit that may be payable thereon) on and
after March 7, 2009;



(ii)    No
compensation increases earned by a Participant on and after March 7, 2009 shall
be taken into account to determine the amount of any accrued benefit due and
owing to any Participant on and after March 7, 2009; and



(iii)    No
service of any Participant shall be taken into account for purposes of benefit
accruals on and after March 7, 2009 in determining the amount of the
Participant’s accrued benefit under the Plan;



provided,
that Participants shall continue to earn vesting service for the purposes of
determining the Participant’s entitlement to a nonforfeitable benefit upon
retirement or other severance of employment under the Plan after March 7,
2009.”



3.    Section
2(f), the definition of Eligible Employee, is
amended by adding, immediately following the last sentence thereof, the
following sentence:



“Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no person, who is not a Participant,
shall become an Eligible Employee after March 6, 2009.”

































WHEREFORE,
the Company has caused this Amendment to be executed by a duly authorized
officer as of this 20th day of January, 2009.

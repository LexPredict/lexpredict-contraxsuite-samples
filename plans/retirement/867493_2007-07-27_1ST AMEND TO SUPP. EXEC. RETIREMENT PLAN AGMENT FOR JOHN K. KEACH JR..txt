FIRST
AMENDMENT

TO
THE

HOMEFEDERAL
BANK

SUPPLEMENTAL
EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN AGREEMENT

FOR

JOHN
K. KEACH, JR.







THIS
FIRST AMENDMENT is adopted this 24
day of July, 2007, effective as of January 1, 2005, by and between HOMEFEDERAL
BANK f/k/a HOME FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK, a state-chartered bank located in
Columbus, Indiana (the “Bank”), and John K. Keach, Jr. (the
“Executive”).




The
Bank and the Executive executed the
SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN AGREEMENT on May 22, 1991, and amended
it
several times (the “First Agreement”).  The parties amended and
restated the First Agreement on April 1, 2001 (the “Second
Agreement”).  The First and Second Agreements are referred to
collectively herein as the “Prior Agreement”.




The
undersigned hereby amend the Prior
Agreements for the purpose of bringing the Prior Agreements into compliance
with
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  Therefore, the following
changes shall be made:




The
following Section 1.2a shall be
added to the Agreement immediately following Section 1.2:






1.2a


“Specified
Employee” means a key employee (as defined in Section 416(i) of the
Code without regard to paragraph 5 thereof) of the Bank if any
stock of
the Bank or any entity required to be aggregated with the Bank
under
Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code is publicly traded on an established
securities market or otherwise.









Section
1.4 of the Agreement shall be
deleted in its entirety and replaced by the following:






1.4


“Termination
of Employment” means the termination of the Executive’s employment
with the Bank for reasons other than death or
Disability.  Whether a Termination of Employment takes place is
determined based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the
termination of the Executive’s employment.  A Termination of
Employment will be considered to have occurred if it is reasonably
anticipated that:













(a)


the
Executive will not perform any services for the Bank after Termination
of
Employment, or













(b)


the
Executive will continue to provide services to the Bank at an annual
rate
that is less than fifty percent (50%) of the bona fide services
rendered
during the immediately preceding twelve (12) months of
employment.

Section
2.1.1 of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced by the
following:






2.1.1


Amount
of Benefit.  The annual retirement benefit under this
Section 2.1 is eighty-two thousand six hundred sixty-four dollars
($82,664).









The
following Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4
shall be added to the Agreement immediately following Section
2.1.2:






2.2


Restriction
on Timing of Distributions.  Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive
is considered a Specified Employee at Termination of Employment
under such
procedures as established by the Bank in accordance with Section
409A of
the Code, benefit distributions that are made upon Termination
of
Employment may not commence earlier than six (6) months after the
date of
such Termination of Employment; provided, however, that the six (6)
month delay required under this Section 2.2 shall not apply to
the portion
of any payment resulting from the Executive’s “involuntary separation from
service” (as defined in Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(n) and including a
“separation from service for good reason,” as defined in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.409A-1(n)(2)) that (a) is payable no later than the last day
of
the second year following the year in which the separation from
service
occurs, and (b) does not exceed two times the lesser of (i) the
Executive’s annualized compensation for the year prior to the year in
which the separation from services occurs, or (ii) the dollar limit
described in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code.  Therefore, in the
event this Section 2.2 is applicable to the Executive,
any distribution which would otherwise be paid to the Executive
within the
first six months following the Termination of Employment shall
be
accumulated and paid to the Executive
in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the
Termination of Employment.  All subsequent distributions shall
be paid in the manner specified.











2.3


Distributions
Upon Income Inclusion Under Section 409A of the Code.  Upon
the inclusion of any amount into the Executive’s income as a result of the
failure of this non-qualified deferred compensation plan to comply
with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent such
tax
liability can be covered by the amount the Bank has accrued with
respect
to the Bank’s obligations hereunder, a distribution shall be made as soon
as is administratively practicable following the discovery of the
plan
failure.











2.4


Change
in Form or Timing of Distributions.  All changes in the
form or timing of distributions hereunder must comply with the
following
requirements.  The
changes:











(a)


may
not accelerate the time or schedule of any distribution, except
as
provided in Section 409A of the Code and the regulations
thereunder;











(b)


must,
for benefits distributable under Section 2.1, delay the commencement
of
distributions for a minimum of five (5) years from the date the
first
distribution was originally scheduled to be made;
and





















2





















(c)


must
take effect not less than twelve (12) months after the election
is
made.

Amendments
and Termination






7.1


Amendments.  This
Agreement may be amended only by a written agreement signed by
the Bank
and the Executive.  However, the Bank may unilaterally amend
this Agreement to conform with written directives to the Bank from
its
auditors or banking regulators or to comply with legislative changes
or
tax law, including without limitation Section 409A of the Code
and any and
all Treasury regulations and guidance promulgated
thereunder.











7.2


Plan
Termination Generally.  The Bank and the
Executive may terminate this Agreement at any
time.  The benefit hereunder shall be the amount the Bank has
accrued with respect to the Bank’s obligations
hereunder.  Except as provided in Section 7.3, the termination
of this Agreement shall not cause a distribution of benefits under
this
Agreement.  Rather, after such termination benefit distributions
will be made at the earliest distribution event permitted under
Article 2
or Article 3.











7.3


Plan
Terminations Under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in Section 7.2, if this Agreement terminates in
the
following circumstances:














(a)


Within
thirty (30) days before or twelve (12) months after a change in
the
ownership or effective control of the Bank or of the Corporation,
or in
the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Bank
or of the
Corporation as described in Section 409A(2)(A)(v) of the Code,
provided
that termination of this Agreement was effected through an irrevocable
action taken by the Bank and provided further that all distributions
are
made no later than twelve (12) months following such termination
of the
Agreement and that all the Bank's arrangements which are
substantially similar to the Agreement are terminated so the Executive
and
all participants in the similar arrangements are required to receive
all amounts of compensation deferred under the terminated arrangements
within twelve (12) months of the termination of the
arrangements;













(b)


Upon
the Bank’s dissolution or with the approval of a bankruptcy court provided
that the amounts deferred under the Agreement are included in the
Executive's gross income in the latest of (i) the calendar year
in which
the Agreement terminates; (ii) the calendar year in which the amount
is no
longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; or (iii) the
first
calendar year in which the distribution is administratively practical;
or













(c)


Upon
the Bank’s termination of this and all other non-account balance plans (as
referenced in Section 409A of the Code or the regulations thereunder),
provided that all distributions are made no earlier than twelve
(12)
months and no later than twenty-four (24) months following such
termination, provided further that the termination of this Agreement
does
not occur proximate to the downturn in the financial health of
the Bank
and provided further that the Bank does not adopt any new non-account
balance plans for a minimum of three (3) years following the date
of such
termination;




















5


















then
the
Bank may distribute the amount the present value of the benefits payable
to the
Executive under this Agreement upon his Termination of Employment, using
the
actuarial factors that would be used to compute the present value of benefits
under § 280G of the Code, determined as of the date of the termination of
the Agreement, to the Executive in a lump sum subject to the above
terms.











Section
8.7 of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced
by the
following:













8.7


Compliance
with Section 409A.  This Agreement shall at all times be
administered and the provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
any and
all regulations thereunder, including such regulations as may be
promulgated after the effective date of this
Agreement.

WITNESS OF THE
ABOVE, the Bank and the Executive hereby consent to this First
Amendment.

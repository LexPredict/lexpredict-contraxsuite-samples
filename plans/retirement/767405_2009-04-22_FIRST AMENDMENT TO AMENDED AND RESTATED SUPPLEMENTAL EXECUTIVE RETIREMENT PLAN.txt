This
First Amendment to the Rurban Financial Corp. Amended and Restated Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan Agreement for Mark A. Klein (“Agreement”) is made
effective as of this 20th day of
April, 2009.




WHEREAS,
Rurban Financial Corp. (“RFC”), The State Bank and Trust Company (“Subsidiary”)
and Mark A. Klein (“Executive”) previously entered into the Agreement on
November 19, 2008 for the purpose of providing the Executive with the benefits
described therein; and




WHEREAS,
RFC, the Subsidiary and the Executive wish to amend the Agreement to increase
the Executive’s Early Retirement Benefit and Retirement Benefit (each as defined
in the Agreement).




NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of foregoing, the services performed in the past and
to be performed in the future, as well as of the mutual promise and covenants
herein contained, the parties agree as follows:






1.


Section
3.1 of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following
is substituted therefor:









3.1           RETIREMENT BENEFIT. If the
Executive Terminates on or after his Retirement Date, the Corporation shall pay
the Executive a Retirement Benefit equal to twenty percent (20%) of his Annual
Direct Salary.  Payment of the Retirement Benefit shall commence on
the first day of the month following the date of Termination and shall be
payable in substantially equal monthly installments for a period of one hundred
eighty (180) months.






2.


Section
3.2 of the Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following
is substituted therefor:









3.2           EARLY RETIREMENT
BENEFIT.  If the Executive Terminates prior to his Retirement
Date, provided that the Executive has at least five (5) Years of Service, the
Executive shall be entitled to receive an Early Retirement Benefit based on his
age on the date of Termination equal to the percentage of his Annual Direct
Salary as set forth below:






Age

The
first sentence of the second full paragraph of Section 5 of the Agreement
is hereby deleted in its entirety and the following is substituted
therefor:









If the
Internal Revenue Service subsequently and finally decides that the amount of
compensation and benefits (including after the reduction applied under this
Section 5) will generate Excise Taxes on compensation and benefits (other than
those amounts described in Sections 6.9 and 6.10), the Executive will
immediately remit an additional amount to the Change Entity equal to the
difference between the amount paid (other than those amounts described in
Sections 6.9 and 6.10) and minimum amount necessary to avoid the imposition of
Excise Taxes.




IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, have caused this First
Amendment to be duly executed in their respective names and, in the case of RFC
and the Subsidiary, by their authorized representatives, as of the date first
set forth above.
